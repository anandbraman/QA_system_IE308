REUTERS/Saul Loeb/Pool U.S. President Barack Obama delivers a live televised address to the nation on his plans for military action against the Islamic State, from the Cross Hall of the White House in Washington September 10, 2014. JP Morgan won't say whether personal information belonging to President Barack Obama, who reportedly held one of the company's credit cards as of July, was compromised in a massive data breach that was disclosed in an SEC filing Thursday. Darin Oduyoye, a company spokesman, told Business Insider in an email that JPMorgan was "not commenting" beyond their initial statement. JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick added the company would not identify specific customers. "To protect customers' privacy, we do not publicly confirm, deny or otherwise identify customers," Hartwick said. A White House press pool report published in July noted Obama used his "JPMorgan card" when he visited a barbecue restaurant in Austin, Texas.  According to the SEC filing, data from about 76 million households and 7 million small businesses was "compromised" in a recent cyberattack. "User contact information — name, address, phone number and email address — and internal JPMorgan Chase information relating to such users have been compromised," the SEC filing said. The filing indicated these figures were from a previously disclosed cyberattack. "However, there is no evidence that account information for such affected customers — account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers — was compromised during this attack," said the filing. This statement would appear to contradict a New York Times report published in August that indicated hackers obtained "checking and savings account information" from JPMorgan in a "series of coordinated attacks." That same month, Bloomberg published a report that said the FBI was investigating whether a potential hack into JPMorgan's systems originated in Russia.  The White House and Secret Service did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider about whether they knew if any of Obama's personal information was compromised in an attack on JPMorgan.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFile photo of Kellogg's cereal boxes stacked in a supermarket in New York(Reuters) - Cereal maker Kellogg Co's  chief executive officer is planning to meet with cookies and snacks maker United Biscuits Ltd  to discuss a possible 2 billion pound ($3.23 billion) offer for the British company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Kellogg's CEO John Byrant will meet with the company in London, the Journal reported the people as saying. Kellogg has hired an adviser to evaluate a bid for the maker of McVities Digestive biscuits, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in August. United Biscuits' private equity owners, Blackstone Group LP  and PAI Partners, have been working on plans for a sale or a public share listing that would take place by the end of the year. The source also said Blackstone and PAI Partners would opt for a sale over an IPO if an offer was at a "very good price" above 2 billion pounds. Rival Burton's Biscuits is also working with banks to raise financing for a bid for United Biscuits, banking sources have told Reuters. Burton's, which was bought by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan last year, is one of three firms through to the second and final round of bidding, along with Kellogg and Turkish biscuit company Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi , and bids are due by Oct. 31, the banking sources said. Last month, Ulker Biskuvi's owner Yildiz Holding said it was interested in investing in the British snacks producer, while Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp  said it was planning a solo bid. Other companies linked with United Biscuits include Saudi Arabian food producer Savola Group , Italy's Ferrero, and Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital. United Biscuits and Kellogg were not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bangalore; Editing by Bernard Orr) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Alejandro AcunaLONDON (Reuters) - Global investors are starting to cut back on stock market positions, wary of a wave of financial market turbulence in the final quarter of 2014 as the era of cheap money ends. The tide turned abruptly this week with the close of the third quarter and major stock markets have lurched down at the start of October, a month associated with previous market shakeouts including the 1929 and 1987 crashes. Two weeks earlier the S&amp;P 500 &lt;.SPX&gt; reached an all time high, prompting many investors to speculate that shares were too expensive by most historical measures. Since reaching that peak on Sept. 19, Wall Street has dropped nearly 4 percent and many expect more volatility to come. "The last three years have been quite good for equities but now it's going be a lot harder. Unfortunately you've now got to invest with seat-belts on... You have to accept more volatility. We expect the next six months to be very challenging," said Remi Ajewole, a multi asset fund manager at Schroders, one of Europe's largest independent investment groups. Markets are starting to price in the U.S. Federal Reserve calling time on the easy money policies which it brought in as economic life support after the financial crisis of 2008. Quantitative easing, a pillar of this policy which involved the Fed buying up bonds to add liquidity to the financial system, is due to end later this month. A second aspect, keeping official interest rates in the United States at historic lows, is also expected to end within months as the world's largest economy strengthens. The prospect of a relative scarcity of U.S. dollars has driven the currency higher in recent weeks. While this may seem a benign development to American consumers who see their international purchasing power increase, it is proving disruptive to financial markets. A new period of dollar strength risks drawing American investment back home, fearful of heavy currency losses on overseas assets. This in turn can affect U.S corporations because it devalues their overseas earnings in dollar terms and risks making American exports less competitive. Charles Morris, London-based head of Absolute Return at HSBC Global Asset Management, said the currency market was going through one of its phases when a decisive dollar move pushes everything else in the opposite direction. "Every single currency is going down except the dollar which is shooting up like a rocket. It's like a water bed with a big fat man on it," he said. Morris said he has been reducing risk before the last quarter, cutting back on equities, high yield credit and emerging market debt while adding dollar assets which he calls "the number one defensive thing you can do". However, some investors point to a risk that the end of cheap money could affect smaller U.S. companies. "In the U.S. we are very sensitive to small cap stocks. We think they were the primary beneficiary of QE and in an environment where the Fed turns off the liquidity taps, they could struggle," Ajewole said, adding that while her Schroders team still regards stocks as "a good asset class", she has reduced exposure. A Reuters poll of investment managers around the world published on Sept. 30 found a sense of caution manifested in people putting their biggest bets since March on bonds, which are typically regarded as a shelter against market volatility.   ON THE BRIGHT SIDE Some investors nonetheless say the overall economic outlook remains benign. The Fed raising interest rates is a symptom of robust economic growth, they say, even if it carries risks. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is going in an opposite direction with easier monetary policy aimed at jump-starting a moribund economy. The Reuters poll found Europeans raising equity exposure, partly on account of optimism for corporate earnings if European companies get access to cheap money. "For the remainder of the year we expect higher volatility in markets, but still prefer equities over other asset classes," said Boris Willems, a strategist at UBS Global Asset Management. "Monetary policy overall continues to be accommodative, in spite of some policy divergence over the coming months and years... The OECD (developed) economies remain in expansion." The VIX index of volatility, known as "the fear index", sits at around 17, up nearly 50 percent since the end of August. However, it remains about 80 percent below the peak reached in the crisis year of 2008 after swinging between 20 and around 47 through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at British fund manager Standard Life Investments, says the rise in volatility belies what should be seen as an opportunity to snap up good stocks on the cheap. "The underlying trend in corporate cash flow remains positive. The only reason that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in 2015 is because the U.S. economy would be strong enough, demonstrating tighter labor markets and thus reassuring investors that policy tightening is needed to ensure the recovery is long-lasting," he said.   (Additional reporting by John Geddie; editing by David Stamp) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Neil Hall (Reuters) - As bond traders began what they thought would be a quiet day last Friday, a simple headline crossed their screens: “William H. Gross joins Janus Capital." Confusion ensued. Several asset managers and traders wondered whether the news was about Pimco's co-founder, known to most on Wall Street simply as Bill Gross, or someone else with the same name. "The question was, 'Is it THAT William H. Gross?'" said Lou Brien, a veteran market strategist at DRW Trading, a 22-year-old trading firm in Chicago active in futures markets. It was indeed. The 70-year-old fund manager had quit as chief investment officer of the $2 trillion asset manager and portfolio manager of the world's largest bond fund, the Pimco Total Return Fund, after more than four decades amid tensions with management. As the news sank in, fixed income traders jumped. Several said they first tried to figure out the biggest holdings of the Total Return Fund, which had $222 billion under management before Gross bolted. Then, they began selling assets that they believed to be the biggest holdings of the fund, including U.S. Treasuries, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and high-yield bonds, anticipating massive redemptions. Clients immediately started withdrawing funds, sending assets in the direction of rivals TCW, DoubleLine Capital, BlackRock Inc and Western Asset Management Co. The Total Return Fund saw $23 billion in outflows in September, with its worst day of withdrawals in its history on Friday. Pimco declined to comment for this story. "People scrambled to see what their positions were. People were trying to front-run any liquidation," DRW’s Brien said. The reaction across financial markets to news of a job change by one man was unprecedented, and the ripples still flow through the bond market. It will also feed into a months-long debate over whether massive asset managers are systemically important, like the global banks, and, therefore, should be regulated more tightly. Interviews with more than a dozen bond traders and managers about what went on in their minds and in the markets after the news of Gross's departure broke, paint the fullest picture yet of what happened in various markets in its aftermath. "This event will go down as the single-largest movement of capital as a result of one person's move from one firm to another," said David Barse, chief executive of New York-based Third Avenue Management, which had about $13 billion under management at July 31. The shock at Pimco rocked a market that was already nervous. Several traders said it may spark a deeper analysis of the depth and liquidity in fixed income markets, especially after financial reforms took away the incentive for large banks to hold inventory of fixed income assets that could have acted as a shock absorber. Regulators are watching, sources familiar with the situation said. The U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department are talking to market participants about Pimco, but they have not warned investors against pulling their funds, they said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the fixed income market, is also monitoring developments, another person said. "We are obviously trying to understand the outflows and what is going on. I think it is a natural consequence when you have somebody so high profile like Bill Gross moving out of a firm," Daniel Gallagher, a Republican member of the SEC, told Reuters on Tuesday. "But I hope and expect it won't become too much of a concern as the market soaks up the information about his departure." To be sure, Gross's exit doesn't appear sufficient to threaten the stability of the entire financial system. While the reaction in the markets was swift and some of its effects linger even now, these market sources said, it appears to have been largely contained. "Markets have had a more shaky feel to them over the past few days," said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager of Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has $88 billion in assets under management. Brady said while markets started to move a bit before the Gross announcement, they have gotten more volatile since Friday.    REUTERS/Jim YoungBill Gross, aka the Bond KingKNEE-JERK REACTION In the minutes following the news of Gross's exit on Friday, the reaction across financial markets was clear. The news was released at 8:28 a.m. Eastern time. CBOT U.S. 10-year T-note futures, one of the most popularly traded U.S. futures contracts, saw volume quadruple in the minutes that followed because Pimco has a large position in Treasuries. More than 200,000 contracts traded between 8:35 a.m. and 9 a.m. as prices dropped and bond yields rose. The benchmark 10-year Treasury's yield rose to 2.55 percent from 2.50. Investors also sold TIPs, causing those yields to spike. Risk premiums on junk bonds rose broadly as well in anticipation of more selling and spreads widened out sharply. Eurodollar &lt;0#ED:&gt; contracts, arguably the world's most widely traded futures, saw the two and three-year part of the curve cheapen. Shares of Allianz SE, Pimco's German parent fell more than 6 percent Friday, while those of Janus Capital Group soared 43 percent. On desks, traders said they smelled panic. "I felt that dealer desks got defensive," said one loan trader, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. "It was a tough day to get a bid." Another loan trader said some people saw a buying opportunity, thinking, "Let's get out of here and let's buy something else, probably better." Several of Pimco's rivals said they saw immediate inflows as investors made that trade. "We have definitely had institutional assets in (our) direction," said Chris Orndorff, senior portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California which manages $470 billion. Jeffrey Gundlach, Gross's arch-rival, said on Monday his investment firm, DoubleLine Capital, saw between $400 million and $500 million of net inflows on Friday. "There has been a significant amount of fixed income assets in motion based on recent news," Ron Redell, president of DoubleLine Funds, told Reuters. "We believe DoubleLine, as well as other asset managers, are receiving an increase in interest." Sources close to BlackRock Inc said the world's largest asset manager was also seeing inflows. It has been buying Treasuries and other fixed income instruments as it is trying to win market share, one of the sources said. "Given strong performance across our fixed income franchise, we've been seeing solid flows all year. In recent days, conversations with clients, particularly around our Total Return and Strategic Income Opportunities funds have increased greatly," a BlackRock spokeswoman said.     EXACERBATING FEAR Several traders said Gross’s departure came at a time when risk assets, such as stocks and high yield bonds and loans, were already trading off. Concerns about weak European growth, protests in Hong Kong and the first Ebola case in the United States have contributed to safe-haven buying in Treasuries. High yield spreads were under pressure as well because of ongoing concerns about economic growth prospects worldwide and as many investors see that market as overvalued. Still, traders said there was no mistaking the Gross effect. The nervousness triggered by his exit seeped into this week, and much of it has lingered. New issues of corporate bonds effectively stopped on Monday. Now, while the selling in bonds has tapered off and primary markets have bounced back, the stress is continuing elsewhere. The bid-offer yield spreads in riskier bonds including junk bonds, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and TIPs have remained wider than usual, according to Western Asset's Orndorff. If redemptions at Pimco were to increase, Orndoff said, "this could be the beginning of a pretty ugly move" in the bond market. "They could be coming in successive waves," Orndoff said.   (Additional reporting by Lisa Lee, Billy Cheung, Jennifer Ablan, David Gaffen in New York, Ross Kerber in Boston and Sarah Lynch in Washington; Writing by Paritosh Bansal; Editing by John Pickering) FREE AppDownload
MorningstarThe Bill Gross era at PIMCO is over, and the Dan Ivascyn era has begun. Ivascyn, manager of the PIMCO Income Fund, is the new CIO of the Newport Beach bond fund firm. Gross will likely be remembered as one of the most important figures in bonds ever. He grew the firm's Total Return Fund to as big as $293 billion. Unfortunately, Gross leaves the fund after 17 straight months of outflows totaling nearly $92 billion. PIMCO, however, will remind you that some funds have seen significant inflows. "Investors have shown confidence in PIMCO as evidenced by significant inflows into strategies such as the PIMCO Income Fund, which has seen over $6.5bn of net inflows year to date in 2014," the firm said on Wednesday. That's Ivascyn's fund. And while that amount is small, it's a massive percentage gain for a fund that currently has $38 billion in assets. PIMCOThe charts above come from a new report from Morningstar. As you can see, while the Total Return Fund has lost around 30% of assets under Gross' purview, the Income Fund has blown up by around 30% under Ivascyn's purview. Sure, the dollar amounts are not comparable. But the direction is surely something PIMCO must be excited about. FREE AppDownload
AP Photo/Nati HarnikWarren Buffett is the second-richest person in the US, according to Forbes, with an estimated net worth of $67 billion.There are 12 million millionaires in the world, but only 2,325 billionaires. That's an exclusive club, of which the likes of Warren Buffett, Jack Ma, and Oprah Winfrey are members.  Digging into research firm Wealth-X's new Billionaire Census, we found that billionaires have some commonalities.  Such as: • If there is an average billionaire, he or she is worth around $3 billion. Or roughly one Snapchat. • Billionaires have a combined wealth of $7.3 trillion, a 12% increase from last year. That's higher than the market capitalization of all the Dow Jones companies put together. Put another way, if all the world's billionaires decided to join forces and become a country, their combined wealth would be greater than the GDP than Japan.  • The 2,325 billionaires control 4% of the wealth in the world. The more inclusive 1% of the world's population controls 40% of the wealth.  • For every three million people on earth there's a single billionaire. Lonely, right?  • Europe has more billionaires than any other region. The Old World has 775 of them. • The US has more than any other country. America has 571 billionaires, with 57 newly minted members since last year.  • 60% of billionaires made their wealth themselves, like Jack Ma and Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, 26.9% became billionaires from re-investing inherited wealth, and 13% of them inherited their billionaire status straight out.  • Getting to billionaire status takes a while. Your average billionaire is 63 years old, and 93% of the world's billionaire population is over 45.   • Billionaires invest a lot in real estate, at about $160 million per person. They tend to have four properties — it supports "the billionaire lifestyle," the report says.  • Billionaires tend to have "non-real estate luxury assets." They sound really fun. "For example, one in 30 billionaires owns a sports team or a racehorse," the report says. "Other significant luxury assets include yachts, planes, cars, and art."  • Billionaires are into matrimony. 65% of them are married. • Billionaires love the Ivy League. While billionaires went to over 700 different universities, the Ivies have the most grads: 25 went to the University of Pennsylvania, 22 went to Harvard, and 20 went to Yale.  • But a surprising number of billionaires don't have a college degree. 35% never finished undergrad. • Billionaires tend to work in finance. Almost 20% of billionaires made their careers on Wall Street or its equivalents.  And they're most likely living in New York.  FREE AppDownload
CNBCWarren BuffettWarren Buffett announced Thursday on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is buying Van Tuyl Group, the fifth-largest car dealership company in the U.S. The dealership group has been privately owned since 1955, but the first order of business is a name change: It will be called Berkshire Hathaway Automotive. Buffett isn't done yet. He told CNBC that he may buy even more dealerships. Berkshire Hathaway already owns the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and NetJets. He joked after the announcement that he now has automobiles covered, but of course he already owns almost 33 million shares of General Motors, worth $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. "This acquisition shows the value and importance of dealerships such as the Van Tuyl Group in the automotive ecosystems," Cox Automotive President Sandy Schwartz told Business Insider. Cox is the parent company of Kelley Blue Book, online car sales site AutoTrader.com, and Manheim, a big auto auction company. "As we continue to innovate and find more effective and efficient ways to further our industry and serve our customers, it's exciting to have a leader like Warren Buffett be a part of the automotive community," Schwartz added. So why did Buffett do the Van Tuyl Group deal? Money! Nothing complicated here. As Amy Wilson noted in Automotive News in March: "In 2013, the average U.S. dealership produced return on equity of 29 percent, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That figure has risen in four of the past five years and is now more than double the 12 percent return recorded in 2008 when U.S. vehicle sales collapsed."  The Van Tuyl Group does $8 billion in annual revenue, so it's likely benefiting from that increase in return on equity. The Wall Street Journal, in reporting on the deal, pointed out that the company's family owners didn't want to sell to a private equity firm — a firm that would have loved that near-30% return! But a private equity deal would have meant an exit in something like 7 years. The Van Tuyl owners wanted a "permanent home" Buffett said on CNBC.  But the Business Needs Some Help Return on equity is one thing. Profits are something else. "It's incredibly expensive to sell cars," said Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. He pointed out that a lot of dealerships could benefit from gaining the economies of scale that a bigger company offers — especially for so-called "back office" operations.  The management of the dealership gets to stick around, but Berkshire Hathaway provides much-needed improvements. "I think a lot of dealers will be happy to have a buyer like Buffett in the market," Szakaly said. The Auto Market In The U.S. Is Booming September auto sales weren't quite as torrid as August's — but new vehicle deliveries still topped a 16-million annual pace by a good margin (August came in at a whopping 17.5-million annual pace). The recovery from the dark days of 2008-09 is complete, so Buffett can buy a host of dealerships with limited risk of a major retreat to 2009 sales levels.  Market observers expect sales to remain robust for a while — and then, barring an external shock such as a spike in oil prices or a recession or a big leap in interest rates, settle into a comfortable 15-16 million yearly pace. Buffett already has a hand in the broad, consumer component in the auto market through Berkshire's ownership of insurer GEICO. So rather than play the auto recovery by buying more stock in car companies — and knowing that he doesn't want to gobble up an entire car company whole — he does the next logical thing and starts acquiring dealerships. Dealerships Do More Than Sell New Cars Dealer profits also come from the follow-on business: Service and used-car sales (people trade in old cars to get new cars). And then there's the profits they can generate from facilitating financing on new cars and leasing deals. Not to mention insurance (enter GEICO). These are enterprises that have multiple lines of business, each contributing to a healthy bottom line when times are good — and even when times are bad, as people tend to need transportation no matter what the economy is doing. Dealerships, even thought many are now owned by big dealer conglomerates, are still local businesses. Buffett has shown with his newspaper acquisitions that he likes local when there are compelling business reasons to invest in the idea. A well-run car dealership selling the right vehicles in a community can develop something of a monopoly that's analogous to what local papers can do with local advertisers — a process that's supported by carmakers, who restrict the number of franchised dealers that can sell their cars in a particular region. Cheap Capital — And More Of It By owning dealerships, Berkshire Hathaway will be able to use the profits they generate as a source of zero-interest lending to fund new deals — and of course take on additional leverage as needed (at the terms he's accustomed to) to magnify his returns. Buffett also has the opportunity to use the Van Tuyl deal to almost create more profits. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, as the Wall Street Journal reported in 2011, a wave of consolidation hit the dealer business, meaning that if you survived, you got to sell more cars — and make more money.  If Berkshire Hathaway buys up dealerships, it can effectively absorb its competition and create the conditions for Berkshire Automotive to be even more profitable. Buffett says more deals are on the way, and experts on the dealership business have been pointing out on Thursday that the industry is fragmented and ripe for additional consolidation.  "This is going to continue," the NADA's Szakaly said.   FREE AppDownload

John LaForge, commodities strategist at Ned Davis Research says gold is going to $660 an ounce. In an appearance on CNBC on Thursday, LaForge said that the end of the current "supercycle" for gold could push the precious metal down to $660 an ounce, or about 40% lower than where it is currently trading. LaForge said that in the 1980s, the price of gold fell about 65% from peak-to-trough as the precious metal enduring a 20-year bear market. And after hitting $1900 an ounce in 2011, gold should see a similar peak-to-trough decline in current cycle. "We know that commodities run in supercycles, and they eventually die. And gold looks like it's dying," LaForge said. "So $660 is certainly in the cards." LaForge did say, however, that the quantitative easing being undertaken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks could prop up gold and stop the current supercycle from deflating the way LaForge expects.  Gold was trading near $1214 an ounce on Thursday. Here's a chart of the last 20 years of gold prices. FRED Here's the full video from CNBC below.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe U.S. flag flies at the Burt GM auto dealer in DenverDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  on Thursday said it is recalling 117,651 newer vehicles in North America because a possible manufacturing defect could cause an electrical short and increase the risk of a crash. The largest U.S. automaker said about 1 percent of all the cars, pickup trucks and SUVs recalled are believed to have the potential defect in the chassis control module, where metal slivers could cause an electrical short that results in the vehicle stalling or not starting, a spokesman said. GM said it was unaware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the condition. The recall is GM's 69th this year, covering more than 29 million vehicles globally. The highest profile of the recalls was one earlier this year involving 2.6 million vehicles because of a defective ignition switch linked to at least 23 deaths. Affected are certain versions of the 2013-2014 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade SUVs; 2013-2014 Cadillac CTS sedans; 2014 Chevy Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave crossover vehicles; 2014 Chevy Express and GMC Savana vans; and 2014 Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy duty full-size pickup trucks. Of the affected vehicles, 97,540 are in the United States and the rest are in Canada, Mexico and are exports.

REUTERS/Eduardo MunozJPMorgan just revealed that 76 million households and seven million small businesses may have had their private data compromised in a recent cyberattack. "User contact information — name, address, phone number and email address — and internal JPMorgan Chase information relating to such users have been compromised," the company said in a new SEC filing. "However, there is no evidence that account information for such affected customers — account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers — was compromised during this attack." According to the filing, this is regarding a previously disclosed cyberattack. (Earlier Thursday, a JPMorgan spokesperson denied a New York Times report that there had been two cyberattacks in the past three months.) In August, Bloomberg reported that the FBI was investigating a possible Russian hack into JPMorgan's systems. The New York Times later reported that "checking and savings accounting information" was stolen, which Thursday's filing appears to refute. JPMorgan says it hasn't seen "any unusual customer fraud related to this incident." "The Firm continues to vigilantly monitor the situation and is continuing to investigate the matter," the company said. JPM shares were down 0.4% in after-hours trading. FREE AppDownload
Thomas Hawk/FlickrDon't be that guy.Bartending sounds like a cool job in theory. You learn how to make drinks, watch funny drunk people all night, and are paid to be in a bar. But the reality is a whole lot less fun, because bartending is a service job that can often show the unflattering side of humanity. Sloppy drunks, spills, rude clientele, and annoying orders are what bartenders around the world look forward to each night.

I'm not your personal bartender, so don't yell at me when I'm taking orders. If I skip you, it was probably an accident (unless I've told you previously that I will not wait on you). Just stay calm and you'll get your drink. Yelling, screaming and waving makes me move towards you slower or not at all.

WayfairWayfair's shares rose by as much as 27% Thursday in their first day of trading, giving the online home goods retailer a valuation of more than $3 billion. Despite its blockbuster debut, Wayfair is "hardly a household name," writes MarketWatch.  The Boston-based company became one of the biggest online purveyors of home goods in the U.S. practically overnight, with sales exploding to $916 million last year from $601 million in 2012. Wayfair's massive growth comes more than a decade after its founding, when it was called CSN Stores and sold speaker and television stands on the website RacksAndStands.com. Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah founded CSN with his Cornell classmate Steve Conine, in 2002. The generic name was chosen to avoid scaring off manufacturers who were burned by the dot-com crash, Shah said. "When we started in 2002, manufacturers didn’t want to hear the word 'Internet,'" he told Business Insider in a previous interview. Over the next eight years, the company launched more than 270 separate websites, each of which sold a very specific category of home goods. "Our view was that you just had to pick a category that was off the beaten track," Shah said. "You couldn’t focus on electronics or, you know, the same items that Amazon and others were selling." There was AllBarsStools.com, EveryMirror.com, and BedroomFurnitureDirect.com. Each website offered thousands of selections as well as editorial content on how to pick the right bar stool, or mirror or whatever category the site was selling. The idea was rooted in search engine optimization. Shah and Conine knew that by offering a huge selection on hundreds of categories, shoppers were likely to stumble their way through a Google search into shopping on a CSN website. By 2010, the company had about 4.8 million customers and sales of about $380 million.  But CSN Stores was having a hard time growing its repeat customer base, primarily because most shoppers had no idea that the websites were managed by the same brand. WayfairWayfair has been ramping up its merchandising efforts to give customers a better idea of how its products can come together to decorate an entire room. That's when Shah and Conine decided they needed to build the "ultimate home store" by rolling all of their 270 websites into one. To fund their effort, they raised about $200 million from four Boston-area venture capital firms including Spark Capital, Battery Ventures, Great Hill Partners, and HarbourVest Partners. It was their first round of outside capital. Wayfair.com was launched in September 2011 and the company spent the next year in the tedious process of closing each of the standalone websites. In 2011, the company also launched Joss &amp; Main, a home goods flash sales site similar to One Kings Lane and Gilt Home, but with a lower price point. In September 2012, Wayfair launched its first television marketing campaign and brand awareness rose from 6% to 27% over the next year, Shah said. The company now has more than 1,550 employees and access to more than 7 million products from 12,000 suppliers. Over the last year, Wayfair has been focusing on ramping up its merchandising efforts to give customers a better idea of how the site's products can come together to decorate an entire room. Executives say their typical customer is a woman between the ages fo 35 and 65 with an income level of $60,000 to $175,000. In a regulatory filing, Wayfair states that the U.S. home goods market is expected to grow to $297 billion by 2023 from about $233 billion last year, based on Euromonitor International data.  Online retailers accounted for about 7% of home goods sales last year, the company says. In the first six months of the year, Wayfair generated sales of $574.1 million, up from $383.2 million in the same period a year earlier.  But the company isn't profitable yet. Wayfair posted a net loss of $63.2 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to a loss of $24.3 million a year earlier.     FREE AppDownload
Reuters / Morteza Nikoubazl77 million Iranian are hungry for foreign products, while businesses seek Western partners, technology, and export markets. With US-Iranian nuclear negotiations reaching their deadline this November, businesses around the world are waiting in nervous anticipation to re-engage with one of the world’s largest economies.   Even with heavy sanctions, Iran was the world's 21st largest economy two years ago. The country is rich in high-demand natural resources, has an educated workforce, and increasingly well-developed processing and manufacturing capabilities.  “As soon as we suspend our major sanctions — which will happen very early in the agreement — the world will flood into Iran,” Wendy Sherman, the US's chief negotiator, told Voice of America last week. Iran has the word’s second-largest gas reserves, third-largest oil reserves, and significant rare earth deposits. The country’s 77 million consumers have been locked out of global markets thanks to UN, EU, and US sanctions following the country's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. But while international sanctions are relatively simple to lift through the UN and the European Union, American sanctions are more complex and politically sensitive, as lifting them will require cooperation from a US Congress often hostile to Iran. “I see tremendous opportunities for American companies, but quite honestly European companies right now are stealing their lunch,” former Canadian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Ken Lewis, told a group of Iranian Americans at a conference in Washington last week.  The former Canadian Ambassador compared Iran’s economic potential to Canada’s, given its mix of primary resources and human capital.  NIAC / Sima JafariFrom right, tech entrepreneur Christopher Schroeder, sanctions lawyer Erich Ferrari, and business analyst, Dr Bijan Khajehpour. At the conference, organized by the National Iranian American Council, panelists told attendees that European businesses were already starting to build connections and solidify business relationships. NIAC is one of the few US-based organizations lobbying for general sanctions to be lifted, in favor of narrow sanctions targeted at the regime's elite. Congress has been traditionally enthusiastic in imposing sanctions on Iran, and even with a nuclear deal, legislators may see Iran’s poor human rights record and support for designated terrorist organizations as justification for leaving some of them in place. Bijan Khajehpour, a strategic analyst and entrepreneur, said that Iran was not merely a source or raw materials, noting that sanctions had pushed the country to further develop its internal production capacity.  “We are looking at a market that is transforming, that is industrializing, and that is looking for that connection,” Khajehpour said, “what’s missing is the connection with the West and the advanced technology that brings… the leap forward is only possible with Western technology.” Tech entrepreneur and international business analyst Christopher Schroeder said the country also had tremendous potential for tech, internet, and e-commerce businesses. Schroeder noted that two-thirds of the population was under 35, Iran has the best internet penetration in the region, higher per-capita GDP than India and the highest share of engineering graduates in the world — yet internet and e-commerce sectors remained under-developed. “E-commerce is in its infancy, but it's a huge purchasing country, and it's one the most spectacular tourist destinations I've ever seen, and virtually none of it is booked online,” he said. “You know, venture capitalists start to light up a little bit.” Iran's government strictly blocks many American websites, including Youtube and Facebook. Reformists in the current government are advocating for controls to be loosened, while workarounds to access social media and independent news are widely used by Iranians. There are still challenges for US companies looking to Iran for business opportunities. For one thing, there are no direct banking relationships between Iranian and American banks. Sanctions lawyer Erich Ferrari says banks in America remain “over compliant” and often block legal, approved transactions. “[There is] an immense fear of the [US Department of the Treasury's] Office of Foreign Assets Control,” Ferrari said. Changing that culture could take time. Bijan Khajehpour noted that under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, commercial law and anti-corruption measures had weakened.  “Even if all the sanctions are lifted tomorrow, doing business in Iran is not going to be easy,” he said, “before Ahmadinejad we have under-the-table corruption, after Ahmadinejad we have over-the-table corruption.” He noted that while the current president, Hassan Rouhani, was committed to economic development and ending corruption, it was going to take time. The country has a poor human rights record, with hardliners in Tehran long supporting militant groups fighting the US and its allies, as well as promoting anti-Western rhetoric. Khajehpour said his advice to firms entering the market was to partner with domestic businesses, at least initially.  “There are a number of issues, but my statement on business risks and challenges is that all of them are manageable, if you take the right approach,” he said. For its part, Iran’s current regime is making a concerted push to attract foreign investment, promoting opportunities and offering tax brakes to lure investors. If the sanctions are lifted, former Ambassador Lewis noted, it could have significant global ramifications.  “[The] world’s largest reserves of gas suddenly become unfettered, and if I was sitting in Moscow I’d be worried about that,” he said, adding that, “the second largest reserves of rare earths could end Chinese dominance in rare earths.” Even if a deal isn’t reached, there is reason to believe that sanctions may be weakened.  Regional players such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have been working around the international sanctions, and America’s strained relationship with Russia may make Security Council cooperation on Iran increasingly difficult.  Tech expert Christopher Schroeder noted that sanctions were less intrusive now than when they were initially introduced. Schroeder claimed that sanctions on smartphones only recently being loosened, according to one significant investor, there could be up to 6.5 million iPhones already in the hands of Iranian consumers.  With sanctions losing their bite and significant political capital invested by both Rouhani and Obama, there is only increased pressure on each side to strike a deal before the November 24 deadline.

Reuters/ Eduardo MunozBill Ackman is still on top this year. Reuters reports that his hedge fund Pershing Square returned 1.4% in September, bringing its year to date return up to 31.5%. Ackman's most active positions include a big short of Herbalife, which fluctuates between losing him money and going flat; a stake in pharmaceutical company Allergan; and huge stakes in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — Pershing is the largest shareholder in both stocks.  Fannie and Freddie took a bath this week when a lawsuit to allow shareholders to share in the companies' profits ruled out of his favor — both stocks declined up to 40%. As for Allergan, we'll just have to wait to see how things shake out. Ackman has teamed up with another pharmaceutical company, Valeant, to take over the company. So far Allergan isn't biting.

REUTERS/Mike StoneStudents disembark from a school bus outside The Ivy Apartments, where a man diagnosed with the Ebola virus was staying in Dallas, Texas October 1, 2014.Stocks went nowhere on Thursday after dropping in morning trade European stocks fell sharply following the latest monetary policy announcement from the ECB. In morning trade, each of the major US averages was down more than 1%, but a rally through the afternoon sent the markets into the close little changed. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Thursday: 1. The biggest story on Thursday was Europe. The ECB announced its latest monetary policy decision, keeping interest rates unchanged, but the real action came during ECB president Mario Draghi's press conference. Draghi didn't give the amount of detail regarding the ECB's asset-backed security purchase program that the market was expecting. Draghi didn't give any detail as to the size of the potential asset purchases from the ECB, and European stocks paid the price, especially Italy, which saw shares fall more than 3.5% on Thursday.  2. The weekly report on initial jobless claims showed that claims fell last week to 287,000, better than the 297,000 that was expected by economists. Following the report, TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg said, "The ongoing decline in weekly jobless claims continues to suggest that labor market slack is on the decline, with the layoff side of the labor equation remaining on a path of gradual improvement as claims hover around cycle lows." 3. Warren Buffett appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday morning and announced a big move into the auto dealership space, announcing the acquisition of the Van Tuyl Group. Van Tuyl is the fifth-largest auto dealer operator in the US and has annual sales of about $9 billion. Buffett said this company would be in the Fortune 500 on its own, bringing the total number of would-be Fortune 500 companies under the Berkshire umbrella to 9.5. Buffett also talked about the Burger King deal, for which he is providing $3 billion in financing, and which he says is not being done for tax reasons.  4. GoPro shares fell more than 6% after the company's founder, Nick and Jill Woodman, announced that they would gift 5.8 million of their personal shares of the company to a charitable foundation. The move wasn't met kindly by investors as the Woodman's were forced to break the 180-day lock-up expiration that typically prevents company insiders from selling shares following an IPO. CNBC reported on Thursday afternoon, however, that the founders have no plans to sell shares and were moving the stock now simply for tax reasons.  5. Stocks in Argentina got crushed on Thursday, falling more than 8% after news that the country's central bank head Juan Carlos Fabrega resigned from his post. Thursday's loss in the Merval index followed a sharp drop on Wednesday, bringing the index's five-day losses to more than 13%.  6. Starboard Value, the hedge fund that issued a long presentation about Olive Garden a few weeks back, offered to buy the remaining shares of RealD it does not already own for $12.00. RealD makes 3D glasses and the technology that enables movie theaters to show movies in 3D.  7. On Thursday, a report from Bloomberg got comment from several of the 23 people who signed a letter to the Federal Reserve urging the central bank to stop quantitative easing programs, and all of the people reached by Bloomberg declined to concede that their call for massive inflation and dollar debasement has turned out to be wrong.  8. Friday is Jobs Day in America, and expectations are for the latest report from the BLS to show that nonfarm payrolls grew by 215,000 in September.

Flickr/stuart_spivackFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Asian Consumers Still Prefer Local Brands (AllianceBernstein)  Investors in big chains like Starbucks shouldn't automatically get excited when they announce plans to move into emerging markets. Asian consumers are proud of and still prefer "their distinct tastes and traditions." As a result, homegrown restaurant franchises and consumer companies "with a deep knowledge of local appetites" are legitimate competition to major international brands in Asia, argues AllianceBernstein's Liliana Castillo Dearth. This is especially true in Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines.  "We think that local companies have a leg up on their global competitors, thanks largely to their strong distribution networks. These are critical because these markets are highly fragmented, with significant parts of the population living in rural areas, where modern retail outlets such as supermarkets are rare." Although incomes are rising, local companies have developed such strong brand loyalty that consumers still prefer them. Even younger consumers who are more likely to go to "western" themed establishments, prefer "products that appeal to local tastes." "Catering to tastes of those consumers ... will be a tall order for competitors such as Starbucks," writes Dearth. There Are 5 Options For Clients Now That Rates For Long-Term Care Policies Have Risen (Financial Planning) Rates for long-term care policies have risen on average 4.8%, and some have increased by as much as 60% over the last year, according to Financial Planning. And there are several things that clients can do. Their gut reaction might be to cancel the policy, but financial advisors should remind clients that "even paying $500 in premium per year will probably cost less than the cheapest care available." Other clients may decide to let the policy lapse and then buy a new one. Although this sounds smart, the problem here is that if client have only had their policies for a year or two, then it will be difficult to find a better rate. If clients do drop their policy, advisors should tell them that most insurers will pay out benefits equal to the premiums paid. Advisors should recommend the following strategies to their clients instead. Some clients can pay the old premium with lost benefits — which is "better than nothing." Others can get reduced inflation protection for a lower premium. And finally, some might be able to pay the new higher premiums. ETFs Can Provide Extra Time As Investors Make Adjustments To Portfolios (BlackRock Blog) Investors who are unsure about their core bond holdings and are thinking about reallocating their funds should look at ETFs. The ETF will provide investors with a "bridge between your old investment and your new one, and preserves your market exposure along the way," writes BlackRock's Matthew Tucker. Investors can sell out of the old fund and then use proceeds to purchase an ETF with similar exposure. And when they eventually find a new manager, they can see the ETF. Tucker says that specifically the ETF should be used for this, rather than "any core fund." ETFs are the better choice because they "shield you from style drift." Plus they are traded on exchanges and their prices are available to all investors. This leads to lower transaction costs than trading directly. "In the case of the US Aggregate Bond (AGG), it has typically traded with a spread of about 2 basis point," adds Tucker. Wunderlich Securities Buys Its Rival Dominick &amp; Dominick LLC (The Wall Street Journal)  Memphis-based Wunderlich Securities, a full-service brokerage firm, has agreed to acquire its New York based rival Dominick &amp; Dominick LLC. This acquisition will expand the firm to 600 associates with $10 billion in client assets. Wunderlich was founded in 1996 has often grown its business by acquisitions. In 2007 it acquired Capital Securities of America and in 2012 bought three branches from Sanders Morris Harris Inc.  "The latest growth spurt has been partly helped by a $40 million capital injection from a group led by private-equity firm Altamont Capital Partners late last year," writes Michael Wursthorn.  Don't Shy Away From Out-Of-State Muni Bonds (Charles Schwab) Municipal bonds are one of the few investments that pay interest that are generally exempt from federal income taxes, but there are several taxes that could apply to muni bonds. Generally, if investors buy bonds from their home state they are exempt from state income taxes. "However, interest paid on bonds from outside of your home state is generally subject to state income tax", which will reduce the net income received from the bond. For those who live in a state with low tax rates (or one that issues a minimal amount of muni bonds), "we would suggest looking outside of your state. The added benefits of diversification and higher yields may make up for the hit you would take by paying state income taxes," write Cooper J. Howard and Rob Williams. FREE AppDownload
Megan Willett/Business InsiderDeep-fried green beans at MGM Grand's TAP Sports Bar.As spending in Las Vegas shifts from gaming to everything else, there's more and more reason to go to Sin City to eat. The city has always been a hotspot for foodies, with high-end options like Joël Robuchon, Guy Savoy, and Thomas Keller’s Bouchon Bistro, but it's really blowing up recently. More than 60 new restaurants have opened, been designed, or plan to open in Las Vegas, according to Travel &amp; Leisure. Many of these are affordable establishments with entrées in the $15-$30 range. Thanks to Vegas’ nearly 40 million annual tourists, the local restaurant industry rakes in an estimated $8 billion annually, according to Applied Analysis. The demand for great, attainable food is there, and the city has begun to deliver. Contrast this with a decade ago, when the Vegas culinary scene was an arms race for hotels on the Strip to acquire a five-star restaurant. “When I first came 10 years ago, we felt a sort of competition between the restaurants that were within the casinos to set up these quality restaurants,” Joël Robuchon told Business Insider. niallkennedy/FlickrThe exterior of Joël Robuchon in the Las Vegas MGM Grand Mansion.MGM Grand did ultimately open a Joël Robuchon, as well as Robuchon's L’Atelier, both of which now boast Michelin stars. For more ultra-high-end dining the Strip, the Bellagio has Picasso, a restaurant filled with works by the late artist, the Mandarin Oriental has highly-rated Twist, Aria has barMASA and Jean Georges Steakhouse, and Caesars Palace has Guy Savoy. The list goes on and on. If you want to break the bank to eat amazing food, Las Vegas has you covered. But whereas it used to be all about the fine dining, Vegas restaurants today are placing more value on quality food at affordable prices. Hotels now have sports bars, buffets, and sushi spots with ridiculously good food, and these places are mere doors away from the fine dining powerhouses that used to dominate the scene. Megan Willett/Business InsiderThe scene at Bellagio's Buffet, which can seat almost 600 people and has a huge selection.And then of course, there’s the true heart of the Las Vegas culinary scene, which has also seen a revamp: the buffets. From the huge selection at the Bellagio Buffet to the amazing food at the Cosmopolitan’s Wicked Spoon and the high-class fare at the Bellagio’s Jasmine, Vegas buffets are shaking their abysmal reputations.  There’s no doubt the food scene in Las Vegas will continue to get better as new restaurants open on the strip and add to the city’s burgeoning foodie culture. So the next time you’re in Sin City, skip the sinning and get right to the food. FREE AppDownload

HubSpotHubSpot employeesNext week, a Boston-based tech company called HubSpot plans to raise ~$100 million in an inital public offering on the New York stock exchange.  Hubspot is a software-as-a-service company, which means it makes software that companies subscribe to, rather than simply buy and install. The software it makes is marketing software for small to medium-sized business. Reports say Hubspot shares will go for $19 to $21 per share, resulting in a market cap of ~$600 million. We took a long look at HubSpot's S1, chatted with some sources familiar with the company's inner-workings, talked to a competitor, and spoke to analyst. There are a few things we learned about Hubspot that anyone considering investing in the company should know. In July, Hubspot's top two technical people quit the company. Hubspot's chief product officer, David Cancel, and vice president of engineering, Elias Torres, quit at the same time to go start a new company together. It's not a small loss. Cancel and Torres hired most of Hubspot's engineering staff. So far, none of those people have followed them out the door — but insiders expect that to change six months to a year from now. For what it's worth, the breakup seems to have been amicable; Cancel and Torres came into the company through the acquisition of their prior startup and they were never secret about their plans to someday go start another company. They decided to leave this summer before they got locked into Hubspot as company officers post-IPO. Hubspot management blew its relationship with Salesforce.com, costing themselves hundreds of millions of dollars and costing the company sales. A few years ago, $35 billion SaaS giant Salesforce invested in Hubspot. Soon, it was sending some of its customers Hubspot's way. Then, in early 2013, Salesforce approached Hubspot with an offer to buy the company for a price north of $1 billion. Hubspot management said no. Salesforce.com went with plan B and bought the parent company of a Hubspot competitor, Pardot. Now Salesforce is going to its customers it previously set up with Hubspot and offering them discounts to switch to Pardot. Meanwhile, Hubspot is looking to IPO at a price lower than Salesforce's offer a year and a half ago. Hubspot has higher than normal customer churn. In part because Hubspot sells to small and medium-sized business , it has a higher than normal customer churn rate. The number Hubspot cares more about, "subscription dollar retention rate" isn't much better. In 2013, the last full year reported in the company's IPO filing, it was 82.9%. That means 17% of 2012's subscription revenue dollars went away in 2013. This white paper from Bessemer Venture Partners says healthy SaaS companies keep their retention rate above 90%.  Hubspot's plan to reduce this revenue churn is to upsell its existing customers with new products. It just came out with new sales software for that purpose. It changed its pricing so that customers who use the product more, pay more. There is some evidence the plan is working. In Q2, subscription dollar retention rate was 90.3% year-over-year. Another silver-lining: Hubspot 12,000 customers. That's a lot compared to its closest rival, Marketo. That means Hubspot has a lot of upside if it can figure out how to upsell those customers. Hubspot's customer-acquisition costs keep rising. We're told it takes something like 20 to 24 months for a single Hubspot customer to generate enough revenues to pay for the marketing costs it took for that customer to be acquired.  Hubspot declined to comment on this story.

Thomson ReutersTo match Special Report PIMCO/GROSSNEW YORK (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co. had $25.5 billion of net outflows firm-wide across all of its U.S. open-ended funds in September, the bulk of which came out of its flagship fund, according to Morningstar data on Thursday. Morningstar estimated net outflow for the flagship Pimco Total Return Fund of $17.9 billion in September, compared with the Newport Beach, Calif.'s figure of $25.3 billion. Morningstar said the firm estimates open-end fund net flows by computing the change in assets from one month to the next that is not explained by the performance of the fund. "The fund’s actual flows may differ from  Morningstar’s estimates for a variety of reasons, including the timing of actual purchases and redemptions versus our assumptions and the timing and type of dividend distributions, for example."

In late 2008, oil and gas pipeline construction workers earned $0.46 per hour more than new home framing contractors. Today, they earn $8.15 more per hour. It's no wonder labor is tight in the new home market, especially in Texas and Denver, the closest major markets to North Dakota. Since 2008, framing contractor wages have fallen 8%, while oil and gas pipeline construction wages have swelled by 20%. John Burns Real Estate Consulting Since the end of 2007, oil and gas construction grew by 223,000 jobs, while residential construction employment fell by 743,000 jobs. That still means that there are at least 500,000 former construction workers not in the oil industry who need to be enticed to return to the residential construction market. Touring the Washington, DC, Charlotte, Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix housing markets recently, the triple-digit thermometer readings reminded me just how difficult home construction can be. We will be watching the inevitable wage increases carefully, as rising wages will have the additional impact of reducing the price home builders will pay for land. John Burns Real Estate Consulting Note: We are defining energy sector and residential construction as follows: Energy sector = oil and gas pipeline construction + oil and gas extraction + support activities for oil and gas operations Residential construction = residential building construction + residential specialty trade contractors FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersPeople walk inside JP Morgan headquarters in New York(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co denied a report in the New York Times on Thursday that its computer system had been breached for the second time in about three months. "The story is false. We are not aware of any new attack," JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an email. The New York Times DealBook column, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported that the biggest U.S. bank had found that hackers with links to Italy had gained entry to some of its servers. The attack was discovered recently, the newspaper said. The report of the second breach follows an attack discovered in late July, where hackers obtained entry to many of the bank's servers and reviewed information on more than one million customer accounts, the newspaper said.

CNAThe ship's route through the Northwest Passage The hazardous Northwest Passage is open for business. The MV Nunavik left Canada’s Deception Bay on September 19 and rounded Alaska’s Point Barrow on Tuesday – without an icebreaker escort. Owned by shipping firm Fednav and built in Japan, the Nunavik is the first cargo ship to make the trip unassisted, although technically, she is rated as a Polar Class 4 vessel, and can withstand year-round operations in first-year ice. FednavA picture of the NunavikThe Nunavik is carrying 23,000 tonnes of nickel concentrate extracted from the Chinese-owned Nunavik Nickel Mine near Deception Bay, Fednav said. The route to the port of Bayuquan, China, is about 40 per cent shorter than through the Panama Canal. Her successful voyage underlines the huge role global warming is playing in international trade. Two years ago, Arctic sea ice shrank to cover the smallest area ever recorded. That’s already affecting traffic through the Suez Canal. Russia believes the Northern Sea Route could become the prime passage between Europe and Asia. Traffic jumped from four vessels in 2010 to 71 in 2013 – the journey takes only 35 days, compared to a 48-day journey between the continents via the Suez Canal. It’s desperately trying to stake ownership over the passage along its Arctic coast and seeking to charge ships for using it. REUTERS/NASA/Terra Satellite/HandoutAn ice-free Northwest Passage is seen in this handout satellite photo from NASA taken on September 15, 2007.  Panama’s stranglehold on shipping is under threat for the first time in 100 years. Testing will begin mid next year on a new set of locks that will allow the world’s largest tankers to pass through, but the project is suffering cost overruns heading into the billions. And a Chinese businessman is serious about a $40bn plan to build a whole new canal through Nicaragua, which will be three times longer than the Panama route. According to reports, the Nicaraguans have green-lit the project and it’s aiming for a 2020 opening. Somewhat ironically, Fednav says through fuel savings, it expects to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions during MV Nunavik’s voyage by about 1,300 metric tons (1,430 tons) – the very thing allowing it to now take the shortcut. Adding to its green credentials, Fednav also said they consulted the World Wildlife Fund to find a route that causes the least impact on marine wildlife.

Rose Corr for Business InsiderOn Monday night about two dozen journalists, steak-enthusiasts and all-around hungry people gathered in a private room at Old Homestead Steakhouse in Manhattan's Meatpacking District to enjoy an experience months in the making. For the first time ever, Americans were about to dine on the highest quality Japanese Wagyu steak purchased at one of the country's exclusive beef auctions. Greg Sherry, a co-owner of Old Homestead along with his brother Marc, traveled to Japan's Gunma prefecture to bid on some beef and bring it back home. Rose Corr for Business Insider(Left to right) Marc and Greg Sherry, owners of Old Homestead "Marc and I always try to be the first in everything we do," Sherry told Business Insider. "Wagyu is something Marc and I brought to this country 18 years ago and we've just kept searching for the best of the best of the best." Indeed, in some meat-circles the Sherry brothers are known as 'The Ambassadors of Steak' for lobbying Japanese and American food regulators to get Wagyu to America in the first place. Eating the extra fatty steak has been a culinary experience for steak lovers across the country ever since. Wagyu is distinct because of the way the cattle is raised — and that is, slowly. Unlike your average 1,600 lbs American cattle, Wagyu cattle are not force fed or allowed to graze (all that running around builds too much muscle). They're also only brought up to about 1,300 lbs. The result is an incredibly fatty, tender meat that melts in your mouth like butter.  Steak butter. Think about that. Rose Corr for Business InsiderThe Old Homestead BQT Greg Sherry started the process of getting into the auction about 4 months ago. Once he was approved, he jetted over to Japan. It took about 45 days for the meat to get through customs after purchase. Once it got to the U.S., Marc Sherry went to work creating a tasting menu for the launch (yes, a meat launch). On Monday night guests dined on five courses including Wagyu tenderloin bites, a Wagyu chuck mini burger with quail egg and truffles (a BQT), Wagyu sirloin Carpaccio, a Wagyu rib steak, and homemade vanilla bean Wagyu ice cream. It was incredibly rich and incredibly incredible. It's also, of course, incredibly expensive. A 12 oz cut of Japanese steak will run you about $350 at Old Homestead. So save up.   FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersU.S. President Barack Obama speaks during his meeting with India's PM Narendra Modi at the White House in Washington WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the Obama administration clamped down last month on companies that reincorporate abroad to escape high U.S. taxes, it did not address a tax-dodging technique known as "earnings stripping," leaving some to wonder if it is the next target. Earnings stripping is widely practiced and covers a range of financial dealings that shrink the taxable U.S. profits of multinationals, including those that have moved their tax domiciles abroad in "inversion" deals and others. "I think there's still nervousness about what's going on here," said Michael Hirschfeld, a partner at law firm Dechert LLP and the immediate past chair of the American Bar Association's tax section. "What will they do with earnings stripping?" New rules unveiled by the U.S. Treasury Department on Sept. 22 targeted certain tax-avoidance strategies in an effort to stem a rising tide of deals in which a U.S. company buys out a smaller, foreign rival and then adopts its tax nationality. Inversions, as the deals are known, can put companies in position to strip earnings out of the United States. In its announcement, Treasury asked for public comments on other ways to "make inversions less economically appealing." Analysts interpreted the request as inviting ideas on how to confront earnings stripping. But there was no anti-earnings stripping component in Treasury's package of rules. Congressional aides and lobbyists said the administration was likely uncertain about its legal authority to tackle the practice and did not want to overreach. FBR Capital Markets downplayed the possibility of additional Treasury action in a research note to clients on Thursday. "We do not expect any additional notices or regulations from Treasury in the near future," said the Arlington, Virginia-based investment bank. The request for comment on earnings stripping "is likely intended to preserve a chilling effect rather than a foreshadowing of future regulations on the topic," FBR said. Businesses particularly fear action from Congress, which they said could ban even more tax practices that lawmakers oppose, said one mergers and acquisitions lawyer who was not authorized to speak to the media. Senators Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin, both Democrats, have proposed cracking down on earnings stripping. For inverted companies, the practice typically involves a foreign parent lending money to a U.S. unit, which sends U.S. profits back as partially U.S. tax-deductible interest. Schumer and Durbin propose reducing the deductions a company can claim to 25 percent from 50 percent of income, even for companies that inverted years ago, and ending a rule that lets less-leveraged companies avoid the deduction limits. But Congress is adjourned until after the Nov. 4 elections, and in the subsequent "lame duck" session before 2015 other issues are likely to occupy lawmakers' time. Tax lobbyists said they doubted lawmakers would pass inversion legislation unless something significant happens, like a major deal announcement. "I'm sort of a little bit dubious as to what Congress is going to do," Hirschfeld said.   (Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Douglas Royalty) FREE AppDownload
Sometimes, it just doesn't matter how strong a company's earnings prospects are. When volatility spikes in the financial markets, traders and investors will just dump everything. This is one of the more intuitive manifestations of behavioral biases in the stock market. RBC Capital Markets' Jonathan Golub shared this telling chart in his new 84-page Investment Strategy Playbook. It tracks the fluctuations of S&amp;P 500 pairwise correlations and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The correlations reflect the degree to which stocks move in the same direction with each other. The VIX is a rough reflection of fear and panic in the market. As you can see, spikes in the VIX coincide lead correlations. RBC Capital Markets FREE AppDownload
GettyMichael Kors shares have been tumbling this year.The Michael Kors brand might be past its prime.  The fashion label, which enjoyed a stunning rise in popularity in recent years, is facing new challenges to its business. Forbes announced this week that Michael Kors is no longer a billionaire because shares have declined 25% in six months. Here are a few big problems with the brand.  Widespread popularity is the "kiss of death for trendy fashion brands, particularly those positioned in the up-market younger consumer sectors," industry expert Robin Lewis writes on his blog. Lewis compares Michael Kors to Tommy Hilfiger, which reached its peak in the late '90s.  Michael Kors is considered an aspirational brand, with consumers paying a premium for its label. Once everyone has the product, it is no longer considered cool.  Other brands who have experienced this phenomenon include Juicy Couture, Jordache, and Coach.  Baird Equity ResearchGoogle searches for the brand are declining in the US. Michael Kors is entering the current quarter with a 65% inventory increase, writes retail equity analyst Marie Driscoll.  While the company says that the excess inventory is because of the company taking the e-commerce business in-house, Driscoll is skeptical that it will sell.   "That’s a lot of inventory in an increasingly competitive category," she writes. "I'm worried." She also compares Michael Kors to the Tommy Hilfiger collapse more than a decade ago.  "While the brand continues to enjoy vibrant demand, these investors are on to greener pastures," she says. "It’s probably time to sell KORS shares!" Yahoo! FinanceShares are down 25% in six months. Michael Kors has also has several brands at different price points, a strategy that could easily backfire, Lewis says. Kors has a high-end department store brand, a middle-market brand, and discount outlet stores.  "Some would argue all of those segments will simply end up competing with each other, thus cannibalizing the top end of the spectrum," he writes.  In other words, consumers won't pay $300 for a department store Michael Kors bag when they can get one at the outlet mall for half-price.  FREE AppDownload
Argentina's Merval stock index is down about 7% Thursday after taking an 8% beating Wednesday as well. The selling off is all likely due to Wednesday's news that the country's Central Bank head, Juan Carlos Fabrega, resigned from his post. The rumors that he was out started swirling around in the Argentine media Wednesday morning. Fabrega was in favor of negotiating with the group of hedge fund creditors whose lawsuit for over $1.3 billion in sovereign debt tipped the country into default at the end of July. Reports also indicated that he did not get along with Axel Kicillof, the Argentina economy minister who has a close relationship with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Fabrega was replaced by securities regulator Alejandro Vanoli. Check out the carnage below. Over the last 5 trading days, the Merval has fallen over 13%: Yahoo Finance Fabrega had helmed the Central Bank for only about a year. In that year, however, he oversaw a big devaluation of the peso (in January) and watched dollar reserves dwindle to dangerous lows of about $24 billion. Fearing an all too familiar economic crash, Argentines are sending dollars out of the country at a rapid rate, and Fernandez publicly blamed all of this on Fabrega on Tuesday night. "You blame me for the flight of capital and the rising dollar, that's fine," Fernandez said, speaking to Fabrega in the front row of her public speech. "I feel for the dollar losses and not another one should leave the country. Besides that, you continue to have a problem with the economy that I don't have to solve. Just be sure another dollar does not leave the country." But the country's problems were in the making before Fabrega's tenure, and they are beyond anything one central banker can fix. Low commodities prices have hit Argentina's exports hard, and its defaulted status is keeping investors cautious. Barclays estimates that if things go on like this, by this time next year Argentina's dollar reserves could be as low as $10 billion. Barclays FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersWilliam Dudley, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, speaks at Brooklyn College in the Brooklyn borough of New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - A broader definition of the benchmark Libor interest rate and a better alternative is needed, an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official said on Thursday, joining the chorus of world regulators calling for changes in the wake of abuse. New York Fed President William Dudley highlighted two key areas of concern: the need for a definition of the rate that better reflects observable funding patterns; and the need for an alternative reference rate that works for all participants and is based on a deeper cash market. "This combination, a more robust and resilient LIBOR for transactions that require a reference rate with a bank credit risk component and the development of an alternative reference rate for transactions like interest rate derivatives that don't, will strengthen our financial system and help undo some of the damage caused by earlier transgressions," Dudley said in prepared remarks that did not mention monetary policy. A critical tool in global markets, Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, is used in a large number of dollar-based contracts. It is also a reference rate for another $150 trillion in contracts denominated in other currencies and is common in financial derivatives. Confidence was shaken when it was disclosed that the banks whose daily rate estimates are used to set Libor had been manipulating the process for years. More than $6 billion in fines were levied as a result of the scandal. "More work needs to be done before confidence in these rates are put on a firmer foundation," said Dudley, whose branch of the U.S. central bank acts as its eyes and ears on Wall Street. Any solution will require appropriate incentives and controls at financial institutions, he added, largely backing the proposals raised by Fed Governor Jerome Powell a month ago. Libor is used to set the terms of consumer loans, home mortgages, corporate bonds and other widely used forms of credit. Since the abuse was uncovered, global regulators have revised the process for setting the rate.   (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersIMF Director Lagarde delivers her speech on the global economy ahead of the fall meetings of the IMF and World Bank at Georgetown University in WashingtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global economy could be stuck in a weak growth rut for a long time as countries struggle to pull free from a past of high debt and unemployment, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. The economic rebound is even weaker than the IMF predicted six months ago, and countries risk getting stuck in a prolonged period of sluggish growth, especially in the euro zone, Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, said. "Yes, there is a recovery but as we all know - and can all feel it - the level of growth and jobs is simply not good enough," Lagarde said in remarks at Georgetown University in Washington. "The world needs to aim higher and try harder." Lagarde said the IMF pared its expectations for potential growth, or the change in the global economy's ability to produce. In its last forecast in July, the IMF said the global economy should expand 3.4 percent this year, with growth speeding up to 4 percent in 2015. Lagarde, who spoke ahead of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings next week, chronicled a series of "clouds on the horizon" that could hurt the global economy, including central banks' differing plans to raise interest rates. Central banks in the United States, Japan, the euro zone and Britain have all sharply lowered rates to boost economic growth. But the United States and Britain are now considering "normalizing" their policies and starting to raise rates, which could prompt gyrations in foreign exchange rates, Lagarde said. "Moreover, the longer easy money policies continue, the greater the risk of fueling financial excess," she said. "This needs to be monitored and managed." The expectations of diverging monetary policies in the United States and the euro zone has already been seen in  foreign exchange markets. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. dollar against six major currencies, surged nearly 8 percent in the just-ended third quarter, its best quarterly performance in six years. On Thursday, however, the euro rose against the dollar for the first time in eight days. Lagarde warned that financial risks could emerge, as asset valuations in advanced economies have shot up while volatility stays low, and riskier transactions start to migrate to the shadow banking sector. Geopolitical risks could also derail the recovery, she said, pointing to turmoil in Ukraine, the Middle East and some parts of Asia, as well as the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa. She called on policymakers to do more to boost economic growth and create jobs, including reforming labor market policies, combating tax evasion and investing in infrastructure. "Our main job now is to help the global economy shift gears and overcome what has been so far a disappointing recovery: one that is brittle, uneven and beset by risk," Lagarde said. "It means a mix of bolder policies to inject a 'new momentum' that can overcome this 'new mediocre' that clouds the future."

YouTube/ScreenshotThe US government began giving subsidies to farmers during the 1930s to provide a crucial safety net to small farmers, but they have had some unintended consequences.  While their original goal was to protect family farms against poor growing seasons or price fluctuations, in effect they line the pockets of giant agribusinesses and keep produce prices high.  While some family farms receive subsidies, they disproportionately benefit corporate mega-farms, which are able to buy more land and dominate the market. As the Heritage Foundation has noted, about 75% of larger farms collect subsidies compared with 24% of relatively smaller farms. The massive amount of money that goes to larger farms, in turn, increases demands (and prices) for land and other resources small farmers need. Farmer Kevin Smith, the co-owner of upstate New York's Sycamore Farms, recently explained to us how farming subsidies actually kill the market: When the government subsidizes corn and grain in the Midwest, a farmer can afford to grow 10,000 acres of corn, no matter the demand. All of the corn is pre-contracted and supplemented on the back-end. It would make no sense for a small farmer to try to grow that much corn because you can't sell that much at market. There is only a fixed amount of materials like seeds and fertilizer in the market. As subsidized farms buy and buy materials (which they can because of the subsidies), resources get scarce and prices go up. The scarcity drives up the cost of materials, but it doesn't drive up market prices of produce.  According to Smith, the high cost of materials and the stagnant cost of produce make it difficult for small farms to survive, while making corporate agriculture more lucrative. The numbers bear that out.  In 1935, there were approximately 6.8 million farms in the US. By 2000, that number had plummeted to 2.2 million. Today, we're down to 2.1 million. Meanwhile, the highest income bracket for farms now accounts for 66.4% of US agricultural products sold, up from 47.5% in 2002.   FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Ruben SprichMarissa Mayer, Chief Executive Officer of Yahoo. As we noted last week, the activist investor who launched a campaign against Yahoo wants to combine the company's operations with AOL. The investor, Starboard, also tantalizingly suggested that this combination would leave AOL as the surviving company, not Yahoo. Now, thanks to CNBC's John Jannarone, we know how Starboard wants to effect this combination. Starboard wants to spin off Yahoo's core business and merge it with AOL's, leaving "Yahoo" as little more than a holding company that owns stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. This would allow Yahoo to avoid paying more taxes on its Alibaba gains. It would also allow the company (theoretically) to unlock the value of its Asian assets without violating the agreement it just made to not sell or transfer its Alibaba stake for a year. In this plan, the Alibaba stake would be staying put — it would be Yahoo's actual business that would be unloaded. To comply with US tax rules, the Yahoo holding company would have to retain a small operating business. So Yahoo would have to leave something behind. But among all of the businesses that Yahoo owns, there is almost certainly something that no longer fits well with the core. Meanwhile... Yahoo's core business would be spun into AOL, likely via AOL acquiring the Yahoo operations by issuing stock. Under US tax rules, Yahoo shareholders would have to end up owning the majority of the new company. But Yahoo's operations are considerably bigger than AOL's, so this wouldn't be a high hurdle to meet. Company names wouldn't be a deterrent: If the combined company preferred the "Yahoo" name, AOL could change its name to "Yahoo" and Yahoo could change its name to "Huge Asset Holding Company Formerly Known As Yahoo" or something more mellifluous. What would be a question would be which management team would lead the combined company. Yahoo's management team? AOL's management team? Or a combination of the two? And where would the headquarters be located? FREE AppDownload
via Stribling & AssociatesPoor Abramovich.The gorgeous Fifth Avenue mansion that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich almost bought for $75 million is now available to rent for $150,000 a month, according to The Real Deal. Almost a year ago, Abramovich was in contract to purchase three of the five apartments in the building at 828 Fifth Avenue from the family of late British real estate developer Howard Ronson, which included the penthouse, a triplex, and a duplex apartment. The deal fell through after the seller — Ronson's widow, heiress Engelika Ivanc — reportedly held out because she thought she could get more money from the Russian mogul. Abramovich had reportedly bought another apartment in the building, and was trying to purchase the final unit so he could restore the mansion to its former glory. Now it looks like that dream may never happen. But for those with $150,000 to throw around each month, the eight-bedroom co-op is now available to rent on Stribling &amp; Associates. An interesting mix of classic and modern with tall ceilings and eight bedrooms, the home even has a rooftop terrace that looks out over Central Park.
Via Wikimedia CommonsWant to work in finance? LinkedIn has ranked the best universities in the United States for you to attend.  The professional social network used an innovative method to come up with the ranking. It found people on the website who listed themselves as working in finance, broke that down by the university he or she attended, and ranked each university in terms of how "desirable" the jobs that their alumni had.  The LinkedIn researchers explain their methodology: "We start with identifying desirable companies for each profession. We let the career choices of our members tell us how desirable it is to work at a company... Since not every graduate is interested in the same profession, it is only fair to define the relevant graduates as those who end up working in that career. For example, while ranking a school for the category ‘Investment Bankers’, we only consider graduates from that school who work as investment bankers."  Below are the top 25 schools for the whole financial profession. The top 25 for investment bankers — which is very similar to the list below — can be found here.  FREE AppDownload

In the wake of Bill Gross' shock departure, Paul Krugman has been hammering on an important point, which is that PIMCO really started hitting the rocks when Bill Gross made a wrong call about interest rates in 2011. Paul Krugman has written four posts on the topic (here, here, here, and here). So what's it all about? Well here's the quick and dirty version. In early 2011, Bill Gross completely exited the Treasury market on the premise that interest rates were going to surge and hit bonds.  He thought interest rates were going to surge because the Fed was ending QE2 in the summer of 2011. In a note written to investors in March 2011, he asked: Who will buy Treasuries when the Fed doesn’t? The thinking was that the federal government was running gigantic, trillion-dollar deficits at the time that nobody wanted and that it was only the Fed buying debt, holding our interest rates down. That sounded compelling but was actually pretty flimsy, and even at the time people were criticizing the thinking. Krugman was one of those people, arguing that interest rates weren't a function of how much debt the US was offering, but rather about US growth and inflation prospects. And because we were digging ourselves out of a gigantic economic hole at the time, there was no chance of a pickup in inflation.  So Gross was using a flawed economic model (as were the deficit hawks who insisted that the US had to get its spending down to avoid a Greece-like bond spiral). When QE2 ended, interest rates didn't rise — they actually fell, perhaps because the markets interpreted the end of Fed easing as a reason to bet against rising inflation or growth. This was THE core economic debate of the post-crisis years. The economists like Krugman, who relied on traditional models, correctly surmised that interest rates would not surge and that the debt would not be a problem. Folks like Bill Gross (and Republican politicians) thought the Fed was distorting the market and keeping interest rates from surging, and that turned out to be wrong. And that led to a period of underperformance for PIMCO and the start of the turmoil that saw significant outflows and ultimately the departure of Mohamed El-Erian and then Gross. These debates mostly aren't talked about now, but as stated above, this was really the whole story back in the day. And it ended up costing Gross his role in the company he created. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersWayfair co-chairman and co-founder Conine rings a ceremonial bell in front of fellow co-chairman and co-founder Shah to mark the company's IPO on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange(Reuters) - Wayfair Inc's  shares rose as much as 27 percent in their market debut on Thursday, valuing the online home furnishings retailer at about $3.06 billion. The company's debut comes after the blockbuster listing of Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  in New York and the strong debut of Europe's largest online fashion retailer Zalando SE  in Frankfurt. Boston-based Wayfair operates websites such as jossandmain.com, dwellstudio.com and birchlane.com, offering more than 7 million products under its own brands. The U.S. home goods market is expected to grow to $297 billion by 2023 from about $233 billion last year, Wayfair said in a regulatory filing. Online retailers accounted for about 7 percent of this, the company said. Wayfair competes mainly with Williams-Sonoma Inc , the operator of potterybarn.com and PBteen.com. It also competes with brick and mortar retailers such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc , Lowe's Cos Inc  and Target Corp  as well as online sellers including Amazon.com Inc  and eBay Inc . Wayfair's offering of 11 million class A common shares raised about $319 million. The company sold 10.5 million shares in the offering, which was priced at $29 per share, above the expected range of $25-$28. Wayfair, previously called CSN Stores LLC, was founded in 2002 as an online seller of furniture. At the time, the company retailed its items through hundreds of product-specific websites including bedroomfurniture.com and allbarstools.com. In 2011, it consolidated its operations and changed its name. Private equity firm Great Hill Partners holds a 11.04 percent stake in Wayfair, with private equity firms Battery Ventures and HarbourVest Partners being its other shareholders. Wayfair's revenue rose 52 percent to $915.8 million in 2013. The company's net loss narrowed to $15.5 million from about $21 million a year earlier. The company's shares were up 22.9 percent at $35.65 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock opened at $36 and hit a high of $37. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are the lead underwriters for the offering.  (Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti Pandey) FREE AppDownload

In late September, we highlighted what Albert Edwards at Societe Generale saw as the most important chart for investors. Well, now there is a second-most important chart. In a note to clients on Thursday, Edwards highlighted the recent decline in US inflation expectations.  Societe Generale This chart shows 5- and 10-year US "breakevens," which are calculated by taking the yield on the 5- and 10-year bond and subtract the yield on TIPS, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which are bonds that pay investors based on the inflation rate. Basically, declining "breakevens" indicate that the market expects inflation to remain low in the future.  Edwards says the importance of this chart is that it brings his "Ice Age" thesis back into play.  Edwards writes that his "Ice Age" thesis has two key parts: that the West will drift closer to outright deflation the way Japan has, and that with each central bank-powered recovery in asset prices investors will assume, "with child-like innocence, that central banks have somehow 'fixed' the problem." "Investors are beginning to see how impotent the Fed and ECB<U+0092>s efforts are to prevent deflation," Edwards writes. "And as the scales lift from their eyes, equity, credit and other risk assets trading at extraordinary high valuations will take their next giant Ice Age stride towards the final denouement... The upbeat economist community may indeed be right in the months ahead, but the markets are tiring of these promises and beginning to worry that if inflation can'<U+0092>t regain higher ground in this cyclical recovery, what on earth will happen when the cyclical upswing ends? They are only now beginning to embrace the notion that we are only one recession away from outright, Japanese-style, profit-crushing deflation."  We will be on the lookout for Edwards' third-most important chart.

YouTube He talked about the value of practice. "I've found that when I've done my best work as an actor it was only after I pushed myself to be better than I ever thought I could be. And I have a pretty high idea of how good I can be," he said. "Some of you may play because you love football. Some of you may play for your grandmother.

ReutersIn a speech earlier this week the President of Argentina struck an ominous tone, telling her people that if anything happens to her they should "look to the north." Argentine newspaper Clarin reported that U.S. intelligence picked up ISIS threats against the President. She brushed those off in disbelief (she has been at odds with Clarin before). "Please, listen, if something happens to me, and I say this very seriously, if something happens to me do not look to the Middle East. Look to the North... because after seeing the things that they're diplomatic representatives are doing, after hearing these declarations that honestly seem like exercises in cyniscm, after seeing the things I've seen in the United Nations, it seems they'd want us to believe an entire story that ISIS is coming for me to kill me or to do something — oh please, do not create some novela." In recent days the United States Embassy in Argentina released a warning to U.S. citizens in the country. Based on threats to the Embassy itself, the report recommended that Americans “always be aware of their surroundings and maintain a high level of vigilance”. President Fernandez called this report a "provocation." Argentina was declared in default at the end of July after losing a U.S. Court case against hedge fund creditors led by billionaire Paul Singer. The creditors want Argentina to pay over $1.3 billion worth of sovereign debt dating back to the country's last financial meltdown in 2001. The country has refused to pay, however, because these creditors refused to take a haircut on that debt like over 95% of investors. Argentina has appealed to the U.S. government to intervene, and indeed it has before in cases like this. President Bush asked Paul Singer to heel when he was going after sovereign debt the Congo owed his hedge fund back in the day. However neither the executive or legislative branches of the U.S. government have gotten involved with the case, and the fight rages on — most recently with U.S. Judge Tom Griesa finding Argentina in contempt earlier this week.

Screenshot via TwitterWhat's in Tesla's black garage?Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Wednesday night about something called "D," which will be officially unveiled October 9.  The photo that accompanied the tweet was of a partially opened garage door, with what looks a lot like a Tesla Model S peeking out. Everything was in black. Mysterious! Musk also said that in addition to "D," Tesla will pull the cover off "something else." So what's coming from the electric-car startup, which could actually use some good news as its stock has declined over the past several weeks (it was down almost 20% from a trading peak of $291 on Sept. 4 — but it's on the rise Thursday morning)? Screenshot via Twitter An All-Wheel-Drive Version of the Model S This is almost certainly what's in Tesla's Black Garage. An AWD version of the Model S has been rumored since the beginning of the year, and now that the company's Fremont, Calif., factory has been retooled to build the Model X SUV (arriving next year), the technology is in place to construct an AWD Model S. All-wheel-drive is an important variant in luxury cars — AWD offers more stable driving dynamics than rear-wheel-drive and is obviously better in bad weather. The Model S is currently available only with rear-wheel drive, tricky in the snow, and Tesla isn't invested in only selling cars in sunny California. The Model X will come what what Tesla has labeled a "dual motor" AWD system, so that's where the "D" comes in. This was my guess when I spotted Musk's tweet, and speculation has been widespread on the Internet that's "D" indeed means "dual." Explanation: The Model S "D" will need two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the back. High-Performance Model S? The existing Model S is already pretty snappy, but it's also pitched at buyers who love tech, love the Tesla story, and love the planet — more than they love going very fast in a straight line or around corners. The skunkworks nature of the photo in the tweet suggests that Tesla could be starting its own high-performance division, maybe aimed at racing. Mercedes has AMG, BMW has M Sport, Audi has S models. This is something that Tesla lacks and that would add a bit of dash to the company's story. And there's now a new electric-car racing series, Formula E. Presto, Elon Musk becomes Silicon Valley's Enzo Ferrari — on the weekends! My money is on this one! It's a Diesel Hahaha! But seriously, maybe Tesla has decided to deal with "range anxiety" by incorporating a diesel-electric hybrid engine into its designs, perhaps as a result of the company's relationship with Daimler (Germans love diesels!). Of course, a diesel-hybrid Model S — or any diesel-hybrid Tesla — would run 100% counter to what the company stands for: 100% all-electric transportation. Autoblog's Noah Joseph also suggests this possibility. It's the SpaceX Mars Rover Okay, probably not. It's A Model S That Runs Entirely On D Batteries This is Tesla's new battery-swapping plan. It will take several days to replace the Model S's existing lithium-ion battery pack with perhaps thousands of D batteries, but D batteries are pretty easy to find and you don't need to build a $5-billion Gigafactory to get them. It Stands For "Debt" Tesla doesn't currently have its own finance arm — if you want to to take out a loan to buy a Model S, you have to go through Wells Fargo or US Bank. I once asked Musk if Tesla was interested in becoming its own bank at some point — which makes sense if Tesla matures as a carmaker, given that it can make a lot of money through what's called "captive financing," especially if it can sell directly to the consumer at its stores — but he scoffed at the idea. That was a couple of years ago, however. Convertible? This theory is making the rounds as well. But it would imply that there will be a coupe version of the Model S, as well. Not a crazy idea. But some of this stuff is limited by the fact that Tesla doesn't really have enough production lines to build numerous variants of its cars. An Updated Roadster The Roadster was Tesla's first car, with components supplied by Lotus (although not, according to what Tesla's called a "myth," entirely by Lotus). It would be kind of good if Tesla could keep the Roadster going in some form, simply to have a sportier model in the lineup. But then again, the Roadster was more of a means to and end, and a sexy proof-of-concept for Tesla's electric-car business model. Driverless Tesla? Musk has said that all Tesla's will have self-driving capability in a few years, so maybe. But it doesn't really fit with the whole "black garage" thing. What about the "something else?"  I'm guessing it's a smartwatch. FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsThis is the Bunyan Muffler Man, named after Paul Bunyan. You can find it in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.Everyone's always talking about the insanely high rents in the New York City and San Francisco housing markets. But that doesn't mean people with money should scoop up a 5th Avenue condo and rent it out. Landlords seeking returns need to consider the difference between the cost of the property and the rent they can potentially bring in. A report by RealtyTrac found that the average returns were actually the highest in high-risk markets, where unemployment and vacancy rates are higher than national averages. RealtyTrac ranked these US housing markets based on gross rental yield, which is "the average fair market rent of three-bedroom homes in each county, annualized, and divided by the median sales price of residential properties in the third quarter." Although rents are high in New York and San Francisco, the property prices are also high, which means that returns are low. On the other side, these smaller markets have low property prices but relatively high rents — which means that returns are high. FREE AppDownload
Luc Gnago / ReutersA student holds a sign after a performance by actors during an awareness campaign against Ebola at Anono school in Abidjan September 25, 2014.Since March 2014, over 3,000 people have died from the relentless spread of the Ebola virus throughout the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Despite the heroic efforts of the humanitarian and medical professionals in these countries, crumbling public health systems—which were notoriously weak even before the current outbreak began—and a lack of facilities, equipment and medical staff have tragically not been able to stem the tide in these countries. Distrust of the government—fueled by decades of civil war—has also prompted attacks on health workers by fearful groups, further undercutting crucial outreach and educational interventions aimed at sensitizing communities to the virus and breaking the chain of transmission. Before the Ebola outbreak intensified, these countries were making remarkable economic progress—particularly Sierra Leone and Liberia, which experienced rapid economic growth in recent years after overcoming decades of civil strife. In 2013, Sierra Leone and Liberia ranked second and sixth among the top 10 countries with the highest GDP growth in the world (albeit their base levels of GDP are very small to begin with). Guinea, while growing more slowly at 2.5 percent in 2013, had high expectations for growth resting on its Simandou iron ore project, on to which international investors Chinalco, Rio Tinto, and the International Finance Corporation have signed. However, the iron mining sectors in these countries have been hit both by declining prices and the Ebola outbreak, calling into question the expected profitability of these projects, hurting investor confidence in the region and hindering contributions to future growth. At the beginning of the year, the International Monetary Fund forecasted that GDP growth in 2014 would amount to 11.3 percent, 5.9 percent and 4.5 percent for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, respectively. In mid-August, as a result of these factors, the IMF revised these estimates to 8.0 percent, 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, accordingly. In addition to the enormous and tragic loss of human life, the Ebola epidemic is having devastating effects on these West African economies in a variety of essential sectors by halting trade, hurting agriculture and scaring investors. Mobility restrictions, trade and transport: To halt the spread of the virus, the countries most affected by Ebola have implemented quarantines in areas where risk of infection is high while neighboring countries such as Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal have imposed restrictions on the movement of people and goods, including border closures. These measures, in turn, have reduced internal and regional trade, transport and, of course, tourism. But since official trade statistics do not capture informal trade—including cross-border trade which could range from 20 to 75 percent of GDP for West African countries—the estimated impact proposed by the World Bank may overlook the large reduction in informal trade due to mobility constraints. While these actions aim to break the chain of transmission, the president of Sierra Leone has called them an “economic blockade” that has resulted in scaled-back production and revenues for the government. Leon Neal/ReutersEdward Turay, Sierra Leone's High Commissioner to Britain, attends the "Defeating Ebola: Sierra Leone" conference in central London, on October 2, 2014.Agriculture: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agriculture accounts for 57 percent of Sierra Leone’s GDP, 39 percent of Liberia’s, 20 percent of Guinea’s, and 22 percent of Nigeria’s. Disruptions from the outbreak during the planting season earlier this year are expected to diminish yields for the staple crops of rice and maize during the harvest season, between October and December. Already, the price of the staple crop cassava in some places in Liberia has more than doubled (increased by 150 percent) according to the FAO. Food price shocks such as these will likely lead to inflation: According to IMF estimates, in Liberia the inflation rate will climb to 13.1 percent in 2014 from 7.7 percent before the Ebola crisis first broke. Mining and investment: Mining activity (which constitutes 14 percent of Liberia’s economy and approximately 17 percent of Sierra Leone’s) is decreasing in Liberia and Sierra Leone following restrictions on non-essential travel and repatriation of personnel. Voice of America reports that investor confidence has dropped since the escalation of Ebola cases. China Union and Arcelor Mittal are scaling down iron ore mining operations in Liberia. Some miners in Sierra Leone and Liberia are afraid to enter high-risk districts, and several firms (including Australian mining firm Tawana Resources and Canadian Oversea Petroleum) have suspended operations or sent foreign workers home. Investments may be postponed and even cancelled if the perceived risks are too great. Guinea, for now, is not experiencing a major impact on its mining sector since its main mines are not located in the areas where there is a high risk of infection. Fiscal challenges: Fiscal revenues will decline as limited economic activity reduces revenues from taxes, tariffs and customs duties. At the same time, to resolve the crisis and meet the greater health and security needs of their people, government expenditures will need to rise. Avoiding the impact on the poorest and most vulnerable will also necessitate more transfers. As seen in Figure 1, the World Bank reports that “short-term fiscal impacts are also large, at $93 million for Liberia (4.7 percent of GDP); $79 million for Sierra Leone (1.8 percent of GDP); and $120 million for Guinea (1.8 percent of GDP).”   The financial sector: Although the financial sector has largely been excluded from the narrative of the outbreak, it is worth noting that if large depositors withdraw funds, banks may face serious liquidity problems. Also, if some big creditors miss payments, the number of nonperforming loans will increase, eventually leading to some defaults. So liquidity management must also be a priority and banks’ bad loans portfolio need to be monitored carefully. Ultimately, loss of confidence in the financial system is the main risk factor and should be avoided. Finally, capital flight is an additional risk to the financial system especially as exchange rates have become more volatile. The World Bank reports that many wealthier Guineans and expatriates have already left the country and that uncertainty and risk aversion in Sierra Leone has prompted a rise in capital outflows. Tourism: Airlines such as British Airways, Emirates, Air France, Asky Airlines and Arik Air have implemented some bans on flights to and from the most affected countries. The African Union has asked for these bans to be lifted and also for proper screening mechanisms to be put in place at airports. CEOs of 11 firms operating in West Africa have said that some measures, including these travel restrictions, are doing more harm than good and may well be contributing to the humanitarian crisis by blocking crucial trade flows, thereby pushing up the prices of essential foods and medicines. There are also some concerns that an indirect consequence of the Ebola outbreak will be diminished tourism throughout the African continent: As seen in another recent Africa in Focus blog, the Ebola outbreak has been dominating headlines in the U.S., African and international press since early August, even overshadowing the Africa Leaders Summit. Misconceptions about the transmission of Ebola and the risk of travel in Africa may further reduce tourism to and within the continent. What is striking about the Ebola outbreak’s effects on the economies of West Africa is that the most influential factor constraining economic activity there is fear. As stressed by the World Bank, “the largest economic effects of the crisis are not as a result of the direct costs (mortality, morbidity, caregiving, and associated losses to working days) but rather those resulting from aversion behavior driven by fear of contagion. This in turn leads to a fear of association with others and reduces labor force participation, closes places of employment, disrupts transportation, and motivates some government and private decision-makers to close sea ports and airports.” The World Bank also notes that behavioral effects were responsible for as much as 80 to 90 percent of the total economic impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2004 and the H1N1 flu epidemic of 2009. As the current epidemic continues to unfold, the World Bank estimates that economic activity could be drastically affected in both the short and medium term, depending on whether the outbreak is swiftly contained (a “Low Ebola” scenario) or the outbreak continues to spread apace (a “High Ebola” scenario) (Figure 2).   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently predicted that if the virus continues to spread at current rates, more than 1.4 million people will be infected before the outbreak is contained.  But this prediction is a worst-case scenario that does not take into account recent efforts by the international community to stem the spread of the disease. It is, however, a stark reminder of the possible exponential transmission rate of the disease if the collective response to the Ebola threat is not fast and effective. The U.N. has stated that $1 billion is needed to contain the Ebola outbreak, while the World Bank has estimated that containment and mitigation would require several billion dollars for humanitarian support, fiscal support, screening facilities at airports and seaports, and for strengthening the surveillance, detection and treatment capacity of health systems. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of building new medical facilities, improving home care treatment (including training thousands of health care workers), and implementing broad-based, effective public information campaigns. Although the CDC projected a sobering, worst-case scenario of 1.4 million cases of Ebola by January 2015 (from the 6,000 cases at the moment), it did not take into account the planned interventions by the international community—and recently, commitments to intervene have been made on a large scale. International donors such as the World Bank and IMF have pledged to provide over $400 million and $130 million in financing (respectively) toward emergency response and medium- and long-term recovery in the most-affected countries. The U.S. has provided a surge of $175 million and 3,000 troops to help train nurses and establish emergency treatment facilities in Liberia. China has committed 174 doctors to Sierra Leone and $37 million in assistance to West Africa. Cuba has also pledged to provide the largest team of medical professionals of any country to assist the region, with 165 doctors set to arrive in Sierra Leone in October and an additional 296 heading to Guinea and Liberia. African countries have made contributions in the fight against Ebola as well; for example, under the U.N. Mission for Emergency Ebola Response, Ghana will serve as a logistical and training hub for medical professionals in the region. Senegal is also helping set up an “air corridor” to facilitate the transportation of medical personnel to Ghana. Through the African Union Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA) mission, Uganda—a country that has dealt with Ebola crises in the past—has pledged 25 medical experts to advise regional efforts, as has the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has given approximately $1 million to reinforce preventative measures aimed at stemming the spread of Ebola throughout West Africa. In addition, South Africa has established an Ebola diagnostics lab in Sierra Leone. While these commitments from international and regional donors show great promise to mitigate this crisis, only about one-third of the total $988 million requested by the U.N. has been pledged as of September 24, 2014. Nevertheless, the considerable support from African countries and institutions, as well as the international community, highlights the growing recognition that Ebola is not a West African problem. It is not an African problem. It is a global problem that needs to be addressed at all levels (national, regional and international) as swiftly and completely as possible. In this sense, it is important to coordinate a united African and global response in the short term, but also consider how to integrate investment in health systems into regional development plans in the medium to long term so that public health crises like the current Ebola outbreak can be addressed more quickly (or averted entirely) in the future. The good news is that the people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are resilient and have surmounted terrible civil strife before, managing to establish new heights of political and macroeconomic stability in recent years. The same strength that allowed them to endure and rebuild from past devastating conflicts, in conjunction with international support, will help them overcome the Ebola outbreak now. FREE AppDownload
Henry Blodget, Business Insider One of the most infuriating things about the Fed haters — i.e. the people who predicted massive inflation and dollar debasement as a result of quantitative easing — is that they've never really admitted they got it all wrong. Maybe a few have, but for the most part, the people predicting doom and gloom and Weimar Germany-like outcomes continue to say the same thing, without regard for actual evidence. This is what makes folks like Paul Krugman so infuriated and why he is so harsh toward his critics, because he regards them as intellectually dishonest. There's more evidence of that Thursday, courtesy of a great Bloomberg piece by Caleb Melby, Laura Marcinek, and Danielle Burger in which they called up various signatories to a 2010 letter that warned former Fed chair Ben Bernanke about impending inflation. The upshot: For the most part, they don't accept they were wrong. Here for example is Jim Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and an intense critic of Fed easing: Jim Grant, publisher of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, in a phone interview: “People say, you guys are all wrong because you predicted inflation and it hasn’t happened. I think there’s plenty of inflation — not at the checkout counter, necessarily, but on Wall Street. “The S&amp;P 500 might be covering its fixed charges better, it might be earning more Ebitda, but that’s at the expense of other things, including the people who saved all their lives and are now earning nothing on their savings. “That to me is the principal distortion, is the distortion of the credit markets. The central bankers have in deeds, if not exactly in words — although I think there have been some words as well — have prodded people into riskier assets than they would have had to purchase in the absence of these great gusts of credit creation from the central banks. It’s the question of suitability.” Grant is not 100% wrong in his concerns about the recovery. It has been disappointing. But a rising stock market is not how people measure inflation, and the labor market has recovered significantly, bringing real relief to millions of people. It is true that it hasn't been a great time to be a saver who has been 100% in cash, but if you've been in stocks (or even bonds!) you've done quite well. And here's Niall Ferguson also trying to claim credit: “Though generally regarded by a cause for celebration (even by those commentators who otherwise lament increasing inequality), this bull market has been accompanied by significant financial market distortions, just as we foresaw.” Sorry, but no. "Distortions, just as we foresaw," is at worst wrong, and at best tautological, in the sense that you can define distortions in any way you want, relative to any baseline that you have imagined in your head. Has the recovery been disappointing? Yes. Are there things the government and the Fed could have done differently to make the recovery better? Certainly. Have the Fed haters gotten things right? Not even close. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachThe European Central Bank's plan to reinvigorate the flagging eurozone economy just got a big boost — though you might easily have missed it. Hidden away in an Annex to the press release sent after Mario Draghi's press conference today, in which the ECB president was very light on the details of the new asset purchase program, is a key passage that will give people hope that his latest plan — which hopes to get money moving to Europe's struggling small companies — might actually have some impact. Here is the innocuous looking bullet-point that might just make all the difference: ECBThat sounds like vague banker-speak gobbledygook, but it's crucial: "Retained securities" are the assets held by banks in exchange for the ECB’s cheap loans. Without those assets the total value of remaining eurozone small and medium-sized enterprises' asset-backed securities would be too small for the ECB to make a meaningful difference to the region's economic prospects. Here is a chart from Gareth Davies, managing director of international ABS and covered bond research at JP Morgan, showing that without those "retained securities" the other available assets are just too small to make a meaningful difference to credit-starved companies. J.P. Morgan/Gareth DaviesDavies said in an email to Business Insider: I still think supply constraints exist in terms of the current outstanding stock (secondary) and flow (primary market) sizes. The way the ECB can however get access to size in the ABS space is through the purchase of previously structured and retained deals currently used as collateral at the ECB’s short-term MROs (along with covered bond purchases). There is currently around €726 billion of retained ABS , of which €699 billion is consumer ABS, RMBS and SME ABS. Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Crédit Agricole, says in a note that of this some €300 billion is eurozone collateral that would fall under the ECB's scope — a substantially larger market than would have been available if retained securities had not been included.  This will raise hopes that Draghi's plan might actually work. Even more interestingly, Draghi suggested that the ECB Governing Council were unanimous in their support for using further extraordinary measures if the situation were to deteriorate further. This, coupled with the inclusion of retained securities in the asset purchase program, strongly suggests that he has been successful in extracting concessions from those who were resisting further central bank action — with Germany's Bundesbank chief among them. Earlier this week Hans-Werner Sinn, German economist and president of the influential Ifo Institute for Economic Research, argued in the Financial Times that: [The ABS program] is nothing less than a fiscal bailout — something the ECB has no right to undertake, as the German constitutional court implied when it declared OMT unlawful. Although we don't yet have anything close to the full details of the ECB's plan, what we know strongly suggests that voices like Sinn's have been effectively silenced — at least for the moment.

All but one of the top 10 countries are in Western Europe, North America and Australasia, with Japan the exception at ninth place, according to the ranking which comprises 91 percent of the global population over the age of 60.  Norway tops the index, pushing last year's number one Sweden into second place in the second year the index has been released. Unsurprisingly, African countries make up half of the lowest quarter of the index, although Venezuela, Turkey and Serbia are ranked 76th, 77th and 74th respectively. HelpAge International, the charity which compiled the list, said economic growth in itself was not enough to improve the lives of older people. "Specific policies need to be put in place to address the implications of ageing," said the report, published on the United Nations International Day of Older Persons.  "Policies on income security in Mexico (30) have lifted it 26 places in the overall rankings since last year despite being less wealthy than Turkey (77)." The index is based on 13 indicators grouped into four areas: income security; health status; capability, which includes employment and educational status; and the enabling environment, including issues such as physical safety. Some countries fare better than others in different areas. Japan tops the rankings when it comes to health, while Switzerland has the best environment for older people.  This year's report focuses particularly on income security, namely pensions, which older people consistently identify as their top priority to fend off the risk of poverty. With rising numbers of old people -- two billion over the age of 60 by 2050, a similar number as children under 15 -- HelpAge International chief Toby Porter said pensions were vital for all governments. "Incomes are often too low to save for old age, which is why there's such a need for a basic social pension now," he said. In low and middle-income countries, only one in four people over 65 receive a pension while worldwide, half of the global population do not have a pension, the report said. But it applauds an "explosion" of new tax-financed, non-contributory pensions over the past two decades, which provide regular income for the very poorest. Across Latin America, countries have "dramatically extended coverage" of social pensions, helping push them up the global rankings. This reflects a global trend that saw China introduce a rural social pension in 2009, reaching 133 million more people, and Nepal and Thailand follow a similar route. "In most European Union countries, pensions systems as a whole do more to reduce inequality than all other parts of the tax or benefit system combined," said Porter. The top 10 in the index are: Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Iceland, United States, Japan and New Zealand. The bottom 10 are: Iraq, Zambia, Uganda, Jordan, Pakistan, Tanzania, Malawi, West Bank and Gaza, Mozambique and Afghanistan. FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, the Omaha businessman said: “I made a mistake on Tesco. That was a huge mistake by me.” Buffett is Tesco's fourth-biggest shareholder since he started buying the supermarket's shares in 2007. In 2013, he owned 301 million shares, about 3.7% of the company, the FT reported. According CNBC, Buffett has lost more than $700 million on his investment.  Tesco is struggling to compete with other discounts retailers like Aldi and Lidl, and its shares are at an 11-year low. The share price dropped by 49% this year and received a further blow last month when the retailer announced it had overstated its profits by 250 million pounds.  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersWorkers assemble built-in appliances at the Whirlpool manufacturing plant in ClevelandWASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods posted their biggest decline on record in August, payback for an aircraft-driven jump a month earlier. The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods dropped 10.1 percent. That was the largest drop in records going back to 1992. Stripping out transportation orders which were depressed bya plunge in the volatile aircraft component, new orders were down a more modest 0.1 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast total new orders received by factories would decline 9.3 percent. The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to expand, although growth may be moderating. The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that its gauge of factory activity showed slower growth in September. In August, orders for transportation equipment dropped 42.2 percent, a development already made clear in the government's report on durable goods orders released on Sept 25. In July, aircraft manufacturer Boeing  had reported outsized orders, making the decline in August unsurprising. The Commerce Department revised slightly lower its estimate for growth in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft during August. However, the department also said July's slight drop in this gauge, which is seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, was smaller than previously estimated.

Thomson ReutersLogo of Swiss drugmaker Novartis is seen at its headquarters in BaselBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will widen a probe into Zimmer Holdings Inc's  $13.4 billion bid for Biomet Inc [LVBHAB.UL] but clear Eli Lilly's  offer for a Novartis AG  unit, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The two deals are among several announced in recent months in the healthcare sector, with drugmakers seeking to gain scale or specialise in certain disease areas. The European Commission, which has been reviewing the deal since August,  will open an in-depth investigation into the Zimmer, Biomet deal because of concerns that it may reduce competition, the people said. The acquisition would make U.S. medical device maker Zimmer the second-largest seller of orthopaedics products behind Johnson &amp; Johnson , boosting its presence in the fast-growing sports medicine sector. In contrast, the EU competition authority had no issues with U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly's proposed $5.4 billion takeover of Swiss peer Novartis' animal health business, the sources said.

Thomson ReutersWarren Buffet leaves the first session of the annual Allen and Co. conference at the Sun ValleyNEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive officer of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc, praised Coca-Cola's altered executive compensation plan on Thursday. "I think the new plan makes great, great, sense," Buffett told cable business channel CNBC, referring to Coca-Cola's new guidelines to limit its executive compensation plan, starting next year. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc holds 9.1 percent of Coca-Cola and is the company's biggest shareholder, said he felt as good about his investment in Coca-Cola as he ever has. Buffett said Burger King Worldwide Inc's $11.5 billion purchase of Tim Hortons Inc was not a tax-motivated deal. Investors and tax experts have said the main reason for Burger King to move its domicile to Canada, its largest market, is to avoid having to pay double taxation on profits earned abroad. The company would probably be subject to double taxation if it remained in the United States. Buffett also said his company's purchase of auto dealership group Van Tuyl Group, which was announced Thursday, was an all-cash deal. He said Berkshire would likely buy more dealerships. Buffett also said if he were invested in asset manager Pimco, he would not change his investment based on the departure of former Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross, which was announced last week.

CNBCWarren Buffett.Warren Buffett just finished an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box. Buffett talked about auto dealerships, interest rates, the stock market, and LeBron James. Buffett was also asked about the Burger King-Tim Horton's merger, a "tax inversion" deal that will see Burger King move its headquarters from Miami to Canada. Buffett defended the deal and spoke a bit about the tax code, which he said need an overhaul. Overall, Buffett is bullish on the future of car sales in the US, but reiterated his investing philosophy that he thinks about buying pieces of businesses and that moves in the price of company's stocks shouldn't be the reason for buying or selling any holding. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, kicked off the interview announcing that Berkshire Hathaway bought Van Tuyl Group, which operates car dealerships. "We're playing the strength in autos now," Buffett said, adding, "I fully expect we'll buy a lot more dealerships over time." Buffett declined to comment on the size of the deal but said Van Tuyl's sales were about $9 billion. Van Tuyl is the fifth-largest auto dealership group in the US.  Buffett's announcement that Berkshire is acquiring Van Tuyl comes after Buffett last month commented on the strength in the auto industry in an interview on Bloomberg TV.  Buffett said the deal would be made with cash and that Van Tuyl would be a Fortune 500 company on its own. Berkshire now owns 9 1/2 companies that, were they to stand alone, would be on the Fortune 500. Buffett said Gross leaving PIMCO was "huge news ... a big story." Buffett added, however, that he did not know anything about Gross' departure beyond what had been written about it. Buffett said that, as far as he knew, no investments or pension funds for Berkshire companies had investments in PIMCO. And in fact, all of the pension funds for Berkshire's portfolio companies — except for a few of the utility companies — are 100% in stocks. Buffett said he had owned junk bonds a few different times but did not currently. On the broader bond market, Buffett says that when he sees a US 10-year Treasury Bond at 2.4%: "I'm not salivating." Buffett said of interest rates around the world: "I don't really understand it ... and I don't really have to understand it." On the recent moves in the stock market, Buffett said: "Well yesterday, we bought a business. We would've bought it if the market was down 200 points or up 200 points." "We actually bought a few stocks yesterday," Buffett said, adding that, "if you told me the stock market was going to go down 500 points next week, I would've bought those businesses anyway." Buffett said the stocks he bought were "stocks you know." "When stocks go down, I will be more aggressive" in buying stocks, Buffett said.  "Anybody that has owned a cross-section of American businesses over last 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years has done fine," Buffett said.  On the stock market broadly, he said "everything is a function of interest rates ... interest rates are like gravity." "If interest rates were 10%, all of our stocks would be worth less." Buffett said then that with interest rates near 0%, all assets were worth more. "Every asset, at present value, is worth the cash it will return before its termination date." "I have no notion of what the next 18 months are going to look like, and I never have ... I don't think anybody does," Buffett said, adding that the question was not whether you know what's going to happen next, but whether you can do something intelligent without knowing. "You are buying businesses when you buy stocks," Buffett said.  On the sectors in the US economy that are interesting Buffett, he says he looks at opportunities as they come along but that he isn't making any judgment about where the market is going and not considering any macroeconomic factors.  On Wednesday, Coke announced a new executive compensation plan that Buffett said made "great sense." Coke's new plan involves a reduction in stock-based compensation. Earlier this year, Buffett said he disagreed with Coke's executive compensation plan but abstained from voting against it. "I think it was the right thing to do," Buffett said.  Regarding these changes, Buffett said he was involved "only when they asked me ... [Coke] was not adversarial." "I feel as good about my Coke investment as I've ever felt." Buffett is financing Burger King's merger with Tim Horton's, and Andrew Ross Sorkin asked whether he thought financing the deal (Buffett is providing $3 billion of financing for the deal, which is a tax inversion that will see Burger King move its headquarters to Canada), is un-American. "Overwhelmingly, most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation, but I can tell you this one didn't," Buffett said.  "It doesn't have anything to do with taxes," Buffett said. "It has to do with Tim Horton's earns twice as much money as Burger King, and this deal has to go before Canadian authorities." Buffett said the tax code, however, needed an overhaul. "I think the four of us at this table could write a better" tax program, Buffett said. On the broader economy, Buffett said that since the third quarter of 2009, the businesses he owns have improved "at a constant pace." "If you look at the overall [economy], the improvement has been remarkably consistent, but the mood swings have been considerable," Buffett said.  But despite this steady improvement, the economy has not taken off, Buffett said.  On Fed policy, CNBC's Steve Liesman asked if he had a few: "No." Adding that if he were on the Fed, "I wouldn't know what the hell to do." "Hedge funds after fees, in my view, are not going to deliver a return as good as a low-cost index fund," Buffett said.  Buffett said he sent LeBron James a congratulatory note after LeBron announced he was returning to Cleveland. "I'm really glad LeBron went back," Buffett said. On Alibaba: "I don't think we've bought an IPO in over 50 years." On the AIG lawsuit, Buffett said that AIG was going broke and that there wasn't "anybody in the world, including us, who could've bailed them out ... The factual question over whether AIG could've lasted another 24 hours is clear to me."

At a meeting in Naples, Italy, the ECB announced it was leaving rates unchanged, as expected.  Draghi said covered bond purchases will begin this month and asset-backed purchases will begin this quarter.

Wikimedia CommonsNEW YORK (Reuters) - Managers of equity long/short funds cut their net exposure in September, a month during which markets pulled back on a rising dollar and questions over the timing of the Federal Reserve's next rate hike, Credit Suisse wrote in a note. The declines came across regions and sectors, though there was an emphasis in cyclical sectors. "These reductions in longs and adds to shorts brought the long-short ratio to a [year-to-date] low of 43 percent as returns and the European growth outlook both wane," the firm said in the note published late Wednesday. Short hedge funds returned an average of 5.9 percent through September, Credit Suisse wrote, on pace for 490 basis points of outperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500, "the highest since at least January 2013."

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach ECB president Mario Draghi. The European Central Bank has left rates unchanged, as expected, in its meeting Thursday. Draghi explained the ECB's latest decision, but gave very little on the details of their new asset purchases scheme. There are still no indications of the size of the offering. Here's what he said.  European markets have taken a dive: it looks like people were expecting a little bit more from this announcement. Germany's DAX is down 0.87%. France's CAC 40 is down 1.47%. Spain's IBEX is down 1.94%. Italy's FTSE MIB is leading the pack, down by 2.94%. You can see the impact on France's CAC 40 here: Bloomberg We're also getting some reaction through from analysts now. In a note, Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: "Draghi distanced himself slightly from the movements in the 5y/5y forward rate by noting that the ECB looks at several inflation measures. This is no doubt an attempt to unshackle himself from the strong link between policy and this measure ascribed to the ECB following the president’s comments at Jackson Hole." Peter Tchir at Brean Capital adds: "Expect bond markets and equity markets to fade as they don't get what they were hoping for and as much as Draghi will try and make it seem like he has more to do, disappointment will sink in." The central bankers are in Naples, Italy, to announce their latest monetary policy decisions.  The ECB has laid out some of the details of the asset-backed securities and covered bonds it plans to buy. The purchasing plan is going to "include bundles of Greek and Cypriot bank loans with 'junk' ratings, a move that is likely to be unpopular with Germany," as the Financial Times said. The ECB is looking to bring back its balance sheet to around €3 trillion ($3.8 trillion), which would require an increase of around €1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) from where it currently stands. We've got no detail on the size of the purchases, which would have provided a good indicator of whether the central bank can achieve that balance sheet boost. A Reuters poll of Eurozone money market traders suggested that €200 billion ($252.7 billion) in ABS and covered bond purchases are expected. Jefferies' Marchel Alexandrovich expects that a smaller announcement of €80-100 billion ($101-126 billion) purchases would be enough “to signal a serious commitment.” Societe Generale analysts are expecting an announcement more in the range of €130-150 billion ($164-189 billion).

AP Photo/Scott HeppellBad timings for Wonga, as the UK loaner has been forced to write off £220 million of debtsAbout 330,000 lucky debtors are receiving a boost of £667 ($1,076) on average because Wonga, the UK's biggest payday lender, agreed to write off the debts of its costumers on more than 30 days of arrears as of Oct. 2.  The total debt amounts to £220 million ($355 million). The move comes after the Financial Conduct Authority ruled that "Wonga was not taking adequate steps to assess customers’ ability to meet repayments in a sustainable manner," and decided to grant the debtors with a freebie.  Roughly 45,000 more debtors, in arrears of 29 days or less, will only have to pay the initial debt without interest or charges, and will have four more extra months to repay their debts. The FCA first looked into the lender's books in April this year, and in June its CEO and founder/chairman both left the company just before police decided not to pursue a criminal investigation. Wonga, famous for sponsoring British Premier League team Newcastle United, is extremely big in the UK. Wonga was not available for a comment when we contacted them. Other lenders could follow suit as Clive Adamson, FCA director of supervision, said: “We are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations. This should put the rest of the industry on notice – they need to lend affordably and responsibly." The £220 million includes interests and charges for late debtors, and the whole move is expected to cost Wonga only £35 million ($56.5 million) in principal cash, the initial amount loaned.  Wonga's pre-tax revenues dropped by 35% in the last year, Sky News reported.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Murad SezerGoldman Sachs confirmed its intention to kill off Bloomberg's chat system with the acquisition of a company called Symphony on Wednesday.  Thirteen other institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, were involved in the $66 million purchase, a move that will likely turn heads at Bloomberg, which has largely dominated the market for a financial sector communications tool. Banks have been whining about the cost of Bloomberg’s $20,000 terminals for a long time, but setting up their own systems probably won't be a huge money-saver. Privacy is the massive elephant in the room here. The issue is Bloomberg’s blunder over reporter access to some of its products. Bloomberg reporters with access to the company's systems could see the search functions that traders operating the systems were using, as well as when they logged on and off. Goldman and other banks had already been looking in to developing their own messaging systems, and this news seems to have spurred them on. It seems several several banks are still concerned about privacy issues, even after Bloomberg’s own investigation found that the reporters were not using what they found as direct material in articles. The system Goldman and the other institutions have now purchased is not just safe from reporters — it's designed to be safe from just about everyone. Bloomberg terminals offer a lot of other features, but the messaging aspect creates a network that it's hard to disengage from, so new systems could weaken the company's hold on the market. David Rho at MMG Partners also told the Wall Street Journal that if Bloomberg lost their message system domination, they could be forced to reprice their terminals.  There's another aspect to the security discussion that might soon crop up. Perzo, the private communications service that Symphony will use, is designed to be incredibly secure. As Business Insider’s  Dylan Love reported back in November, before it was clear that Perzo would be used for financial services “It's designed in such a way that any third party, Perzo included, can't decode the messages.”  That was considered to be a great defense against any national agencies that might want to look at your communications. But it’s not clear what it would mean if a regulator wanted to look into Goldman employees’ message history. The system will be ready in mid-2015, so it probably won't be long before we find out.  FREE AppDownload
TBIInitial jobless claims fell to 287,000 during the week ending September 27 from 295,000 the week prior. This was better than the 297,000 expected by economists. This brought the 4-week moving average to 294,750, down 4,250 from a week ago. "The ongoing decline in weekly jobless claims continues to suggest that labor market slack is on the decline, with the layoff side of the labor equation remaining on a path of gradual improvement as claims hover around cycle lows," TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg said. Continuing claims fell to 2.398 million from 2.443 million. "he gradual improvement in continuing claims is particularly encouraging and is consistent with recent declines in the unemployment rate, suggesting that unemployed workers continue to find gainful employment," Goldberg added.

Thomson ReutersPresident of Emirates Airlines Tim Clark speaks during a news conference at the Emirates Terminal at Dubai International AirportDUBAI (Reuters) - The president of Emirates airlines [EMIRA.UL] said on Thursday that demand for flights to Africa from Asia has fallen due to concerns over the Ebola virus. West Africa is struggling with the worst Ebola outbreak since the disease was identified in 1976, with 3,338 people known to have died, predominantly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Senegal, according to latest figures. Emirates, one of the world's largest carriers, has helped Dubai become a global aviation hub, and the city is a major stop-over point for Asian customers traveling to Africa. "There are indications that demand in the east is coming off a little bit because of the perception that Ebola is Africa-wide," Tim Clark, Emirates president, told an Africa-focused investment event in Dubai. "There are segments of our business in China, Taiwan, Vietnam etcetera that are fairly cautious about what they are doing, but for every one of those we lose, we're filling with something else." Emirates in August suspended flights to Guinea, where the ongoing Ebola outbreak originated, but has continued flying to other affected destinations. Clark said the airline was not considering halting any other African routes. Emirates staff look for signs that passengers may be unwell, but otherwise the airline is not taking any other extra precautions for Ebola. "We don't have armies of people as we had with the SARS virus for instance – that was a pandemic that was far greater than Ebola in its spreading contagion," Clark told reporters on the sidelines of the event. "But we're not providing our crews with masks because it (Ebola) will be controlled." Emirates flies to about 22 destinations in Africa, he said, predicting it could add another 10 to the continent by 2025 as well as raising the frequency of flights on some existing routes. "We're looking at Mozambique," said Clark. "Where you see oil and gas discovery, (it) has got to be of interest for people like ourselves. We can connect the oil and gas human resource. We can connect the cargo into the oil and gas fields. A lot of the stuff travels by air. We're constantly looking for opportunities."   (Writing by David French; Editing by Hugh Lawson) FREE AppDownload
aldenjewell / Flickr Warren Buffett was on CNBC on Thursday morning, and he just announced that Berkshire Hathaway had purchased Van Tuyl Group, a company based in Arizona that owns 78 auto dealers. He strongly suggested that Berkshire would buy more auto dealers, probably using Van Tuyl as a vehicle to do an industry rollup. Why the move? It's clear Buffett sees plenty of room for consolidation in the industry, as Buffett notes that there are 17,000 dealers in the country. Folks on Twitter are also pointing out that dealers often have great real estate and nice, regulated moats in their industry, which is the kind of thing that Buffett likes to own.

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Thursday, following a sharp drop in the previous session as investors looked to upcoming economic data for trading incentives. * Equities have been weak of late, with the S&amp;P 500 down for seven of the past nine sessions, and closing under its 100-day moving average for the first time since Aug. 7 on Wednesday. * While the benchmark index is only 3.2 percent away from its record close, the Russell 2000 &lt;.TOY&gt; on Wednesday ended more than 10 percent below its own record, putting the small-cap index in correction territory. * Small-cap stocks are considered a leading sector of the market, and some market participants are concerned the weakness could spread throughout Wall Street. However, the Russell also underwent a sharp pullback earlier this year, which didn't lead to similar losses in the S&amp;P. * Wednesday's losses followed the first diagnosis of a patient with Ebola in the United States, news that pressured equities broadly but had an outsized impact on airline and transportation companies. * Weekly jobless claims will be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT and are seen rising by 4,000 to 297,000 in the latest week.

Thomson ReutersA new Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sign is pictured after being unveiled at Chrysler Group World Headquarters in Auburn Hills, MichiganPARIS (Reuters) - While rivals roll out new models and concept cars, Fiat has little to show at the Paris auto show besides another variant of its retro-styled 500 compact car, in what is starting to look like a worrying trend for the carmaker's namesake brand. Following the full takeover of U.S. unit Chrysler, the newly-named Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has set out an ambitious growth plan focused on its upmarket Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep brands. Analysts say it makes sense to concentrate on higher-margin premium vehicles that are selling strongly in the United States and emerging markets, but are concerned the group is neglecting a Fiat brand which still accounts for a large chunk of sales. FCA sold 1.5 million Fiats last year, with deliveries of the mass-market brand accounting for 34 percent of the group total. The 500X debuting in Paris should help lift sales by adding to the popular mini-SUV category. But the crossover car is unlikely to significantly change the face of Fiat's core brand, starved of models and stuck with an aging line-up. "The 500 is getting older and older, the success of its variants has been limited and they lack a competitive offering at a time when Volkswagen, Peugeot and Renault continue to launch new cars," said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at Commerzbank. "Even if the European recovery was gaining momentum, Fiat would definitely lose out." DaveOnFlickr via Compfight ccA Fiat 500 Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne struck gold in 2007 when he chose the 500 hatchback to revive the flagging Fiat marque, selling more than a million in the six years after relaunch. Sold in more than 100 countries the Fiat 500 -- as Italian as a cup of espresso or actress Sophia Loren -- was meant to be Marchionne's answer to BMW's Mini and help drive sales of other models within the Fiat family. But a strategy that got off to a promising start hit a few bumps in the road, not least an economic crisis that pushed car sales in Europe into a six-year slump, from which the sector is only gradually recovering. European sales of the 500 are still high but have come down from their 2008-9 peaks, despite customized features and electric and cabriolet versions. A rise in buyer incentives in the United States and Europe to boost sales also hints at problems and risks devaluing the product, analysts say. Meanwhile, Fiat dealers say the 500 revamp has failed to rub off on other cars within the brand, some of which are looking tired. Fiat's Punto hatchback is already nine years old. "Mini did the classic rollout of keeping sales steady over the years by slowly and steadily introducing product variations, but Fiat is not that disciplined," said Jane Nakagawa, managing director at Portia Consulting. "To the average consumer, the variations they have come out with were relatively invisible." Fiat's global market share in the B-segment of small sub-compact cars has fallen from 9.3 percent in 2007 to 6.2 percent last year and is expected to dip below that level to 5.7 percent by 2018, according to forecaster IHS Automotive. In the city car A-segment, under which Fiat's popular 500 and Panda models fall, Fiat's market share is seen falling from around 7 percent to just under 5 percent between 2007-18.  Fiat needed half the time it took Mini or Kia to breach the 40,000 sales mark in the U.S. market, but deliveries there peaked in 2012, and fell 18 percent last year. The larger five-door 500L was hit by two recalls and the Serbian factory which produces the model was temporarily suspended last month due to "market conditions". "The 500L recall was a bump in the road and we are ready to move on," said Jason Stoicevich, head of the Fiat brand for North America. He said Fiat was on track to have its best sales year in the United States this year since the brand was brought back there in 2011, with sales through September up 8 percent. Stoicevich is betting on the 500X to speak to U.S. consumers who like sport utility vehicles (SUVs), are looking for something larger than a city car, and want a sturdier car with all-wheel drive capability to withstand harsher weather. "This is going to be a real game-changer," he said. "It is the first vehicle we will put on the road here where there really is no reason for rejection in terms of either size or capability."  ChryslerFiat 500 Gucci As a group, FCA plans to invest 48 billion euros ($61 billion) over five years to boost sales by 60 percent to 7 million cars. Its ambitions for Fiat are more modest in comparison: sales are seen growing by nearly 30 percent to 1.9 vehicles by 2018, with the brand focusing growth on the Americas and Asia, while aiming to keep deliveries flat in a struggling European market. But some analysts think that will be a tall order, especially if Fiat has to compete with Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep for the heavily indebted group's stretched finances. They also say Fiat's five-year product pipeline of 27 new entries includes few surprises besides remakes of its popular 500, Panda, or Punto models. By 2017, the brand will only feature two or three models in the fast-growing compact SUV segment, they add. FCA said during its strategy announcement it recognized the need to purify the DNA of the Fiat brand, and that it would develop products that are either "functional" or "aspirational". It also said it would leverage the 500 family to expand in the upper segment of the mainstream market. "That entire brand has lots of magic sprinkled on their product," said Portia's Nakagawa, referring to the 500’s past successes and the new Panda, which has been selling well. "But they also need to make some hard choices about which models fit the idea of functional or aspirational, and which need to go."

Occupying the higher ground, Putin said that despite the difficult conditions, Russia would have an independent and strong economy, one with a healthy balance sheet that would have no need to restrict the movement of capital. "We truly want a country that is strong, flourishing, free and open to the world," he told the VTB Russia Calling investment conference. He reiterated the importance of developing ties with Russia's partners to the east, congratulating companies which had already done deals with Chinese companies and said Russia would aim to shift to national currencies in trade. Paying little attention to the sliding fortunes of Russia's weakening economy, Putin listed Russia's budget triumphs and the growth rates in the industrial and agricultural sectors. "Our task is to bring about an industrial breakthrough, to create strong national companies in manufacturing sectors that are able to produce competitive products," he said. He said the government was prepared to support sectors and companies that have been hit by the sanctions, imposed over the Ukraine crisis, adding: "This would include helping them raise capital. First and foremost, I mean financial institutions." (Writing by Elizabeth Piper, Editing by Timothy Heritage) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Carlo Allegri A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York June 9, 2014.  One of the big inputs in the US stock market rally since the nadir in March 2009 has been the expansion of the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet under its bond buying program known as quantitative easing (QE). There have been three tranches of bond buying and each has buoyed the market while the Fed was buying bonds and expanding its balance sheet. But at the end of quantitative easing, QE 1 and QE 2, when the Fed was no longer buying bonds, stocks swooned. So as we enter October, and with stocks in the US under pressure, the reality of an end to the Fed’s quantitative easing bond buying program this month looms large on the markets radar. Traders know that at both previous occasions stocks fell and are likely worrying about the same thing happening now in 2014. What is worrying is that as traders act on their natural instinct to sell stocks before everyone else does, the S&amp;P 500 is now at a very important juncture on the trend line of the QE 3 stock market rally. A break would signal that, just like the end to QE 1 and QE 2, a pull back in stocks both in the US and around the world is going to accelerate. It’s been too long since a 10% correction and many traders believe one is now due.

Dr. Ed's BlogThe strength in the Emerging Markets MSCI stock price index since early February has been somewhat surprising. That’s mostly because the EM MSCI tends to be highly correlated with the CRB raw industrials spot price index, which has been weakening since it peaked this year on April 24. In recent days, the correlation has come back with a vengeance as the stock index has plunged 8.7% since September 3. There may be more trouble ahead given the close correlation between the EM MSCI and the inverse of the trade-weighted dollar. Why is this happening all of a sudden? It looks like another Fed tightening tantrum may be underway. If so, then the confidence that Fed officials have had in their ability to normalize US monetary policy without destabilizing the global financial system may get shaken.

The Case-Shiller house price indexes for July were released yesterday. Zillow has started forecasting Case-Shiller a month early - and I like to check the Zillow forecasts since they have been pretty close. Note: Hopefully Zillow will start estimating the National Index.From Zillow: Find Out Next Month’s Case-Shiller Numbers Today  The July S&amp;P/Case-Shiller (SPCS) data out this morning indicated continued slowing in the housing market with the annual change in the 20-city index falling to 6.7 percent from 8.1 percent the prior month. Our current forecast for SPCS next month indicates further slowing with the annual increase in the 20-City Composite Home Price Index falling to 5.7 percent in August. The non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) monthly increase in July for the 20-City index was 0.6 percent, and we expect it to fall to 0.3 percent next month. All forecasts are shown in the table below. These forecasts are based on the July SPCS data release this morning and the August 2014 Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), released September 18. Officially, the SPCS Composite Home Price Indices for August will not be released until Tuesday, October 28. So the Case-Shiller index will probably show a lower year-over-year gain in August than in July (6.7% year-over-year for the Composite 20 in July, 5.6% year-over-year for the National Index).

AP ImagesMichael JordanLONDON (Reuters) - Bill Gross' exit from Pimco has seen billions of dollars leave the fund group and even more value wiped off the share price of its parent company, offering a warning both to firms who rely on star managers and the investors who chase them. Gross's flagship Pimco Total Return Fund lost money every month from May last year, totaling nearly $70 billion by the end of August, Lipper data shows. More money has left since he was escorted to the door of the firm he co-founded in 1971. With much of a mutual or hedge fund firm's value tied up in the brain power of its employees, as opposed to bricks, mortar and other hard assets, the loss of an important employee - known in the trade as "key man risk" - exposes the firm to asset flight which can even force it to sell holdings at a loss. From the corporate blow dealt to Invesco Perpetual after it lost high-performing fund boss Neil Woodford earlier this year to the investors forced to move after hedge fund Highbridge Capital closed its Asia fund when its regional head left in 2011, the risk is industry-wide and notoriously disruptive. Some have sought to protect themselves by fostering a 'team culture', while others, such as hedge fund Brevan Howard, have used employee non-compete clauses and turned to the courts in a bid to limit the impact of important staff leaving. "Fund firms are caught in a delicate balancing act," said Julian Bartlett, a partner at consultants Grant Thornton. "They realize that star managers sell, but that they also create a vulnerability if the firm over-promotes the fact that the success of a strategy is down to an individual," he added. BETTER TO STAY? Pimco's parent company Allianz saw its shares shed $5 billion in a panic selloff on the day Gross left, a fall that implied a drop in assets at Pimco of nearly twice the amount managed by Gross. While the share reaction was "massively overdone", a London-based European fund manager said on the day, analysts at Morningstar nevertheless downgraded Pimco's Total Return Fund to "Bronze" from "Gold" citing uncertainty around just how much money would follow Gross out the door. By contrast, Gross's new employer, Janus Capital, saw its shares soar nearly 40 percent as investors bet Gross would act as a magnet for investor funds. But those who stay put may have played the better hand. Lipper data shows that the heir to the throne of the "Bond King", Dan Ivascyn, has been a more successful manager in recent years, making nearly three times the gains recorded by Gross over three and five years, and was on the way to beating him again in 2014, although at a much lower asset base. Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon, the Dutch pensions, life insurance and asset manager, said that pattern was far from uncommon. "Those removing their money from high performing funds purely because the key man has departed, could be missing out on what remain benchmark-beating returns," he said. "The greatest fund managers and companies share their knowledge with the aim of fostering a culture that leads to continuous outperformance, passing down expertise to understudies who will one day become protégés." Among those to do it well were Henderson's EU Select Opportunities fund, which chalked up outperformance of 3.8 percent in the 17 years that Roger Guy was at the helm, while successor John Bennett managed to beat by 2.2 percent, he said. While funds may have succession plans in place, history shows it can be hard to persuade investors to stay. Neil Woodford, for example, left Invesco Perpetual, a unit of U.S. firm Invesco, earlier this year to start up on his own and took billions of pounds with him. From the time Woodford said he planned to leave, $4.9 billion has left Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, while Woodford's new firm has grown to manage 2.7 billion pounds since launch in June this year. Even though the Invesco fund has outperformed its benchmark by 2.75 percentage points in the six months since he left the firm, investors voted with their feet, given his performance over more than 25 years career at Invesco Perpetual. Woodford's Invesco fund had returned more than 2,200 percent while the FTSE All-Share Total Return index rose 868 percent during the period, Lipper data showed. By the time he left, he managed nearly half of Invesco Perpetual's total assets. HEDGE THE HEDGE For all the headlines grabbed by Pimco and Gross, and the various examples of asset outflows at mutual fund managers which can be particularly bad for listed firms, the biggest concentration of "key man risk" for investors is in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry. Typically founded by a person or small group of people, hedge funds often use borrowed money to make big bets in quite illiquid markets to generate outperformance - all of which leaves them even more vulnerable to changes in management. Even though many of the largest fund firms are looking to diversify and become more like mutual funds, the vast majority rely on a single product generally dependent on a single manager, with all the investor risk that implies. Nearly nine out of every ten hedge fund firms tracked by Eurekahedge have no more than two products, while three quarters of the 3,736 companies have just one product. Pressure from institutional investors such as pension funds to protect against key man risk have led some hedge funds to deepen team expertise and bring in an independent risk manager, with the power to step in and liquidate portfolios if needed. Alan Howard, owner of top European hedge fund Brevan Howard, resorted to an onerous five-year non-compete clause in an attempt to limit the impact of star trader Christopher Rokos from leaving - a shackle he is currently trying to break in the High Court. At the most cataclysmic end, the exit of an important figure can mean the end of the fund itself, such as when Highbridge Capital was forced to liquidate its Asia fund in 2011 after regional head Carl Huttenlocher left to start his own fund. While investors can always choose to move their money elsewhere, not all are aware of the dangers of being forced to. "There are a lot of newer investors into hedge funds who have not fully factored that (key person risk) in," said Chris Hawkins, a portfolio manager at fund of hedge funds Gottex. "I think that type of investor probably doesn't price correctly the risk of key man and consequently it's more of a box having been checked rather than really thinking about what it means, what rights we should be able to have in the event if there is a problem," he said. Mandate contracts between investors and hedge funds usually have a "key man clause", which can lay out protections and rights to withdraw money if a manager leaves or is incapacitated. But it is not a panacea, said Steven Clark, founder of Omni Partners, pointing out that other factors besides departure or death can affect a fund manager's performance, and investors may not always be able to get money back as quickly as they want. "It's not just the case of the guy getting hit by a bus. Other things can go wrong with your key man that are not necessarily covered in any document," he said.   (Editing by Peter Graff) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA man wears a Google Glass at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San FranciscoDUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai police plan to issue detectives with Google Glass hands-free eyewear to help them fight crime using facial recognition technology, a police spokesman in the wealthy Gulf Arab emirate said. The wearable device consists of a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame and is capable of taking photos, recording video and playing sound. The spokesman confirmed a report in Dubai's 7 Days newspaper that software developed by Dubai police would enable a connection between the wearer and a database of wanted people. Once the device "recognized" a suspect based on a face print, it would alert the officer wearing the gadget. The gadget would be used in a first phase to combat traffic violations and track vehicles suspected of involvement in motoring offences. A second phase would see the technology rolled out to detectives, the spokesman said. The U.S. Internet company said in a blogpost in May that anyone in the United States could buy the gadget for $1,500. Dubai's decision appears in line with the authorities' determination to spare no expense in equipping the police. Last year Dubai announced it would supply its police with $400,000 Lamborghini sports cars for use at major tourist sites. Dubai's deputy police chief said the vehicles were in keeping with the Gulf capital's image. Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE federation, is staging a recovery from the financial crisis it suffered during the global financial crisis in 2009. The emirate recently announced several big projects, including a huge tourism and retail development with the largest shopping mall in the world.   (Reporting by William Maclean; Editing by Mark Heinrich) FREE AppDownload

FinViz There are lots of theories for why oil is behaving so ugly. One of them is the possibility that the global economy is slowing down, with weakness seen in both China and Europe (exacerbated by the situation in Russia). There's also evidence that supply is bigger in OPEC than previously thought. And then there's the general risk-off sentiment we've seen across markets lately, with people selling off stocks and buying the dollar (and in fact equities around the world are lower again Thursday).

This wasn't some passing reference to the (genuinely) "Herculean" task he faces trying to kickstart the European economy and stave off deflation. This was a detailed description of the whole Hercules v. the hydra myth (including the part most people forget, where Hercules' nephew deals with the hydra's severed heads). REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Hercules, fighting a hydra.Note that, as the Wall Street Journal tells it, Draghi seems to be casting himself as one of Europe's Hercules-es: “As policymakers in Italy and in the euro area, it often feels like we face a Herculean task to revive growth and bring down unemployment,” he said in prepared remarks for a dinner Wednesday on the eve of the ECB’s monthly policy meeting, which takes place in Naples. “And just like Hercules confronting the Hydra, it sometimes seems as though just as we defeat one challenge, such as the sovereign debt crisis, two new challenges spring up, such as low inflation and a weak recovery,” he said. ... “It is also worth remembering how Hercules defeated the Hydra: While he cut off its head, his nephew cauterized the neck. In other words, he simultaneously tackled the problem on the surface and at the root,” Mr. Draghi said. “And this is exactly what we need to do today in the euro area,” he said.

REUTERS/Andrew Winning LONDON (Reuters) - "Things are always unnoticed, until they're noticed," Tesco Chairman Richard Broadbent said when asked how Britain's biggest retailer had failed to spot a 250 million pound ($410 million) sized hole in its first-half profits. It was an oversight that led to a 4 billion pound drop in Tesco's market value and the suspension of four senior executives. The newly installed CEO called in forensic accountants and lawyers to find out what went wrong. Whether conspiracy or cock-up, the scandal raises doubts over the management and financial oversight at Britain's largest private sector employer, now in the midst of the gravest crisis in its 95-year history. "That whole finance organization must be in a world of hurt given what has gone on. The rigor and analysis and the focus seems to have fallen away a little bit," one former UK Tesco director told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. Tesco had once appeared unstoppable, boasting two decades of uninterrupted earnings growth as it bulldozed its way to dominance. Things began to go wrong in 2011. It has now issued three profit warnings in two months with the latest causing the most alarm - the overstatement of its half-year profit forecast by 250 million pounds due to the early recognition of payments by suppliers and the pushing back of costs. Investors, analysts and some former employees are questioning whether an aggressive culture influenced the way the company handled its finances - especially when trading slowed - and perhaps prevented staff from coming forward to warn that the numbers no longer stacked up. Tesco has declined to comment on what may have happened until a review has been completed but chairman Broadbent has described it as "something completely out of the ordinary". The revelation has also sparked scrutiny of the upper echelons of the company. The senior executives who ran Tesco during its glory years of the 1990s and 2000s have all left and the board lacks retail experience. "The chairman has been the leader of this organization that seems to have failed at every turn," said David Herro of large Tescon investor Harris Associates. Four former senior Tesco executives have told Reuters that during the 2011-2014 CEO tenure of Phil Clarke, he repeatedly clashed with directors, who found him reluctant to take advice. During that time four of the company's most senior executives quit, taking a combined 109 years of experience with them. Clarke has declined to comment on his management style but defenders of his record point out that he was battling the most difficult market conditions in decades. The company's head of digital told a conference this week Tesco was too big and complex to be run by "one general". People outside the company have many questions - not least who has been signing off on profit forecasts in the last three months which turned out, quickly, to be wrong. By the time the group issued the second of its recent profit warnings on August. 29, Clarke, a 40-year Tesco veteran, was technically still CEO but was working his notice while Laurie McIlwee, the firm's chief financial officer since 2009, had quit on April 4. McIlwee declined to comment for this article. "It seems unbelievable that a retailing colossus like Tesco should not have a full-time finance director," said Adrian Bailey, head of parliament's business committee. Tesco's finance function had been further weakened in June when Mike Iddon quit as Tesco's group finance director, planning, treasury and tax. Tesco says that after McIlwee's resignation on April 4 it set up a group of senior finance personnel, reporting directly to Clarke. However the company has declined to say who was in that group and Clarke was himself working down his notice. "What was the board's scrutiny of the (second) profit warning (on Aug. 29) and numbers that they put out, because you would expect it to be extreme?" asked one retail audit committee chairman, in reference to the profit downgrade and 75 percent cut to Tesco's interim dividend. "If you're a non-executive director and you're being asked to put out those kind of profound numbers and you've got no finance director and you've got no CEO to stand beside them, how do you know they're right?" Tesco said the 250 million pound overstatement principally related to its supplier contracts within the food business of its UK division - its home market which generated 48.2 billion pounds of revenue in 2013-14. People familiar with how Tesco operates said it had been overly ambitious when predicting sales. As they then slowed, the cash rebates paid out by suppliers as incentives also dropped. Tesco has declined to comment but said it is investigating the accounts. New CEO Dave Lewis has told staff the firm's culture needs to change. The former UK Tesco director believes the accounting mistake could have come about due to the combination of a loss of experience in the finance department and the fact that the business is now shrinking. "You had a business that used to be growing and had algorithms that worked," the former director said. "When the business is flat to declining and you don't really know how much you're declining by, you can get that wrong very quickly." During two decades of uninterrupted growth Tesco had rarely made a mistake with its numbers - it issued its first profit warning in living memory in 2012 as the competition ramped up. However, analysts and shareholders have more recently raised concerns that Clarke and his colleagues had instilled a more aggressive approach as pressure to revive the business increased. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who was previously a supply chain director of Tesco Asia, said managers - possibly under pressure to improve earnings - might have brought forward promotions and the right to book supplier rebates. Tesco declined to comment. Cantor analyst Mike Dennis, who last year questioned how the company could be maintaining its trading margin at a time of falling sales and rising costs, noted that staff had been incentivized via share schemes to maintain the measure. PwC [PWC.UL] Tesco's auditors since 1983, had highlighted the rebate issue in its 2013-14 report as an "area of focus" due to the "risk of manipulation". Broadbent says Tesco's finance function was "working well with considerable oversight". Analysts and investors have pointed out that the board is now very thin on retail experience. Broadbent, chairman for almost three years, was a former public official and banker. Others on the board have experience in telecoms, media, finance and cars, while Patrick Cescau, the board's senior independent director, is a former chairman of Unilever, one of Tesco's biggest suppliers. "In a situation such as this, the buck stops at the board," said Guy Jubb, head of governance and stewardship at Tesco investor Standard Life Investments. Having drafted in the replacements for Clarke and McIlwee earlier than expected, the board now has two executive directors in the form of new CEO Lewis from Unilever and CFO Alan Stewart, formerly of Marks &amp; Spencer. Stewart was appointed during the time of former CEO Clarke. Tesco declined to comment on the retail experience of its board, or on who was involved in the planning of the Aug. 29 statement. Trading statements do not have to be checked by an external accounting firm. But the numbers are now being pored over. A swathe of managers have had to hand in their laptops and phones as part of the internal probe and Britain's Serious Fraud Office has said it is watching events closely. The country's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has launched a full investigation and lawmakers are also considering whether to grill past and present executives over the error.

REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, on Sept. 4 arrives for the ECB's monthly news conference in Frankfurt.At 7:45 a.m. ET on Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its latest decision on rates and monetary policy, with ECB president Mario Draghi taking press questions 45 minutes later.  Nobody is really expecting any more rate cuts: the marginal lending facility is at 0.3%, the main refinancing rate is at 0.05%, and the deposit rate is at -0.2%. Draghi has indicated that this is about as low as it's going to get. Since last month's big ECB meeting, pretty much everything in the eurozone is slightly worse. Business surveys are indicating slower growth, inflation is now down to 0.3%, and the latest effort to get banks lending disappointed pretty much everyone.   Pantheon MacroeconomicsEurozone inflation is still trending downward, far below the ECB's target. What we will definitely get on Thursday is the details of the asset-backed securities and covered bonds the ECB plans to buy. What exactly the ECB buys and how much of it will be important questions. Marchel Alexandrovich of Jefferies says in a research note that an ECB announcement of €80 billion to €100 billion ($101 billion to $126 billion) purchases would be enough “to signal a serious commitment.” Societe Generale analysts are expecting an announcement of more like €130 to €150 billion ($164 billion to $189 billion). The amount’s important, as we saw with the TLTRO (targeted long-term refinancing operations) announcement in September. The ECB has said it wants to boost its balance sheet back to about €3 trillion ($3.8 trillion), so anything seen as too low could be regarded as a failure. But the composition is also important. According to the Financial Times, Draghi is aiming to buy up securities in some of the most hard-hit countries in the eurozone. If the ECB doesn't go for something like this, it could end up benefiting the core of the eurozone most, the area that least needs stimulus, as Business Insider's Tomas Hirst says.  Aside from this, any suggestions that the ECB will pursue even further easing — ABS and covered bond markets are very small in comparison to the market for government debt, which the ECB could buy with a full QE programme. Calls for QE aren't likely to end Friday.  ECB, BarclaysThe covered bond and ABS markets are tiny compared with sovereign debt.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersElectrician Scronce carries conduits at the construction site of a battery systems plant at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center in McCarran, NevadaRENO Nevada (Reuters) - Lance Gilman bounced his white GMC truck up a hill in the high desert country east of Reno, Nevada, and paused at the top to survey his property. Spread out below lay the 165-square-mile Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, about the size of Rhode Island. "There's a tsunami coming in," Gilman said, referring to the businesses, developers and workers he envisions occupying the place some day. The site, already partly occupied by warehouses and distribution facilities for Wal-Mart, Amazon and Federal Express, is where Elon Musk's electric car maker Tesla Motors plans a factory to make batteries, helped by more than $1 billion of incentives provided by Nevada. Out on the horizon, just past the boundaries of the industrial park, can be seen the red-tiled roofs of another of Gilman's properties: the Mustang Ranch, the first licensed brothel in Nevada. For Gilman, this dry, desolate slice of Storey County is where the old Nevada, symbolized by adult entertainment like gambling and prostitution, meets a new Nevada, where high-tech manufacturing and distribution businesses built on an immense scale may restore some of the state's fabled wealth. "In the 1800s, Storey County was the richest place on earth because of the Comstock Lode, gold and silver," said Gilman, 69, who bought the land for the industrial park with a partner for $20 million in the late 1990s. "Then it became poor. Now, maybe it will be the richest place again." That's a hope shared by Nevadans ranging from Republican Governor Brian Sandoval to the residents of nearby Reno, which exited the recession with an unemployment rate of 14 percent, well above the national peak of 10 percent during the economic downturn. The Tesla deal, negotiated by Sandoval in hope of bringing as many as 22,000 jobs to the state, includes a $5 billion factory to produce lithium ion batteries for electric cars. Tesla alone may employ 6,500 people at the new plant, 20 miles east of Reno. In the past three years, 50 companies have moved to the area, helping cut unemployment in half and restoring some life to a town that calls itself "The Biggest Little City in the World" but is littered with aging casinos and seedy bars. The land where the Tesla plant will be built is an undeveloped portion of the massive industrial park, fully zoned for a commercial center, including seven miles of its own private railroad tracks, a lake for recycled water to use in production, fiber-optic cable already laid throughout and roads planned and approved. The location is next to Interstate 80, a transcontinental highway than runs from New York to San Francisco. "Welcome to Nevada," Wayne H. Wilson, a 51-year-old out-of-work software marketer from Reno wrote in a draft of a letter to Tesla after the deal was announced. "Let's talk." As soon as the deal was announced, real estate brokers began fielding calls, and job-seekers like Wilson sent out resumes. Companies wanting to work with Tesla have been scouting locations, and community colleges and training centers are trying to figure out how to prepare unemployed residents for the new jobs. Among the training programs under consideration is one on how to work with and dispose of hazardous by-products of making the batteries, said Pieter Droog, who manages the job search and training center ProNet near the Reno airport. Wilson said he hopes that his experience working with a local mining company will make him attractive to Tesla or one of its future suppliers, in part because the electric car batteries will be made with lithium, which is mined in Nevada. Halfway across the country in Tennessee, Randy Robinette also drafted a letter to Tesla in the days after the deal was made. Robinette, who lived in Reno for eight years until 2005, specializes in human resources - and he figures Tesla will need plenty of help with that as it moves to hire and provide benefits for 6,500 people. He's planning a trip west in the next month or two. "I'm going to check out the Reno market in terms of housing and everything, and perhaps migrate over to the California office to see if I can get an appointment," the 58-year-old said. In Washoe County, where Reno is located, public school officials held hasty meetings to plan for a possible influx of new children. Critics question the state's decision to throw so much money at Tesla, ending tax-incentive programs for the film industry that had helped the Las Vegas area, along with incentives for the insurance industry. "The process moved very quickly and we really questioned whether lawmakers had time to look at expected benefits of the deal and what the potential risks were," said Andy Matthews, president of the free market Nevada Policy Research Institute. "How are taxpayers protected if Tesla's business product does not succeed?" Started by Elon Musk, an early PayPal investor and founder of the private space travel company Spacex, Tesla Motors is based in Palo Alto, California, and employs about 6,000 people, according to its website. Its cars are built in the San Francisco suburb of Fremont. Tesla said it lost $62 million in the second quarter, when they delivered 7,579 vehicles. The company says it's on track to deliver 35,000 cars by the end of 2014. A Tesla Model S retails for $71,070, according to the Tesla website. Storey County officials say they don’t want residential development near the site, a decision that means residents, business owners and local authorities in nearby Reno, Sparks and Fernley will likely be big beneficiaries of the jobs and money brought to town by Tesla. "Our grocery stores are going to do well. Our clothing stores are going to do well," said Reno mayor Bob Cashell. "They're going to live here." Cashell views his town as the last outpost of a megalopolis that begins 220 miles away in San Francisco, and includes Sacramento and Reno. Many residents once lived in the San Francisco Bay Area or in Sacramento, and in its heyday Reno relied on visitors from the most populous U.S. state to gamble in its casinos. But as in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, casinos in Reno declined as gaming became legal in other places, dropping from 25 percent of the economy to about 8 percent, said Mike Kazmierski, president of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada. "Our casino gaming industry has stabilized and they are slowly coming out of the recession, but they will not return to the levels they were at years ago when Nevada was the only state where you could gamble legally," Kasmierski said. At dusk on a recent weeknight, Reno's trademark neon sign glowed pink and gold, standing out against the blue-gray sky like a living painting. But few people were out, and several casinos looked as if they could use a paint job. The biggest action was at a new hotel, the Whitney Peak, which has no casino and features a climbing wall where guests can hoist themselves up the side of the building in the neon glow. John Nielsen, 48, felt the decline of gaming here when he lost his job as an engineer with a slot machine company. He hopes there will be a job for him in the new Reno, but with two sons to support and the Tesla plant's opening at least two years away, Nielsen fears any boom will come too late for him. “I see Tesla as being a fantastic employer in the future,” said Nielsen, who is considering looking for work in other states. “I don’t see it as doing anything for me right now.” (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein, editing by John Pickering) FREE AppDownload
