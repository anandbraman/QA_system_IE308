ReutersThe decline in Chinese pork prices continues. After falling 5.5% year-over-year in March, pork prices fell 6.5% in April in the world's largest pork market. On a monthly basis, pork prices were down 6.1% in April, compared with 9.1% the previous month. Oversupply has been one of the biggest factors behind the decline in pork prices. Bank of America's Ting Lu previously attributed the decline to four key reasons: Sow breeding inventory being at historically high levels.  No cases of swine flu affecting supply, despite the dead pigs found floating in Chinese rivers.  Pork demand being impacted by the government's crackdown on corruption, 'gift giving', and excesses that have hit the catering industry and high-end restaurants.  A decline in corn prices, a key feed grain for pigs.  Recently two farmers were arrested after they sold 40 tonnes of diseased pork over a three month span. The South Morning China Post reported that they had been hired by Fujian province's government to dispose of pigs that had died from pseudoradbies or the "highly infectious" blue-ear pig disease. It is unclear if instances like this or that of the dead floating pigs will have any impact on pork demand. The hog-to-corn price ratio was already below the break-even level of six earlier this year. So, Lu does expect the excess supply to decline and pork prices to pick up again in late 2013. 
Another day. Another Nikkei rally. Clockwork. Nikkei.com
The Bank of Korea just unexpectedly cut its key interest rate to 2.5% fom 2.75%. This is pretty remarkable, considering that market economists have already been surprised by two other central bank rate cuts this week. On Monday, the Reserve Bank of Australia unexpectedly lowered its key interest rate to 2.75% from 3%. Earlier Wednesday, the National Bank of Poland unexpectedly cut its key interest rate to 3% from 3.25%. These three surprise rate cuts follow two rate cuts made last week: on Thursday, the ECB cut to 0.5% from 0.75%, and on Friday, the Reserve Bank of India cut to 7.3% from 7.5%. Global growth slowdown, "currency wars," etc. â€“ call it whatever you'd like, but it seems to really be getting going now. DailyFX strategist John Kicklighter perhaps put it best in a tweet following the Bank of Korea announcement: South Korea just went in for a surprise rate cut 2.75% to 2.50%. Everyone is throwing their hat into the ring. Incredible.
ReutersChineseÂ consumer prices climbed 2.4%Â year-over-year (YoY) in April. This was just above expectations for a 2.3% rise. Meanwhile, producer prices fell 2.6% YoY. Analysts had forecast a 2.3% fall.Â  Food prices were up 4%.Â Last month we sawÂ pork pricesÂ fall 5.5%. The government has been purchasing pork for its national pork reserve to help bolster prices. China has set an inflation target of 3.5% for 2013.
The title of this post isn't a partisan statement. It actually seems to be a fact that there has been disproportionate spending particularly by more affluent democrats for about the last half year, that has given a boost to the economy.  Let me lay out my thought process. Yesterday David Atkins of Digby's blog put up a post entitled, Things are looking up for the rich as usual. He wrote that: The official unemployment rate is still hovering over 7.5%. The real unemployment and underemployment rate is far, far higher. But no worries: the Dow Jones index just shot above 15,000 for the first time today, reaching a new record high. And as it turns out, theÂ economic confidence of the wealthy is soaring.Â  Upper-income Americans' economic confidence in April pushed out of negative territory for the first time [in five years]. Middle- and lower-income Americans' economic confidence remained in negative territory at -16 in April, compared with -18 in March and -14 in February. Sure, everyone else still thinks the economy is terrible. But what do those middle-class moochers matter? The people whose homes in the Hamptons depend on a soaring stock market are doing fabulously. That's all that counts, right? Now, about 90% of the time I agree with the political material David posts. But this is a classic example of what I wrote about on Sunday, whereby some in the left blogosphere conflate "the top 20%" (in Gallup's case, at a $90,000 cutoff as we'll see below, about the top 25%) with Wall Street Brahmins like Jamie Dimon. As I noted Sunday, "the top 20%" frequently go by the names of "mom and dad." According to a recent report by the Census Bureau the median stock ownership by households age 55 to 64 is about $25,000. For households age 65 and above, the median is about $50,000.  Still, I was curious as to what he was referring, so I clicked through to find this story and this accompanying poll of economic confidence from Gallup: Gallup So the first thing I noticed is that the dividing line between upper income consumers and the rest is $90,000 annual income. David lives in southern California, so he may not be aware, but the only way somebody with a $90,000 income is getting into a home in the Hamptons is as a caterer or landscape contractor.  But the next thing that got my attention, being a total data nerd, is that big spike upward in the confidence of the lower 75% back in September 2012, that continued upward through November and seems to have had a lasting effect. So I did some searching of archived Gallup reports, and lo and behold, Gallup found a very specific reason for that spike: Because the Gallup Economic Confidence Index is based on daily tracking of consumer attitudes, we can pinpoint the day that confidence increased. That day was Sept. 4, the first night of the Democratic National Convention. [NDD note: the night of Bill Clinton's keynote address] After averaging -27 in August, and registering -28 on Sept. 3, the Gallup Economic Confidence Index jumped to -18 on Sept. 4, and has mostly remained at or near that improved level. Because Gallup Daily tracking includes political questions as well as economic ones, we can analyze whose confidence changed in an effort to understand why it changed. The data show that the rise in confidence this month has been almost exclusively due to soaring optimism among Democrats and independents who lean Democratic. And indeed, while they didn't this month, usually Gallup also includes a breakdown of economic confidence by party affiliation. Here it is from one month ago: Gallup Note that democrats have been positive about the economy since the beginning of 2012, and moreso ever since the democratic convention in September. So in fact David is wrong: "everybody else" besides the top 25% doesn't think the economy is terrible. Democrats in general are positive - a bigger determinant of being positive than having an affluent income.  And although there's no smoking gun, it seems likely that that confidence has translated into spending. Here I believe David is correct: the rising stock market is having an effect (specifically, a "wealth effect"). Anecdotally in the last few months I've heard (older middle class) people discussing how their 401(k)'s are doing - for the first time since before the great recession. And a few graphs of the S&amp;P 500 suggest that's very much the case.  First, here's a graph of the S&amp;P 500 since the bottom in March 2009: FRED But to see the reason for the wealth effect, looking at the S&amp;P 500's YoY% growth shows it better: FRED After spending 2 years barely ahead YoY, since last summer the S&amp;P has not just been rising, but it has consistently been up 10% or 20% YoY.  Finally, let's look at Gallup's latest monthly consumer spending graph: Gallup Consumer spending really started to pick up especially for higher but also for lower income consumers in late November, after the stock market had made impressive gains, as it was beginning to close in on its old 2007 records, and just after Obama got re-elected. By Gallup's measure, it has remained strong all through the first 4 months of this year, despite the payroll tax increase, and despite sequestration.  Hence the title of this post, and why it isn't a partisan comment at all. Correlation is not causation and all that, but it does seem likely that democrats, especially affluent democrats, have played a disproportionate role in boosting the economy ever since Bill Clinton's stemwinding speech on the first night of the democratic convention.
FA Insights is a daily newsletter fromÂ Business InsiderÂ that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. There Are Four Dimensions To Investing (Advisor Perspectives) Jerry Wagner of Flexible Plan Investments argues that passive investing â€“ the buy-and-hold strategy â€“ is one-dimensional investing because "holding is not a word of action." Most investors are two-dimensional investors in that they buy and sell. But he writes that there are more dimensions to investing.Â  "While passive investors often focus only on the state of the investment itself in one dimension, i.e., the factors about the investment that caused them to buy in the first place, active investors view investing in at least two dimensions. They focus on both buy and sell factors. They care whether the market environment and/or economy in general are favorable or unfavorable for stock investment as well. "Still, they differ further. Some buy and hold a long time, while others buy and hold for a short time. Two dimensional investing, then, is like a line. And that line can be long or short. "Dynamic, risk managed investing, is like a cube. Itâ€™s three dimensional. It has width, length and depth â€¦ Finally, think of each of those dynamic, risk managed investing cubes, those separate strategies, as bricks. Combine them and you have the safety of a home. Together, strategically diversified, dynamic, risk managed, investing, like your home, is intended to weather the fourth dimension â€“ time." Markets May Still Be Undervalued (Howard Lindzon via Barry Ritholtz) Howard Lindzon writes that the Internet is "gathering momentum in year 20 with the global, mobile web â€¦The internet has of course broken down old industries and exploded new ones onto the scene. My gut is the next 10 years will see more of the same but also more of a melding of everything and unique new business models both niche and scalable." He points us to Jason Calacanis' chart and says, "another spike is out there, especially in the loose global monetary world we live in today." Jason Calacanis via Howard Lindzon Three Brokerages Fined $900,000 For Inadequate Anti-Money Laundering Programs (FINRA) The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has fined three brokerages, Atlas One Financial Group LLC, Firstrade Securities Inc, and World Trade Financial Corp. $300,000. The brokerages were fined for not putting in place programs to prevent money laundering. Four executives were also fined and suspended. Whitney Tilson: The Three Most Dangerous Words In Investing (Business Insider) In his presentation for the Value Investing Congress in Las Vegas, Whitney Tilson revealed the three most dangerous words in investing: "I missed it."Â  "The 'I missed it' phenomenon is the emotional mistake of looking into a stock that's moved up a lot and, sometimes subconsciously, saying to yourself, 'Rats, I missed it' and doing no further work on it. I know people who looked at Berkshire Hathaway, after it had run from $100 to $1,000 (and $1,000, to $10,000, and $10,000 to $100,000) who fell into this trap ... "Therefore, anytime you hear yourself saying 'I missed it,' STOP! Re-do your work, ignore the historical price, and focus on the only question that matters: is the stock at today's price, an exceptionally attractive investment? If so, BUY IT!" A Fidelity Survey Suggests That Firms Looking To Hire Advisors Should Try To Impress Their Families Too (Financial Planning) A survey from Fidelity suggests that firms that want to hire away advisors that are undecided about joining them, should try to "woo" the advisor's spouse as well. The study showed that for 40% of those that switched firms, family members had encouraged the move.
APWith marijuana legal or medically available in 16 states, a new industry is rising to capitalize on the new commodity.  Interestingly, many of the entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry are finding a way to run their business without even touching the drug, which remains federally illegal. One such set of entrepreneurs is Joseph Slotin and Matt Hudson, the team behind MJCharts.com. CEO Slotin and CTO Hudson are trying to provide up-to-date historical financial data through their Cannabis Price Index. Their firm is one of the many that see billion-dollar potential in the legal marijuana business and are trying to get in at the ground floor.  Here's the transcript of our chat: Business Insider: What does MJCharts do, exactly? Hudson: So right now weâ€™re collecting and presenting all the data related to cannabis products, markets, segments, and products within those segments.  Weâ€™re interested in presenting market share data, trend visualization and then identifying pricing differentials, identifying strong brands. Weâ€™re looking to provide a resource for retailers, producers, and consumers. We feel that all of those sectors should find value from this data. BI: Where do you get the data from?  Hudson: We get the data from publicly published pricing â€” advertisements essentially â€” and we go out and scrape it. This is directly from the dispensaries, there is no black market data at all that we look at . We feel that is not very useful at this stage of the game. We have built custom spider software that reaches out to directly to stores, however they are publishing that data. BI: Are you alone? Slotin: So far we have been. Weâ€™re the only people doing historical indices on this. We haven't found anyone else doing this quite the same way â€” or at all. BI: So youâ€™re aiming to be the Bloomberg terminal for marijuana financial data? Slotin: Yeah, Iâ€™d agree with that. Absolutely. Weâ€™ve always looked at MarketWatch.  Hudson: Weâ€™re definitely taking the financial approach to presenting the information. rather than the educational or social approach.  BI: What are your backgrounds? Slotin: Iâ€™ve owned a few companies and worked in some finance and business. Iâ€™ve had some startups. I was also a medical marijuana patient for a number of years â€“ still am â€” so I kind of identified a need here as the industry moves forward. Hudson: Iâ€™ve worked in the tech sector for the better part of a decade. I have a background in system administration and web development. Iâ€™m always had an interest in data gathering and data visualization, so this project presented a perfect opportunity for me in that regard. BI: What was the process like getting started? Slotin: Well after our initial meeting in December we decided when we were gonna do this I went out to go and look for funding. We got a small amount of start-up funding and we got it working. Weâ€™re hoping to branch out and explore partnerships with businesses in the peripheral industry â€” clinics, garden supply, dispensaries, testing labs. Hudson: We hope to be able to provide consulting expertise because of our unique views of the market data. So we would hope to be able to answer questions for the growers, like what products to produce or what products to stock on their shelves, to see what other businesses are doing. BI: How long do you think it will be before the marijuana industry will be considered a serious investment? Slotin: People are already starting to dabble a little bit, but seriously throwing money at it? Itâ€™s moving forward, but Iâ€™m looking at one to five years for people to really get into it. I think forfeiture laws are the real obstacle here.  So when the federal government decides to let states do what states do, I think that will have a huge influence. I think statistics and polls [are] showing a political and social change with regards to marijuana and cannabis in general. Things are moving. BI: What are asset forfeiture laws and why do they make marijuana a risky investment? Hudson: Currently the way federal laws are written, a business that engaged in touching cannabis at a primary level is still technically subject to federal forfeiture laws.  That means the federal government can confiscate assets including real estate, bank accounts, and it makes it more perilous for people to go into the business. BI: As an industry what makes marijuana businesses different than regular businesses? Slotin: I donâ€™t think there is any real difference. It really comes down to antiquated systems at this point and just moving forward. I donâ€™t see the marijuana entrepreneur being any different than the anyone else selling any legal, recreational substance.  Itâ€™s just about normalization at this point and weâ€™re moving forward pretty quickly. Gallup poll puts out a stat every year about how Americans feel about federal and state marijuana laws. About two and a half years ago that tipped the scale towards legalization. The hold outs are the people 80 years and older and some southern states. Normalization is happening. Hudson: Youâ€™ve got more risk takers in the marijuana industry. People who are comfortable working with state law and not necessarily working with federal law. Thereâ€™s certainly a risk-taking aspect and itâ€™s certainly a high-risk investment with regards to federal law. But, we expect to see that change, thatâ€™s changing Slotin: Weâ€™d love to see some people who can afford to take those risks jump in and help to push it forward. That would hopefully make a difference. BI: So at the moment itâ€™s high risk, high reward. Slotin: Iâ€™ve seen numbers all the way up to a $50 billion industry, but itâ€™s hard to measure that because the black market is just a huge part of that too. Hudson: Thatâ€™s where we come in. Weâ€™re measuring it and weâ€™re publishing what we find. We hope that data helps speed up this normalization process in terms of presenting the facts about whatâ€™s going on out there in the industry.
Reuters/ Mike SegarHedge fund hot-shot David Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, gave his big investment idea at the Sohn Conference.Â  He's the last speaker of the day.Â  He opened with a joke, "Welcome to day two of the Sohn Conference." Â  His investment pick is going long Oil States International, a low cost drilling provider. Â  Barry Rosenstein's JANA Partners also has a stake in OIS. When JANA filed its 13D someone at Greenlight asked Einhorn if Rosenstein was speaking at Sohn. The stock is up more than 2.9% in after-hours trading. He says OIS is low cost, highly mobile and it has 34 rigs. Â It has lower than average growth margins, he added. Einhorn said that OIS's tubular services, where it's a market leader, are cheap relative to its competitors. Â He said that this business drags down the value of the company as a whole. He added that OIS offshore segment is also undervalued. Last year at Sohn, Einhorn slammed Martin Marietta Materials. The stock is up about 56% since then, though.

BTIG It's May again, so that means you can't turn on financial TV without being bombarded with advice to dump all your stocks until the end of the summer when it's safe to buy them again. This advice, "Sell in May and go away," is based on analyses of average market performance by month over the past 50 years. As you would expect (based on the aphorism), and as you can see in this chart, May has tended to be a weak month for stock performance, though stocks have still delivered a positive return in the month. June has been negative. July and August, meanwhile, have been good. September has been the real disaster. All other months, with the exception of February, have been strongly positive. So if, on average, June has seen negative returns and September has seen very negative returns, should you sell your stocks now and go away? Absolutely not. Unless you don't care about the tax and transaction costs you will incur by whipping in and out of the market, you should just sit tight. For one thing, the magnitude of the average losses in June and September, about -0.2% and -0.5%, respectively, is hardly even worth mentioning (and certainly not worth the tax and transaction cost and hassle of selling and buying again). Second, even if the market drops after you sell, you'll never know when to get back in again. (It's not as though a stop light turns from green to red to tell you when it's time to buy). Third, just because on average the market has declined in June and September over the past 50 years doesn't mean that it will again this year. And if the market doesn't decline, and you have dumped your stocks, you'll never know when to get back in again. To be clear: The market may well crash in June (or this afternoon, for that matter). It may crash 20%-50% and not regain today's highs for years. It may turn out that "sell in May and go away" will be spectacular advice this year and that you'll feel like an absolute fool for not doing having followed it. But that, unfortunately, goes with the territory. You can't buy stocks without assuming the risk that they could crash at any time. And although the folks on financial TV might have you think otherwise, no one will ever be able to tell you reliably when stocks might crash. So if you're scared of a crash, you will never be comfortable buying or owning stocks. The good news is that, over the long haul--many years--stocks should do okay. They should also do better than bonds, which are currently delivering very low yields. So if you're a long-term investor--in which case the concept of "selling in May and going away" is even more senseless--you should feel okay owning stocks. They will never be "safe" investments, but over the long haul, they should do okay. Aaron Task and I discussed this and the market in general on Yahoo's Daily Ticker today. We talked about stocks vs. bonds and the market's "real" valuation. Watch here &gt;
Tesla crushed earnings and revenue expectations, when it reported after the closing bell today. The stock initially surged on the announcement, but the buying frenzy isn't over. The stock is up a whopping 27% in after hours.  Here's a look at the after-hours action via MarketWatch. Marketwatch
CNBC screencapJim Chanos believes in the mobile revolution, and that means the death of the PC and all the businesses that exist within the PC family. At the annual Sohn Investing Conference today, he focused on one branch of that family (which he identified as value traps, of course) in a presentation called, Mobile Computing Revolution: Collateral Damage in Hard Disk Drives. "Most people have way too much storage as it is on their laptops and desktops," he explained. "The move to the cloud is actually more efficient... The amount of storage out there still exceeds the needs as fast as data is growing." In short, no one needs hard drives anymore. Companies like Samsung are exiting the business as quickly as they can. In fact, he pointed out, Samsung sold their disk drive business to his short pick at half of revenues in 2011 — the short pick is Seagate. He mentioned another company, Western Digital, in his presentation as well, but he particularly focused on Seagate because it's exhibiting all the characteristics of a classic Chanos short.  First off, there are, of course, accounting issues. It wouldn't be a Chanos short if there weren't. Seagate put about $1 billion of goodwill on the books after its Samsung acquisition, which can be great way to mask cash flow problems. Not only that, but the top 3 person in the company quit last night. And if this isn't enough for you, Chanos put up a table that shows that the top Seagate stock holders are selling like crazy. "I think it'd probably be best if you did too," he closed. The stock was trading at $42.32, and is now down 3.36% in after hours trading.
Julia La Roche for Business InsiderInvestors are gathered at Lincoln Center in Manhattan Wednesday for the highly-anticipated 18th annual Sohn Investment Conference. Some of the world's top hedge fund managers shared their investment picks and views at the event thatÂ benefits the treatment of pediatric cancer and other childhood illnesses.  The speaker lineup included, Kyle Bass (Hayman Capital), Jeff Gundlach (DoubleLine), Bill Ackman (Pershing Square), Jim Chanos (Kynikos), David Einhorn (Greenlight) and Paul Singer (Elliott Management), just to name a few. Below is our live-blog of the conference. "To call all of the countries I metnioned insolvent one has to accept that long term entitlement programs are... debt." Reducing these obligations has been virtually impossible in these countries. They are contractual and legislative.  But now governments need to come up with progrowth policies themselves. The problem is an absence of political will. "At what point...does confidence in the management of the countries and the money disappear?" Especially we're going to confront these entitlement obligations that are "utterly unpayable." It's fueling class warfare and its a "poisonous atmosphere." "This is one of the sad elements of this distortion." He thinks DXM's equity will be trading 5x more in three years.&nbsp; He showed "Japanese Finance Minister Index" in one of his first slides. That got a laugh from the audience.&nbsp; Bass showed an illustration of Haruhiko Kuroda with a slide saying there's a "new sheriff in town." &nbsp;He says the quantitative analysis is done in his opinon. &nbsp;He says it's a question of when, not if. &nbsp;&nbsp; Bass thinks the beginning of the end for Japan has already begun. &nbsp;He gave a timeline of zero to three years. &nbsp; He doesn't have a slidedeck.   He especially likes infrastructure assets. He also wants to invest in companies that can take advantage of today's low interest rates. Lastly, he likes consolidating industries. An indsutry that plays into all those themese are data carriers. And we can see that the theme in this space is that as economies scale, these businesses are consolidating. They're roughly the same size, stock price. Level 3 is overleveraged, TW is under. TW executes well and is a predictable story with predictable returns. Level 3 is more high risk. Both have "great assets and great scale." As for TW, 80% of revenue comes from carrying data. He loves that bc it's an axpanding business.&nbsp; $TWTC has grown revenue for 34 straight quarters, churn is less than 1%. They'd love that. Also, consider that these are fixed cost businesses, so if you merge you lower those costs. Ultimately, TW is a $38 value, says Meister. His price target for Level 3 $34 "now that the balance sheet isn't in question"  Pershing Square owns almost 30 million shares of P&amp;G.&nbsp; He said they think it's one of the "great businesses" in the world. &nbsp;He said it's vastly under-earning relative to its intrinsic earnings power.&nbsp; He says P&amp;G has strong brands. &nbsp;He pointed out that the company has emerging market exposure. &nbsp;He said it's probably the biggest emerging market company in the world. Ackman says that the company has talent, too.&nbsp; He said the other board memberships suck up about 25% of McDonald's time.&nbsp; He also hates Bernanke's monetary policy.  He think we're now at the end of a big super cycle that started ten years ago. The boom was weird, the downturn makes more sense. You want to own companies and currencies that don't depend on commondities and you want growth over value. His presentation is called "Housing: A Tale of Two Countries." U.S. v Canada.&nbsp; He's extremely positive on U.S. housing. He says the anticipate EPS to grow significantly over the next several years. &nbsp; "To me, it's perhaps the most powerful counter intuitive play on housing." &nbsp;He added that it's the "most levered way" to play housing. &nbsp; The key &mdash; cash flow, he says.&nbsp; He's talking about the structure of Canada's mortgage market.&nbsp; Eisman is comparing Canadian v U.S. housing prices. &nbsp;An increase in housing prices in Canada cannot be explained by a growth in personal income, he says. &nbsp; He said Canadian banks have been hard at work expanding mortgage credit. &nbsp; He said Canadian banks run a very large domestic funding gap of $426 billion.&nbsp; He said the CMHC and NHA securitization market have filled this gap. &nbsp; "When something gets that big, even governments get nervous," he said. &nbsp;Now banks have to fund mortgages on their own and they're no longer guaranteed, he added. The lending practices of the boom have made them even riskier. He believes there's been wide-spread fraud as borrowers under report their living expenses and lenders are complicit in this. Retailers are offering unsecured credit to bump up sales as well. However, they experience cred deterioration faster than banks. Some retailers are beginning to see this already, while Stiemerman believes the rest of the country's credit is just about to turn. He called Paul Singer a Piker! He says that hard disk drive manufacturers appear "cheap", but are "value traps. &nbsp;He cited Western Digital and Seagate Technology.&nbsp; He says the Thailand floods created unsustainable hard disk drive profitability.&nbsp; He says there are accounting issues. &nbsp;The No. 3 guy Bob Whitmore, the CTO, left the company last night. &nbsp; The company he's short is Digital Realty Trust.&nbsp; It trades at $68.50/share.  Then the banking panic happened, Roosevelt blamed the economic crisis on bankers and he spent like crazy in his first 100 days. "The country needs and demands bold and persisitant experimentation," he wrote.  Kind of like how the EU experimented with Cyprus, Gundlach points out. And he thinks Cyprus could happen again. "Like the Lusitania was just one boat." This isn't so much strange, but what he DOES think is amazing is the rise of the ETF. Also, he says, T Bonds are not over owned.  The high end, he points out, is killing it, while the bottom is suffering. However, drilling is only 5% of precorporate EBITDA for OIS. It also has a completion services business which basically preps sites for drilling (making the safe etc.). OIS has great products in the market and 40-50% of its rental tools are proprietary or patented. There's also a tubular services business (casing and production), where it is a market leader. But this business drags down the value of the company as a whole, Einhorn believes, and is one of the reasons the market values it.

Business InsiderIndia's bureaucracy has repeatedly been named the worst in Asia. In fact the term bureaucracy is often used synonymously with corruption in India, while it other parts of the world it refers more to red tape. So it's fascinating and wonderful to see a magazine focused entirely on bureaucracy with the fantastically blunt title "bureaucracy today." Jump to Bureaucracy Today &gt; Bureaucracy Today was launched in March 2009 by Suhaib A Ilyasi, who famously launched a television show called India's Most Wanted in 1999. The magazine claims to have a readership of over 600,000. Its website also declares that its readers are responsible for over 70% of India's GDP. The magazine costs Rs. 50 (about $0.93). So, we decided to get a copy of the publication and look through it to see what's inside. The magazine was nearly impossible to find in Mumbai, the nation's financial capital. Every news vendor and book store I visited stared back at me quizzically. A friend tracked down a copy in Delhi, home to India's political capital, New Delhi, and brought it with her to Mumbai. I expected the magazine to have at least one investigative piece, considering its subhead reads "fearless journalism, our habit, our history!" That isn't however what I found inside. Instead it's a very straightforward take on the latest things happening in Bureaucracy. An Indian Express article published almost a year after Bureaucracy Today's launch dubbed it and other magazines centered on bureaucracy "feelgood journalism for the babu." When used in the pejorative 'babu' refers to a corrupt bureaucrat.
YouTube / Margin Call TrailerIâ€™m a money manager with roots in policy economics. I worked at the US Treasury under both a Republican and a Democratic administration. I did a tour of duty at the International Monetary Fund as well. For most of the 90s, I was a sovereign debt specialist/negotiatorâ€”when emerging market debt crises were the center of the financial universe. Since then, Iâ€™ve managed real money and fast money, mostly focusing on global macro. As a result I come at markets from both the perspective of a policy guy and a market guy, which all too often is like oil and water. My initial grounding was in sovereign credit risk and global fixed income. I am very active in currencies. When I first came to the markets, I was taken aback by how superficial the marketâ€™s understanding of economics was. Not stupid, but superficial in the most neutral sense of the word. This was particularly true in emerging markets. It seemed that guys would have a hunch, based on price action or intuition, and then would reverse engineer a story that to them would explain what they saw or felt. In other words: the conclusion comes first and the investment hypothesis would then follow. But these guys made moneyâ€”at least, for the most part. To me, this did not compute. How did guys who didnâ€™t even understand basic macroeconomic identities or dynamics successfully manage money? I was highly skeptical of EMH (the Efficient Market Hypothesis) well before I came to the markets. But from my first contact with animal spirits I realized that I had still vastly overestimated manâ€™s abilities to be that textbook rational maximizer of utility. All this got me thinking and reading. I started to consume books on technical analysis and, importantly, behavioral economicsâ€”a discipline that didnâ€™t exist when I went to grad school. A conclusion soon started to emerge: good risk management was far more important than good ideas in money management (more on this later). And a good understanding of market psychology, positioning, and technical analysis were central to risk management. Exploring the growing literature on behavioral economics and finance also helped me put labels on the many ways in which the standard economic and financial models failed capture the actual behavior of economic agents. This was hugely liberating. By identifying the systematic ways in which the efficient market logic fell short, it validated much of what I was observing. The implications for the reigning ideology of the past 30 years of free, equilibrating, self-regulating markets were profound. The aspiration of this blog is not to cure the world of cognitive biases. Rather, by trying to put global macro issues and markets in a more behavioral context, the hope would be that we might be able to better recognize situations in which our biases are likely to surface so that weâ€”whether as analyst or risk takerâ€”can make that extra effort to try to avoid the systematic pitfalls inherent in the human condition. Not everything will have a behavioral angle to it either; I intend to splash down ideas wherever I think my background might lend itself to insight into current economics, finance, or politics. In recent months I have become fairly active on Twitter (@mark_dow), and in recent years I have written articles and guest-blogged from time to time. But writing in my own blog is a new experience, one I am likely to take a step at a time. Not sure how it will go, or how often Iâ€™ll post. So, for those interested, please bear with me while I work things out. Editor's note: this post originally ran on Mark Dow's blog on May 12, 2012.
Robert Scoble / FlickrTesla reported adjusted earnings of $0.12 per share, This beat expectations of $0.03 per share. Sales were up 83% from the last quarter, to $562 million. This is Tesla's first profitable quarter. The stock is up over 13% in after hours. Tesla reaching profitability so quickly provides proof that if you build vehicles that not only look great but are enjoyable to drive, consumers will purchase them,â€ said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book in an email. But he goes on to write that, "While Tesla has found success in the premium luxury segment, even surpassing sales volume of the more affordable Chevrolet Volt, they will run into the same difficulties faced by Chevrolet, Nissan, and others in trying to sell an electric vehicle to mainstream consumers that will find it more difficult to pay the premium prices associated with electric vehicles." The company expects to build over 5,000 model S units in Q1, and expects to build another 5,000 in Q2. It also expects 21,000 deliveries in 2013, up from 20,000. Looking ahead Elon Musk said he plans to spend $200 million on capital expenditures in 2013. Last month, Tesla founder Elon Musk introduced a new auto-financing scheme that would allow buyers to sell back their Tesla's for some minimum price. While Tesla's sales target of 20,000 vehicles this year may be achievable, The Wall Street Journal points out that the thing to watch for is what's behind the company's margin. They argue that much of the margin is driven by government subsidies and that it could vanish if the government changed its plans. But tech tweeter @SammyWalrusIV reports that Elon Musk has hit back at the WSJ's claim. He cites Musk saying that the gross margin doesn't assume zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credit revenue from the government. Click here for the full release.
The company also posted EPS of $0.93 beating estimates by $0.20. Revenue of $1 billion, a 14% increase, was in-line. Trading in Green Mountain has been halted on the announcement. Here's the full release: SEATTLEÂ &amp; WATERBURY, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Â Starbucks Coffee CompanyÂ (NASDAQ: SBUX), the worlds largest coffee retailer,Â and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. (GMCR) (NASDAQ: GMCR), a leader in specialty coffee and coffeemakers,Â haveÂ signedÂ an agreement that provides for the expansion of their successful partnership for the manufacturing, marketing, distribution,Â and sale ofÂ Starbucks- and Tazo-branded single serveÂ packs for use inÂ GMCRs KeurigÂ®Â single serve brewing systems globally. Starbucks and GMCR first entered into partnership inÂ March 2011. Following a very successful product launch, Starbucks has shipped more thanÂ 850 millionÂ StarbucksÂ® coffee K-CupÂ® packs. Todays announcement recognizes the tremendous success of the Starbucks and GMCR strategic relationship, and both companies desire to broaden, deepen and significantly extend their partnership. TheÂ new, minimum five-yearÂ agreementÂ announced today is a global single-serve coffee industry game changer. Under the new agreement, Starbucks will add brands and varietals to the already robust StarbucksÂ® K-CupÂ® and VueÂ® pack portfolioÂ ofÂ offerings for KeurigÂ® single cup brewers, ultimately triplingÂ theÂ number ofÂ StarbucksÂ®Â products and adding brands offeredÂ onÂ the KeurigÂ®Â platform. New brands will include Seattles Best CoffeeÂ®, TorrefazioneÂ ItaliaÂ® coffee, TeavanaÂ® Teas, and StarbucksÂ® Cocoa. The new agreement reinforces Starbucks position asÂ theÂ exclusive licensed super premium coffee brand on the KeurigÂ® K-CupÂ®Â and VueÂ® platforms, and further extends the KeurigÂ® systems position as theÂ exclusiveÂ low-pressureÂ single cup brewing systemÂ for fresh-brewed StarbucksÂ® coffee,Â TazoÂ®Â tea and the aforementioned Starbucks brands.Â Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Starbucks new agreement with GMCR strengthensÂ ourÂ leadership position in the premium single cup category, the segment of our industry that has grown nine times faster than the overall coffee category during the past year and a category that now accounts for more than 25 percent of total coffee sales in grocery, saidÂ Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman, president and ceo. The new agreement also affords us the opportunity toÂ expandÂ ourÂ successful K-CupÂ® and VueÂ® pack portfolio of products and brandsÂ beyondÂ North AmericaÂ and to market them on a trulyÂ global scale over time. It's a win-win-win agreement for both companies and for premium coffee consumers around the world. Going forward, notÂ only will StarbucksÂ continue to leverage GMCRs growing installed KeurigÂ® brewer base totaling millions of North American households, butÂ GMCR will directly benefit from the many Starbucks brand assets we bring to bear on theÂ coffee marketplace as it pursues global expansion of its business and platform. With steady, strong consumer adoption, our innovative KeurigÂ® brewing system has proven to be a disruptive technology for the hot beverage category, providing consumers the benefits of convenience, consistent great taste and importantly beverage variety, while providing our partner brands a valuable channel for growth. This agreement further strengthens our North American partnership with Starbucks and expands our relationship to explore global single-serve opportunities, saidÂ Brian P. Kelley, GMCRs President and CEO.

">wolfsavard via FlickrIn 2011, two former finance executives Sam Lundin and Chris Yeung left their jobs to start a company. They moved into startup incubator WeWork Labs and bootstrapped Vimbly, an activity-booking platform. Now they've raised their first bit of outside capital, $540,000 from ten angel investors. On Vimbly, you can find everything from trapeze classes in New York City to sword swallowing to cooking classes at the Institute of Culinary Education. It was recently featured as a Mother's Day gift-finding solution on CBS. Investors include professionals at Apax Partners, Deutsche Bank, and Macquarie Capital Advisors. Lundin and Yeung worked for Perry Capital and BlackRock respectively. The pair met at Cornell University and founded Vimbly after Lundin conducted a painful search for a local photography class. Vimbly shows activities on a map of New York, and allows users to search by date, price range and more. It's similar to TechStars company Classtivity and education startup, Course Horse but with the search experience of Expedia. Right now, Vimbly is only available in New York, but the founders say the funding will help them expand to five markets, including Boston and Washington, D.C. There are 5,000 activities on the site.

Bloomberg TV screenshotA big hedge fund event, the Ira Sohn Investment Conference, is happening today. At the event, industry luminaries present their favorite investment ideas, and often deliver some kind of macro thesis. One big theme: Bernanke hate. A lot of the big guys HATE him. Stanley Druckenmiller calls current Fed policy totally outrageous and inappropriate! Paul Singer says the Fed is creating class warfare! They're not alone. If you listen to a lot of old industry veterans, you'll hear a lot of grousing about Bernanke and QE and all that jazz. Basically, they sound like your typical comments section on a blog. Why? We talked to trader Mark Dow who sent us his thoughts on the matter. He writes: Some guys don't understand monetary policy and think he's doing wrong thing. Others think it's immoral that markets aren't let to clear (meaning, collapse to a point where someone will swoop in and just by). Others are pissed because they missed rally so they blame Bernanke as the exogenous factor that made them wrong. Like "if not for this STUPID policy I'd be making money." None of those decisively get at the matter. Via email, Princeton economist Paul Krugman tells BI: I don't really know, although at some level I'm not surprised: finance types just hate, hate easy money policies, although you would think that these policies are often good for their bottom lines. I do wonder in this case whether there's extra hatred of Bernanke because he keeps proving them wrong: they keep predicting terrible things from QE, runaway inflation, and all that,and instead the bearded academic stuff keeps turning out right. So it seems to be a combination of things. Hedge funds are doing badly in this rising-tide-lifts-all-boats market, and they feel that they would be outperforming if the Fed just let things collapse, and they could swoop in when prices "clear." The inflation and hyperinflation fantasies are another important aspect here. A lot of these guys cut their teeth during the 80s, when inflation was the enemy, and Volcker was a hero for fighting it. Thus being anti-inflation is kind of a nostalgia trip for them. Also in general, the older people are, the more worried they are about inflation. Also the older people are, the more they are inclined to invest in bonds and risk-free assets, so low rates aren't fun.
Legendary hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller is presenting at the Sohn Investment Conference today. His comments are quite bearish on the commodity complex. Druckenmiller says the supply and demand situation in commodities is deadly (various commodity markets are dealing with supply gluts even as global growth is slowing), and he recommends shorting "commodity currencies" â€“ like the Australian and Canadian dollars. The last two years, Druckenmiller says, have shown that the commodity supercycle is over. "The commodity supercycle is over. It is not a correction. Own currencies that benefit from LOWER commodities." - Druckenmiller #irasohn Druckenmiller says short Australia on commodity bust. "we think australian dollar will come down and come down hard" #sohn2013 #nyp Druckenmiller #sohn2013: â€œSupply-demand situation for commodities is deadly.â€
Earlier today we looked inside Indian magazine Bureaucracy Today. One of our favorite sections of the magazine was the Horoscope for Bureaucrats. This involves both professional and personal readings. Aquarius was one of our favorites: "April will be an interesting month for bureaucrats from the professional angle. You will remain vibrant and there will be lots of activity at [the] work place. New opportunities will be knocking at your doorstep. [The] Office environment will be quite favourable. Financial gains will continue throughout the month. The success of your child in getting admission abroad for higher education will be a source of pleasure." So is Pisces: "April will be a favorable month for bureaucrats from the professional angle. You will get much needed respite from mental tension. You will regain confidence and will find the road ahead easy to negotiate. You will get the support of your peers and superiors and will surge ahead with optimism. You will be in a position to give physical dimensions to some of your plans. Planets also indicate financial gains. You may plan buying jewelry or a new vehicle. There will be total harmony on the domestic front." Business Insider
APMILAN (AP) â€” An appeals court has upheld the tax fraud conviction against ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi and sentenced him to four years in prison. But the former Italian leader could appeal this verdict to a higher court, the Court of Cassation. In October, a court convicted Berlusconi in a scheme that involved inflating the price his Mediaset media empire paid for TV rights to U.S. movies and pocketing the difference. Berlusconi denied the charges and says he's a victim of politically motivated prosecutors. That verdict was upheld Wednesday by the appeals court in Milan. The lower court, which began hearing the case in 2006, also said Berlusconi could not hold public office for five years or manage any company for three years, penalties that would take force only if the conviction is upheld on two levels of appeal.

Former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling has reached a deal with federal prosecutors to get out of prison a decade before his 24-year prison sentence is up. Under the deal Skilling â€” who was convicted of fraud for his role in the collapse of Enron â€” would get out of prison in 2017, the Justice Department announced. Skilling has agreed to forfeit more than $40 million and give up the right to appeal his conviction. A Justice Department spokesman said the deal ensures Skilling is "appropriately punished" and that Enron victims get restitution. A judge will have to sign off on the deal. Skilling has served six years of his sentence so far. In October 2006, Skilling got the 24-year sentence for his role in the massive accounting fraud that caused Enron's downfall. Since he was sentenced, both of his parents and his college-age son have died. The proposed deal comes after an appeals court ruled in 2009 that Skilling's 24-year sentence was excessive. Skilling was never resentenced because of procedural delays, though, and Skilling's lawyers have been planning to ask for a retrial because of alleged misconduct ofÂ  Enron Task Force prosecutors. CNBC has pointed out that a deal to cut his sentence could help prosecutors avoid another trial, which would dig into those allegations of misconduct.
Reuters/ Lucas JacksonActivist investor Bill Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, spoke at the Sohn Investment Conference moments ago. He's gave a bullish case on Procter &amp; Gamble.   Pershing Square owns almost 30 million shares of P&amp;G.  He said they think it's one of the "great businesses" in the world. He said it's vastly under-earning relative to its intrinsic earnings power.  Last year at Sohn, Ackman pitched going long JCPenney.  The stock has fallen about 35% since then.   Check here for full conference coverage &gt;
Daily TickerNouriel Roubini was just on CNBC, broadcasting live from the SALT Conference in Las Vegas. Roubini has been warning that we are in the midst of a new asset bubble that could end in a crash bigger than that in 2008. However, he's playing it really safe with the market calls. CNBC anchor Scott Wapner posed the question to Roubini: "You think we have a little bit of runway left for this [upward] market move that we've seen. How long?" Roubini replied: It could go on for another year or two. Of course, there are two forces. Growth is slow. Earnings growth is also slowing down. Top line and bottom line are not as good as they used to be, but margins are high. They could correct, somehow, over time. But you have the gravitational forces of slow economy leading eventually to correction, but then the levitational forces of QEs, zero policy rates, more money coming in the market â€“Â not just from the U.S., but from other economies â€“ it's going to levitate asset prices.So, as I pointed out, this might lead to a generalized credit and equity and asset bubble in the next year or two, followed by a crash.Bu for the next year or so, as long as the economy grows 1.5-2%, and you have easy money, this market can go higher. This is a pretty standard take. Economic expansion isn't living up to expectations, but stocks keep rising anyway. Roubini's story is now pretty well hedged.
Yesterday we pointed out that on the occasion of the Dow hitting 15,000, it was still clear that people still detested this stock market rally, based on the fact that everyone screams "RIGGED" or "PONZI" or "BERNANKE" on every uptick. This is the most hated rally of all time. Since the beginning of the recovery in 2009, people have been predicting its demise. But it's not just mouth-breathing comment-section trolls can't stand to see gains. Even the pros are still agitated, and are not enjoying at all Dow 15,000. Josh Brown notes in a tweet: So far, we've heard from Paul SInger, Kyle Bass and Li Lu - not one talking about a free-trading common stock you can buy. Bullish? #irasohn Paul Singer hates the Fed. Kyle Bass hates Japanese policy-makers. Sill nobody is happy or enjoying the good times.
Kyle Bass is presenting at the Sohn Investment Conference today, and he's discussing his famous short-Japan trade. He mentioned the "Japanese Finance Minister Index." In case you're wondering what that is, below is a version from an April 2012 presentation. (After Azumi, Koriki Jojima served in the post briefly, and was succeeded by current finance minister Taro Aso. So, that now makes it 11 finance ministers in the last 6 years.) petroleumstrategies.com
youtubeKyle Bass is on his favorite topic here at the Sohn Investment Conference — Japan. His bottom line is that the country's "shock and awe" monetary policy is not going to work, and Japanese leaders are beginning to realize that. "What they're doing represents 70% of what the Fed is doing here with an economy 1/3 the size of ours," said Bass. Ultimately he says, with regards to Abenomics, is that country is a Ponzi on top of a Ponzi. He says the country is on "tilt" and he added "You have to be sh**ing me." The question is when, and that moves to "qualitative aspects," he added. What does that mean?  There's a fatalism, he says, in everyone he talks to in Japan. Their thinking is changing, and the way they talk to him about debt is changing. They already spend 50% of tax revenue on debt service. "If rates go up, it's game over."
It was technology versus education, and technology won. But that balance could be shifting, according to Feroli. First, there has been a rise in college enrollment rates, and it doesnâ€™t appear to merely be a case of young people avoiding a bad job market by heading to university. Second, the pace of technological change appears to be slowing if you measure innovation byÂ the relative prices of capital equipment. Feroli devastating data point: â€œIn the second half of the 1990s, the real price of computer equipment declined at a 24% annual rate, indicating an extremely rapid pace of increase in computing power. Over the last five years those prices have fallen at only a 6% annual pace, consistent with progress occurring at a much slower rate.â€ Feroli thinks the tide has already turnedÂ in the race between education and technology, but the deep recession and weak recovery have masked it. He finds a linkage between theÂ Gini coefficient â€” a measure of household income inequality â€” and the gap between the actual unemployment rate and the economyâ€™s natural, full-employment rate. As the economy hopefully moves back toward full employment, this alone should reduce inequality. Furthermore, if the leading explanation of inequality is correct, and recent trends in education and technological advance continue, we could see a further compression of wages. Now hereâ€™s the other side of the trade: 1. Maybe the rising cost of education will cause college attendance to slip. 2. Maybe computer equipment prices are a poor shorthand for technological progress and productivity. There is also a strong case to be made that innovation is accelerating, which I have written about frequently. 3. Maybe the tech-education explanation for inequality has less explanatory power than commonly believed. Feroli acknowledges all of the above, but still concludes â€œthat the next few years have the best chance in a generation to witness a narrowing in income inequality.â€ Now the reason that might be a good thing is that American society, particularly on the lower-income end, has beenÂ buffeted by globalization and technology. Perhaps it could stands for a brief pause. Let education and the safety net catch up. Then again, I would rather deal with the technology-education race â€” which I really think is an automation versus education-entrepreneurship race â€” on the fly by making workers smarter and helpingÂ entrepreneurs to invent new ways of â€œcombining technology and people to create new industries and innovations,â€ in the words ofÂ Â techno-optimist Erik Brynjolfsson. Â Reducing inequality via less growth and less innovation and less opportunity â€” through a â€œgreat stagnationâ€ â€” seems like a lousy bargain.
World Economic Forum via FlikrBillionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who runs Elliott Management, opened the Sohn Investment Conference and his talk was pretty much a downer. Singer made the point that quantitative easing has caused a "distorted recovery." He explained that this means people who own stocks and bonds — financiers, bankers, hedge funds— are doing fine.  "Most of the people in this room are doing just fine," Singer said, adding, "The ordinary person is not experiencing the effective equivalent of Dow Jones 15,000....the average person is paying a lot of money...for the necessities of life is worried about his or her job or the job of his or her family...is experiencing an economy that has basically recession level employment." This distortion is helping to fuel class warfare, he added.   "I think that's a poisonous atmosphere in which to rely upon the private sector to generate growth," he said. He concluded that he sees no "safe haven" in investing.
The biggest mistakes made in investing are usually born out of emotional reactions to moves in the markets. In his presentation to the Value Investing Congress, Whitney Tilson addressed what he considered to be the three most dangerous words in investing: "I missed it."

This morning, Donald Trump sent out a mysterious Tweet: I'm giving away money! 11AM Trump Tower. Be there or be left behind!  Not exactly. Turns out, he was foreshadowing the launch of a new croudfunding site he's calling FundAnything.Â  At first blush, it seems to be pretty straightforward: you can choose from or set up your own project in pretty much any category, from art to medical to politics, and donate or solicit money.Â FundAnything charges a 9% fee on contributions, though when you reach your goal, youâ€™ll get 4% back for a fee of just 5%. There is also a 3% processing fee. But there's a twist. Per the site: "Some lucky campaigns will receive full or partial funding from Donald Trump." Why's he doing it? He will make an announcement later today, but this Tweet seems to sum it up: People do not assume this but more than anything else, I like helping people. Be at Trump Tower at 11 AM today.
REUTERS/Mike SegarWarren BuffettÂ served as a mentor to young professionals yesterday during an "Office Hours" session with Levo League, a networking andÂ career advice site.  During the live stream video chat, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO told women to "stop holding yourself back"Â and shared personal stories â€” including how he overcame his fear of public speaking â€” to highlight universal career lessons.  We've included a few key takeaways from Buffett's interview below:  1. Find your passion. "Never give up searching for the job that youâ€™re passionate about," he says. "Try to find the job youâ€™d have if you were independently rich. ... Forget about the pay. When youâ€™re associating with the people that you love, doing what you love, it doesnâ€™t get any better than that.â€ 2. Be careful who you look up to. "If you tell me who your heroes are, I'll tell you how you're gonna turn out. It's really important in life to have the right heroes. I've been very lucky in that I've probably had a dozen or so major heroes. And none of them have ever let me down. You want to hang around with people that are better than you are. You will move in the direction of the crowd that you associate with." 3. Learn how to communicate effectively. While he was getting his MBA from Columbia University, Buffett said that he was "terrified of public speaking," and signed up for a Dale Carnegie class, but changed his mind at the last minute. After graduating, Buffett saw the ad for the course again and decided to give it a second chance. "I became associated with the 30 other people in the class. We couldn't stand up in front of a group and say our own name. I mean it was â€” we were â€” it was pathetic.Â  But that class changed my life in a big way."Â  4. Develop healthy habits by studying people. "Pick the person that has the right habits, that is cheerful, generous, gives other people credit for what they do. Look at all of the qualities that you admire in other people ... and say to yourself, 'Which of those qualities can't I have myself?' Because you determine whether you have them. And the truth is you can have all of them." 5. Learn how to say "no." "You won't keep control of your time, unless you can say 'no.' You can't let other people set your agenda in life." 6. Don't work for someone who won't pay you fairly. "I do very little negotiation with people. And theyÂ do little with me, in terms of it ...Â if I was a woman and I thought I was getting paid considerably less than somebody else that was equal coming in, that would bother me a lot. I probably wouldn't even want to work there.Â  I mean, [if] somebody's gonna be unfair with you, in salary, they're probably being unfair with you in a hundred other ways." 7. Become involved with growing businesses. "I mean, you want to get on a train that's going to go 90 miles an hour and not one that's gonna go 30 miles an hour and you're gonna try to figure out how to, you know, push it along a little faster. So it really does make a huge difference. And there are some businesses that inherently [have] far more opportunities than others." 8. Learn everything you can about your industry. Buffett says he reads six hours every day because he believes that growing your intellectual prospective will also help you critically solve future problems that may arise. "I knew a lot about what I did when I was 20. I had read a lot, and I aspired to learn everything I could about the subject. " 9. Young women should seek male mentors. Buffett says it's important for women to have male mentors, because theÂ majority of today's leaders in the workplace are still men.  â€œThese [mentoring] relationships all just evolve. I never set out to become a mentor ... Itâ€™s amazing ... how the person that really wants to do a terrific job just jumps out. There arenâ€™t that many. You will be perceived as exceptional and as a worthy person for a superior to spend some extra time with if you just do something extra all the time. It seems elementary, but itâ€™s true.â€ At the end of his office hour, Buffett told everyone that even if they fail along the way, "the world isn't over," because "you are healthy, and bright and have decades ahead of you."

10000yearclock.netThe products that threw banks around the world into free-fall, dragging the global economy down with them, are not gone â€” they're just moving into hedge funds, Bloomberg reports. Because hedge funds are far less regulated than your average bank, they're considered a part of the shadow banking system. Additionally, because hedge funds are far less regulated than your average bank, they can pick up the assets that governments are forcing banks to get rid of â€” things like distressed corporate debt, mortgage backed securities, and all sorts of fun credit derivatives. They're picking up the traders Wall Street is being forced to get rid of as well. People on the Street have been talking about this for a while, and they, like Bloomberg, are calling it a brain drain. The thing is, all of this has been happening relatively slowly. Bloomberg says hedge funds have only picked up $108 billion of these assets since 2009, which is nothing compared to what Wall Street has on its balance sheet. JP Morgan alone had an average of $413.4 billion in trading assets in Q1, says the report. That said, however, for hedge funds, slow and stead will likely win the race. From Bloomberg: They attracted $41.4 billion from pension plans, wealthy individuals and other investors in 2012, the most since 2007, after a combined $57.4 billion of net inflows in the two previous years, HFR data show. The three-year total was a record. Hedge funds focusing on fixed-income arbitrage boosted returns by 51 percent last year, while fixed-income, currencies and commodities-trading revenue at the nine largest banks rose 14 percent, excluding accounting charges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strategy, once employed by Long-Term Capital Management LP, focuses on exploiting pricing inconsistencies between assets rather than making bets on the marketâ€™s direction at a time when Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn are predicting losses for fixed-income investors when interest rates rise. Things ended very badly for Long-Term Capital Management, but hey, it's a new day right? Bloomberg specifically mentions three hedge funds that are really leading this march, BlueCrest, Pine River Capital and Millennium Management LLC. Together they have over $67 billion in assets. You can bet governments around the world are happy about this. It means risk is being transferred away from systemically important institutions. These hedge funds have to be thrilled as well. They're making a killing off of mortgage backed securities. The best performing hedge fund of 2012 was Deepak Narulla's Metacapital Mortgage Opportunities, which returned 37.8%. Last June, Anthony Scaramucci told CNBC that Pine River was doing great things with mortgage backed securities and seeing 12% returns. Not bad, and probably getting better.
This year’s earnings for a Stay at Home Mom would be $113,000. What is supposed to make Stay at Home Moms feel validated for all their hard work in reality serves as a cruel reminder of how much Moms are still not valued in the work force or at home. Regardless of a positive April jobs report, many of these Stay at Home Moms, who left high paying jobs for a child rearing hiatus will never earn much again, when and if they are able to return to the workforce at all.   Katrina, mother of two (preferred not to have her last name published) was a former hedge fund auditor. She left her career to be at home with her two children. When she wanted to go back to work, she had no idea how difficult it would be. She had a three-year, “Mommy Gap” in her resume. It took two years to find a job. She also found she was no longer a viable candidate for re-entry at her former job level. Even as she reached out to recruiters they told her the gap was a problem. “They told me no way was I going to make what I used to make.” Katrina recently found a bookkeeping job on Craigslist that she “had to take out of desperation. It’s way below what I wanted and used to make.” She is making 60% less than she did before she left her career, but her new job offers some flexibility, which her former auditing job did not. I asked her what she thought about all the buzz around Sandberg’s theory of “Leaning In” to our careers, Katrina told me she had “Leaned in.” She pushed and reached quite a high level before she opted out. Kirstin Gaddis, MBA, and a senior marketing manager, took ten years off to raise her kids. She recently accepted a full time junior position at Ebay, She took a significant pay cut compared to what she was making ten years ago. Yet, as her kids are older, 8 and 10, she was eager to get back in. “I knew that if I waited to accept a job that I was qualified for, I would be waiting a very long time.” Instead, in her job search, she looked to good companies, where she would be able to do something interesting and eventually be able to rise up the ranks. Paulette Light is also an MBA too, and a mother of four. Pre-kids she worked as a management consultant.Paulette wrote an eloquent response on Sandberg’s website about being part of the 43% statistic of high achieving women who leave the workforce and never come back. Her essay was re-published on The Atlantic. She told me her former career didn’t translate to Motherhood. “My old company tried so hard to have me stay. It just wasn’t feasible for them to have me work 30 hours a week (when she wanted to cut back) and everyone else work 100.” She added, “It’s not that it is a conspiracy against Moms. It’s harder to be competitive.” Paulette wound up founding her own social media business, which offers business referrals to friends, many of them Moms. Starting your own business is a great solution for Moms that want to re-enter the workforce on their own terms and at a high level. But not every Mom who wants to go back to work is an MBA with skills to start her own company. Is there no other way to work within the corporate structure? Allison Kelly, founder of Mom Corps had a background in the corporate world, too. She found it difficult to balance career and family. She also knew a great deal of “amazingly talented women that companies would love to have access to.” Thus, her business was born.  Mom Corps is an employment agency specializing in providing flexible employment for Moms. What advice does she give moms who want to re-enter the workforce? She tells them “not to make excuses.” She recommends a positive attitude: “I was at home, I took time off, but now I am excited and ready to get back to work.” Yet, Allison did admit that the longer you are away from the workplace the harder it is to get back in. “Two to three years is easy to explain. If it is longer than that, women should make a good effort to take classes, do internships, volunteer.” When I asked how companies respond to the idea of flexible work? “Smaller companies tend to be more open to it.  Larger companies seem to be moving in the direction of experimenting with flexible work options, the message being, “We are trying to get there.” Michael Abelson, a partner at the Los Angeles law firm, Ableson/Herron LLP, was encouraging. He told me, “We love hiring Moms.” When he and his partner opened their own firm they had came from a larger firm where they saw a significant pool of talent, specifically Moms, be forced to “bow out of the big firm talent pool.” Women in his firm are "from the best law schools, are extremely talented, and all they ask is some modicum of flexibility.” He does not require his lawyers to be in the office on any given day. “They use their own judgment,” he said. “We hire these people for their judgment, so they do their work when they need to do it, and they are able to manage their responsibilities at home…These women are professionals who care about their jobs.” Ableson is surprised that more companies have not caught on. He went on to say, “To think that a company would waste such talent by not offering support or flexibility blows my mind.” In honor of Mother’s Day this year, instead of flowers or chocolates or a chart highlighting her “fictitious” wages, how about giving a Mom a job? A real one, that pays her well and gives her a true sense of what she’s actually worth.
Bloomberg TVDemocrats are seizing on an admission from House Speaker John Boehner that a Republican-led bill to prioritize debt payments would pay China before U.S. troops.Â  During an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, Boehner was asked about the Full Faith and Credit act, which is expected to come to a House vote this week. The bill would prioritize the nation's payments in the event it hits the debt ceiling. It would direct the U.S. Treasury to pay bondholders to avoid immediate default. Democrats have said that the strategy would force the U.S. to pay China before its own troops. When Bloomberg's Peter Cook asked Boehner about Democrats' suggestions, he did not dismiss them. "Those who have loaned us money, like in any other proceeding, if you will â€” the bondholders usually get paid first. Same thing," Boehner said.Â  Cook followed up and asked Boehner if he was worried about the politics of that strategy. "Not at all," Boehner said. "I just think itâ€™s another tool that we can use to help impress upon the administration if it comes to the point where they donâ€™t have enough money to pay all the bills, hereâ€™s some order that we think is sound." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office blasted out the clip of Boehner Wednesday morning, adding that Boehner candidly admitted that the bill would force payments to China before troops, veterans, and doctors and hospitals that treat Medicare patients. A Senate Democratic aide told Business Insider that the proposal would be a non-starter in the Senate if it passes the House. The White House has also threatened to veto the legislation.Â  Still, the aide was surprised that Boehner would employ this strategy at all. "The message of the bill is terrible and no one takes it seriously as a piece of legislation, since it's a nonstarter in the Senate and the President would veto it in any event," the aide said. "Doing nothing would probably be smarter for them than doing this bill." The U.S. isn't expected to need to raise its debt limit until October, according to some recent estimates.Â  Here's the clip of Boehner discussing the bill on Tuesday: 
Manchester United shares are off to a rough start this morning following news that Alex Ferguson will resign as manager of the club, a post he took in 1986. The stock fell as low as $17.73 â€“ down 5.5% â€“ shortly after the opening bell in New York. It has since bounced back a bit and is currently trading at $18.38, down 2.1%. Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson highlights the story in a note today (it's a pretty slow week) and warns that shares could see rising volatility ahead: The 2012 IPO raised $233 million by slicing off a small chunk of the 135-year old team at $14.00 per share. At the time of the IPO Soros Fund Management took a $47.5mm stake in the company buying 3.397mm shares, which if still owned would be worth $63.78mm. Soros Fund Management remained a holder as at the end of December 2012 according to its 13F filing. In a 2010 debt offering the prospectus cited the potential departure of Fergie as a risk factor that might put into jeopardy the success of the club, highlighting the instability of investments in sports franchises revolving around specific individuals. While Sir Alex is heading from the dressing room to the boardroom, he leaves behind a lucrative trophy cabinet containing 13 Premier League titles, two European Cup victories, five FA cup wins and four League Cup wins. Still, with an average squad age of 23 years old, the prospects remain bright for the club. However, those players will have to prove that a team is only as good as its manager. With the season culminating this weekend, shares in the company could witness rising volatility at least until a new successor is signed and even then the Premier League is closed for the summer. The chart below shows Man U's share performance since the club's stock began trading in August. ThinkorswimClick to enlarge

Paul Singer, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Elliot Management, believes there are still deadly, fundamental flaws in the global economy. Another Lehman moment, he writes in his latest letter to investors, could come upon us easily, as financial institutions are still holding massive books of derivatives, private equity, and other illiquid investments. Yes, Singer admits, banks are probably trying to decrease their positions in these assets, but we can't tell by how much based on the numbers they're reporting. One can only assess that the industry is still risky, opaque, and overleveraged. But, Singer still has faith that these problems can be fixed — that, if the governments around the globe collaborate to take certain measures, the system can be simplified. In his letter he lays out nine points for how that aim can be achieved. What Singer is proposing is an end to a global Too Big To Fail.  But it's not that he wants banks to be out on their own; quite the contrary. He sees that banks are a utility that may, from time to time, need government assistance. That's fine, he says, as long as they're making mark-to-market payments. If they're not, the banks will trigger a "termination event." Yikes! Here in the U.S., Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and David Vitter (R-LA) have proposed legislation to end Too Big Too Fail, but it's not nearly this comprehensive — where their bill is black and white (fail or no fail) Singer understands that there is a significant gray area. The only point where the Brown/Vitter bill directly agrees with Singer is on risk-weighted assets. Otherwise, Singer is on  a different plane, and it's something to consider.

REUTERS/Larry DowningFed Chairman Ben BernankeIn February, Bloomberg reported that members of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) – made up of high-level executives at Wall Street's biggest investment banks and asset managers – warned in a quarterly TBAC meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that farmland, junk bonds, and mortgage real estate investment trusts were looking bubbly. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, Bloomberg obtained the minutes to that meeting and has revealed some more information about what was said at the meeting in a new report. According to the minutes, Bloomberg reporters Craig Torres and Joshua Zumbrun write that the TBAC opposed the Fed's third round of quantitative easing – this time open-ended, unlike the previous two iterations – when it was announced in September: The advisory council opposed continued Fed accommodation on Sept. 14, a day after the conclusion of the FOMC’s two-day meeting Sept. 12-13. The Fed after that gathering announced a third round of bond buying with purchases of $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities. “Further accommodation is not warranted,” the bankers said, according to the minutes. The advisory council warned of distorted bond prices resulting from the Fed’s purchases, limited impact on the economy, and “uncertain effects” from an eventual unwinding of the balance sheet, including “risks to price and financial stability.” However, by the time of the meeting in February, the banks were on board with the program. Torres and Zumbrun say the minutes "trace how the 12 bankers’ views evolved from opposition to the Fed’s announcement of new bond buying in September to support for Fed efforts in February to boost an economic expansion beset by a 'drag' from fiscal tightening."

The better-than-expected Chinese trade data has everyone crying foul. Nomura's Zhiwei Zhang, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Weijun Hu and Ting Lu, and Societe Generale's Wei Yao have all pointed to discrepancies between China's numbers and the numbers of its trading partners. Furthermore, all point to companies using inflated bills as a way to circumvent strict Chinese capital controls and move money in and out of the mainland. "In 1Q13, China’s export data were heavily distorted due to over-reporting by exporters who might bring in hot money through fake exports and arbitrage the differential between CNH/USD and CNY/USD by moving goods in and out of HK," said BAML's Hu and Lu. SocGen's Yao is actually having a hard time finding people who aren't engaged in this practice. "As for reasons, our observation from the trips to the mainland led us to believe that there is indeed a large amount of speculative capital flows," wrote Yao in a note to clients. "Nearly all corporates we met admitted that they were conducting some forms of interest rate arbitrage on the expectation of further yuan appreciation."
Global comparable store sales fell 0.6%, which was worse than the 0.48% decline expected. "As we begin the second quarter against the backdrop of a persistently challenging macro environment, the McDonald's System is aligned around executing our long-term strategies to drive sustained, profitable growth," said CEO Don Thompson. Here's the regional breakdown: "In April, APMEA's comparable sales declined 2.9%, reflecting the impact of Avian influenza, primarily in China, and softer results in Japan and Australia," wrote the company.
APUS President Barack Obama said Tuesday he had both a moral and a national security obligation to stop the slaughter in Syria, but warned he could not just act on a "hope and a prayer." Obama defended his government's actions in sending large quantities of humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees, providing non-lethal help to rebels and isolating President Bashar al-Assad in the international community. "I think that understandably, there's a desire for easy answers," Obama said, referring to domestic critics who are demanding a more proactive US role, including an operation to arm rebel groups and a no-fly zone. "My job is to constantly measure our very real and legitimate humanitarian and national security interests in Syria, but measuring those against my bottom line, which is, what's in the best interests of America's security." Obama said that he could not make decisions "based on a hope and a prayer, but on hard-headed analysis in terms of what will actually make us safer and stabilize the region." "I think that we have both a moral obligation and a national security interest in, A, ending the slaughter in Syria but, B, also ensuring that we've got a stable Syria that is representative of all the Syrian people and is not creating chaos for its neighbors," he said. The president spoke as political critics complain that he has not acted more quickly on reports that Syrian forces had used chemical weapons, an action he had previously said would infringe a red line and be a game-changer. He said that before acting, Washington must first establish exactly who had used chemical weapons and when, in an apparent reference to the flawed intelligence that led America into war with Iraq. "I don't make decisions based on perceived," he said, when asked by a reporter about perceived violations of US red lines. "I can't organize international coalitions around perceived. We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well." "There have been several instances during the course of my presidency where I said I was going to do something, and it ended up getting done. "In the end, whether it's bin Laden or Kadhafi, if we say we're taking a position, I would think at this point, the international community has a pretty good sense that we typically follow through on our commitments."

AFPNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a rising star in the Republican party touted as a possible presidential contender in 2016, confirmed Tuesday he had undergone weight loss surgery. The politician -- who has received negative press over his weight -- said he had had a gastric band implanted three months ago, though he insisted the decision had nothing to do with his political ambitions. "It's not a career issue for me, it is a long-term health issue," Christie told reporters at a press conference. He said, after making many attempts to shed pounds over the years, the surgery was "an opportunity to try something different." A gastric band, placed around the stomach, limits the quantity of food that a person can eat. The governor said he hadn't discussed the procedure for three months after his February 16 operation because it was "nobody else's business." The former prosecutor rose to national prominence during Hurricane Sandy last year, which struck New Jersey hard. His weight and possible related health issues, however, would likely be an immediate issue if he made a run for the White House, and have already become targets in US news. Last December, the 50-year-old became exasperated, saying it was "ridiculous" to think his weight would make him a poor president. "That's ridiculous. I mean, that's ridiculous. People watched me for the last number of weeks in Hurricane Sandy doing 18-hour days, so I don't really think that would be a problem," he said during an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters. He said he had tried to slim down. "If I could figure that out, I would fix it," he said. "I've had more diets and lost and gained back more weight in my life than I could count." Christie, elected to his first term as governor in 2009, declined to attempt a presidential bid in October 2011. But he was one of the top speakers at the Republican convention last year, and he is already perceived as a strong contender for Republicans in 2016, especially after his popularity soared from his handling of Hurricane Sandy.

Earlier today, China published its official April trade figures. And while the numbers for both imports and exports were much stronger than expected, experts have been left scratching their heads over the unusual discrepancies. For one thing, exports surged 14.7% year-over-year even as exports to the U.S. fell by 0.7%. Exports to the EU fell by 6.4%. In a note to clients, Nomura's Zhiwei Zhang attributed it to companies trying to get around strict Chinese capital controls. "We believe exports to destinations like Hong Kong, a major financial hub, are likely being over-invoiced in an attempt to circumvent capital controls and bring foreign capital into China," said Zhang who pointed out that exports to Hong Kong surged by 57.2%. Societe Generale's Wei Yao agrees with Zhang.   "As for reasons, our observation from the trips to the mainland led us to believe that there is indeed a large amount of speculative capital flows," wrote Yao in a note to clients. "Nearly all corporates we met admitted that they were conducting some forms of interest rate arbitrage on the expectation of further yuan appreciation." But Hong Kong wasn't the only discrepancy. Yao noted a whopper in the Taiwan numbers. "Head-scratching discrepancies in bilateral data comparison persisted on both sides of the ledger," she wrote. "Compared with the data from Taiwan – the only economy besides China that has published the complete set of April data – growth of mainland exports to Taiwan was 57.7 ppt faster based on China’s data (+49.2% yoy vs. -2.7% yoy) and that of mainland’s imports from Taiwan was 58.6ppt faster (+55.7% yoy vs. -2.9% yoy)! The gaps narrowed only marginally from March." No wonder people question the reliability of the data. Societe Generale
Stephen Lovekin/Getty ImagesGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
AFPJuerg BuerginA Swiss ex-banker was sentenced Wednesday to more than four months in jail for having sex with an under-aged Singaporean prostitute, in a sleaze scandal that sparked uproar in the city-state. Singapore Judge Eddy Tham denounced Juerg Buergin's "reckless" act of having intercourse with the 17-year-old woman on two occasions at five star hotels in 2010 and 2011. Wearing a light blue shirt, Buergin â€” who booked the prostitute through an escort agency website â€” looked sombre throughout the court proceedings and looked down several times as the judge read out the verdict. "In terms of culpability, the accused clearly did not take any reasonable steps to avoid falling foul of the law. He was reckless in not verifying the age of the minor," the verdict said. "He is not a naive person but someone holding a responsible position as a banker. He conceded that not everything he read (on) the Internet should be accepted at face value," it added. Buergin, a married 41-year-old former executive with banking giant UBS, had said at the start of his trial in March that he was tricked into thinking the girl was older than 17. Prostitution is legal in Singapore but it is against the law to pay for the sexual services of girls under 18, in a bid to protect the young from exploitation. The case caused an uproar last year in Singapore after Buergin and 50 other men, including business executives, a former school principal, a navy captain and a police superintendent, were accused of paying for sex with the girl. One of them was socialite and environmental activist Howard Shaw, 41, a grandson of Asian movie mogul Runme Shaw. He was sentenced to 12 weeks in jail but released after eight weeks for good behaviour. Court documents showed that Buergin booked the prostitute, who went by the name "Chantelle," on an escort agency's website. Buergin made the bookings under a false name "Robert James" but the mobile number he used was traced to UBS, which had assigned the phone to him. The judge said he had originally decided on a five-month jail term, but sentenced Buergin to four months and three weeks in jail taking into consideration the six days he spent in remand. Defence lawyer Selva Naidu said Buergin "doesn't intend to appeal for now" but has two weeks to decide. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
ABC NewsPolice have detained 31 people in three countries in connection with a spectacular diamond heist at the Brussels Airport, according to a Belgian prosecutor and reported by The Associated Press. On February 18 armed men dressed like police stole more than $50 million worth of diamonds after they cut an hole in the airport fence, approached the plane in black cars with blue police lights flashing, unloaded the diamonds at gunpoint, and sped away. "This was a very precise, almost military-organized and well-executed robbery," Brussels Airport Spokesman Van der Cruysse said after the raid. He added that the thieves needed only three minutes at the plane and only 11 minutes total to seize 120 parcels containing diamonds as well as some precious metals.  At the time the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Belgium broadcaster VRT reported the loot may have been worth as much as $350 million. On Wednesday Bijnens said police detained a FrenchmanÂ believed to be one of the robbersÂ in France, six people in Switzerland, and 24 in Belgium. An unspecified amount of money and diamonds connected with the heist â€” the money in Belgium and the diamonds in Switzerland â€” have been recovered.
Private investors plowed in billions too. It ended up in a massive pileup of capital destruction. Fatalities were everywhere. One was Solyndra that â€“ after devouring close to $1 billion, including $385 million from the Federal Government and $25 million from nearly bankrupt California â€“ declared bankruptcy in 2011. There were scores of other boondoggles. Some were startups. Others were projects run by mega-corporations like GE and Siemens. But the euphoria has since hissed out of the construct. Private investors and taxpayers alike grabbed what they could and fled. And not just in the US. The PEW Charitable Trust reported that in 2012, G-20 green-tech asset financing dropped 20% from 2011. Within that, venture-capital and private-equity funding plunged 34%. And public-market funding plummeted 55%. I know several people with PhDs in arcane fields whose jobs evaporated in 2012 when their startups were shuttered or became mere skeletons. That industry was so ravaged that they had to move on to other industries. Sure, the industry lives, but without the hype. Investors have jumped on to the next big thing: rather than profit from preventing climate change, they'd profit from climate change per se â€“ or rather, the fear of climate change. There are a few problemitas. One is the nature of climate change. It moves at snailâ€™s pace for investors who have a quarter-to-quarter attention span. Many generations of tidal gauges in the San Francisco Bay, first installed in 1854, have recorded an 8-inch rise in the coastal sea level over the last century. Now the extrapolation starts. By 2050, as global warming melts glaciers and polar icecaps, coastal sea levels might rise 18 inches, some experts predict. It would threaten airports, neighborhoods, commercial districts, and farmland situated on reclaimed land. The Bay Area would have to deal with it: fight or flight. Climate adaptation. It would be costly. Some intrepid experts predict that the Planet would warm 3Â° to 8Â° Fahrenheit by 2100, by which time the sea level in the Bay might have risen six feet. Whatever the outcome, for investors, itâ€™s a tough sell. They want to profit now, not after theyâ€™re dead. The emphasis has to be on milestones, next year, ongoing profits, or an exit down the line; and on big issues happening now, like Superstorm Sandy. Climate change is mentioned in the same breath â€“ thus immediacy. Let the money flow! And itâ€™s flowing, according to Bloomberg. â€œClimate risk is something people are paying more and more attention to,â€ said Barney Schauble, managing partner at Nephila Advisors, the US branch of an $8 billion Bermuda hedge fund that gambles in weather derivatives. In January, private equity goliath KKR acquired a 25% stake in it. â€œMore volatile weather creates more risk and more appetite to protect against that risk,â€ Schauble said. â€œClimate change for us is a driver,â€ said Marc Robert, Chief Operating Officer of hedge fund Water Asset Management in New York. It acquires water rights and invests in water treatment companies. For them, drought is a godsend. â€œNot enough people are thinking long term of [water] as an asset that is worthy of ownership,â€ he said. â€œThe cities that are close to the waterline continue to grow and have more money and need for protection; itâ€™s almost a natural growth market,â€ said Piet Dircke of Arcadis, a Dutch company with $3.3 billion in revenues. The company calls him a â€œglobal expert in flood protection and climate adaptation for coastal and delta citiesâ€; heâ€™s now leading Arcadis' post-Sandy damage assessments and recovery plans. He said his phone was ringing nonstop after Sandy. â€œThe climate is changing. Sea level is rising. Thatâ€™s quite obvious,â€ he said. San Francisco, dreading any further rise in sea level, is also on the companyâ€™s client list, as are other US cities. Entire industries have mushroomed around this concept of climate adaptation. A Google search for "adaptation conference" brings up thousands of relevant results. Like â€œgreen tech conferenceâ€ used to. The UN believes that the infrastructure and technology needed to deal with the consequences of climate change will cost $130 billion a year by 2030. Accurate or not, itâ€™s too far out for investors. For now, itâ€™s the fear of climate change that is the next big thing, and theyâ€™re all scrambling to get their slice of that pie. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are stumbling like drunken but determined sailors from one all-time high to the next, despite lousy employment and economic data, andÂ declining corporate revenues. Bonds have done the same. And their 100-year graph has assumed the terrifying shape of open crocodile jaws, worse even than in 1999 and 2007. Read.... â€œThe Mother Of AllÂ Shortsâ€

Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesLast night, China reported stronger than expected imports and exports. Nomura calls it bunk, saying that the numbers are being distorted by an attempt by Chinese companies to circumvent capital controls. In other words, traders are finding a way to get more money into China (which is regulated to avoid an influx of cash) by overpaying for goods shipped from China to Hong Kong. Says Nomura's Zhiwei Zhang: China's export growth rose to 14.7% y-o-y in April from 10.0% in March, which was much stronger than expected (Consensus: 9.2%; Nomura: 8.0%; Figure 1). By destination, export growth to all major economies remained negative, albeit somewhat improved: exports to the US eased to -0.7% y-o-y in April from -6.5%, while those to the EU eased to -6.4% from -14.0% and those to Japan eased to -1.2% from -10.0% (Figure 2). However, growth of exports to Hong Kong was strong at 57.2% y-o-y in April from 92.9% in March, and those to Asean grew by 37.2% from 11.6% in March. Data suggest that demand in emerging markets has been holding up well, despite the ongoing weak demand in the advanced economies. We believe exports to destinations like Hong Kong, a major financial hub, are likely being over-invoiced in an attempt to circumvent capital controls and bring foreign capital into China. This view is supported by the recent SAFE announcement of capital flow controls on 5 May, which identified trade as a potential channel for unregulated capital flows. Furthermore: We believe the strong trade growth is not indicative of a growth recovery. Instead, it may have reflected continued capital inflows in April. On 5 May, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced a set of measures to crack down on the practice of misreporting in the trade sector, which reinforces our view that the trade growth has been artificially high in 2013 because firms over-reported the value of their exports. Also, exports and imports from the tax-free special custom zones soared in recent months, reaching 9.5% of total exports and 14.4% of total imports for the first 4 months in 2013, compared to 3.1% and 8.6% in the same period of 2012 (Figure 4). This further supports our contention that trade growth has been artificially high. We believe some of these trade flows may have been utilized for capital flows purposes. Excluding trade from these zones, we estimate that Chinaâ€Ÿs export growth was 6.6% y-o-y in April, while import growth was 9.3% (Figures 5 and 6). The distortion of working days also exaggerated export and import growth numbers. This year, April had two more working days than it did last year, which we estimate may have contributed 5 percentage points to trade growth.
Jim D. Woodward / FlickrBERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is looking into buying bad loans from southern Europe to relieve the pressure on banks in crisis-stricken countries, the German newspaper Die Welt reported. The ECB wants to revive asset-backed securities (ABS) which allow banks to pass at least some of the credit risk on to other investors as they try to boost their capital and liquidity buffers to adapt to new regulatory standards - one reason for their reluctance to lend. In an advance copy of a report due to be published on Wednesday, Die Welt said the ECB not only wanted to improve the framework for asset-backed securities but, citing central bank sources, said the ECB's Governing Council was also discussing whether the central bank could itself buy these securities. The newspaper cited the sources as saying it was quite possible that a majority of those sitting on the ECB council would be in favour of such action, though there were also stern opponents including the Bundesbank and several members of the ECB's executive board. Die Welt said an ECB spokesman did not want to comment and pointed to ECB President Mario Draghi's public statements, according to which the discussions are by no means over yet. Last week Draghi said: "The Governing Council decided to start consultations with other European institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities," adding that no decisions had been taken. The ECB was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. (Reporting by Michelle Martin; editing by Christopher Wilson) Copyright (2013) Thomson Reuters. Click for restrictions

Analysts' latest adjustments to corporate earnings forecasts for Japanese firms show many more upward than downward revisions. Merrill Lynch tracks the "number of stocks for which consensus EPS estimate has risen vs. the number for which it has fallen" over a 3-month period. That ratio (chart below) has spiked relative to other nations. Merrill sites the new government's initiatives of fiscal spending, wage growth, and deregulation to stimulate growth as the reason for this optimism. Of course the BOJ's monetary expansion (see post) doesn't hurt either. In spite ofÂ projected debt to GDP ratio of 230% by 2014 - the highest in the developed world - Japan doesn't view its government debt to be a serious enough issue. So why not spend some more in order to improve corporate earnings while attempting to exit years of deflation? BofA/ML
Andrea SartoratiLegendary coach of UK football club Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, has retired. There were rumors of this in recent days, and now it's official. (Here are the odds on who will replace him.) Ferguson stood alone as the greatest coach in the league. Twitter is absolutely exploding with the hashtag #ThankYouSirAlex. From the ManU site: ----------------------------- Â Sir Alex retiresÂ  â€¢ Thirteenth league title in 26 years will be his last â€¢ Most successful manager in English football history to become a director of Manchester United FCÂ  NYSE: MANU.Â  Manchester, UK. Sir Alex Ferguson will retire at the end of the season, Manchester United announced today.Â  The most successful manager in English football history will bow out after the West Bromwich Albion game on 19 May and join the football club board.Â  Announcing his decision to retire, Sir Alex Ferguson said:Â  â€œThe decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. It is the right time.Â  â€œIt was important to me to leave an organisation in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so. The quality of this league winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level whilst the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one.Â  â€œOur training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home Old Trafford is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world.Â  â€œGoing forward, I am delighted to take on the roles of both Director and Ambassador for the club. With these activities, along with my many other interests, I am looking forward to the future.Â  â€œI must pay tribute to my family, their love and support has been essential. My wife Cathy has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to me. â€œAs for my players and staff, past and present, I would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without their contribution the history of this great club would not be as rich. â€œIn my early years, the backing of the board, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team. â€œOver the past decade, the Glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy Chief Executive in David Gill. I am truly grateful to all of them. â€œTo the fans, thank you. The support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling. It has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United.â€ Joel Glazer said: â€œAlex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but heâ€™s also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the Club have been truly remarkable.Â I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow." Avie Glazer said: â€œI am delighted to announce that Alex has agreed to stay with the Club as a director.Â His contributions to Manchester United over the last 26 years have been extraordinary and, like all United fans, I want him to be a part of its future.â€ David Gill said: â€œIâ€™ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with Alex for 16 unforgettable years â€“ through the Treble, the double, countless trophy wins and numerous signings. â€œWe knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first class condition. â€œAlexâ€™s vision, energy and ability have built teams â€“ both on and off the pitch â€“ that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport. â€œThe way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that I admire. It is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that I have been privileged to witness in the last 16 years. â€œWhat he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.â€ Follow the latest news and reaction via www.ManUtd.com/thankyousiralex and #thankyousiralex
Most active managers prove their worth when the market declines. Â But what about the other, oh, 75% of the time when the market is rising? Â The reality is that being an active manager is incredibly difficult in an environment where the market seems to never go down. Â If youâ€™re not leveraged, strategically differentiated, lucky or unusually skilled the odds are heavily against an active manager outperforming a market like the one weâ€™ve seen in 2013 where stocks just donâ€™t go down. Â But should the discrepancy look THIS bad? Here are the YTD returns from the basic approaches: Bear in mind youâ€™re probably paying 2 &amp; 20 for that 3.77%. Â Thatâ€™s not bad. Â Thatâ€™s awful. When I do portfolio reviews with people I always tell them that Wall Street wants to sell them the Ferrari because it sounds fancy, looks slick, drives fast and, oh yeah, itâ€™s expensive. Â But that ignores the reality of life. Â We donâ€™t need to get from point A to point B driving 100 mph in a flashy car. Â Weâ€™ve got our kids in the back, bumps along the way and in most instances that means a more prudent approach to preparing our savings portfolio (yes, youâ€™re probably not an investor!). Â Most of us think we want a Ferrari, but for 90% of us a Honda Accord is safer, almost as fast and a heckuvalot less expensive. Â And if the recent performance of the HFRX is any tell, that Ferrari you own is probably built with a Go Kart engineâ€¦.
Flickr via nanoprobe67The trend this week continues: It's very quiet. Asian markets were fairly quiet, although Japan did gain 0.7% to hit a new record for its run. After solid trade data from China, the Shanghai composite gained 0.48%. Europe is totally flat, and US futures are a hair in the red. Too minuscule at this point to matter. Still, as quiet as things are, the story is that the bull market remains on and nobody seems to be concerned with much of everything. There's virtually no data to speak of this week.
