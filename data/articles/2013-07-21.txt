REUTERS/Larry DowningPresident Barack Obama will kick off a fresh round of speeches on the economy this week, the White House said, in which he will seek to pivot back to the subject before a slew of budget fights later this year.Â  The first of the series of speeches is set to come Wednesday at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., where Obama delivered an economic speech shortly after he was elected a U.S. senator in 2005. He'll then travel to theÂ University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Mo., to deliver remarks later that day. In a blog post that was emailed out to those subscribed to the White House listserv, White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer billed it as a speech "you're going to want to watch." "The President thinks Washington has largely taken its eye off the ball on the most important issue facing the country," Pfeiffer said.  "Instead of talking about how to help the middle class, too many in Congress are trying to score political points, refight old battles, and trump up phony scandals. And in a couple of months, we will face some more critical budget deadlines that require Congressional action, not showdowns that only serve to harm families and businesses â€” and the President wants to talk about the issues that should be at the core of that debate." The White House hinted that a major theme of the speeches will be the economic benefits of immigration reform, which faces a tough path in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. But Obama is also set to use the bully pulpit to set up what are expected to be a number of fights in the fall over the budget, including the start of a new fiscal year in October and a deadline to raise the debt ceiling in November or December.
Following the Japanese upper-house election over the weekend, the dollar has once again fallen below 100 against the yen. From FinViz: FinViz As expected, the party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (the LDP) won big in upper-house elections. But there's a little bit of talk that maybe they could have done slightly better (they didn't win an outright majority, and will have to be part of a coalition). Or perhaps the big victory was totally priced in. Nonetheless, there's a slight bout of risk aversion to start the week, and so the yen is strengthening, countering the general trend since Abenomics began, which has seen the yen weaken considerably.
The Federal Reserve has said it won't begin to taper its stimulative bond buying program and raise interest rates until the outlook for the labor market has significantly improved. But how will we know when we get to that point? A new paper from the Kansas City Fed, "Assessing Labor Market Conditions: The level of activity and the speed of improvement," tries to answer that, and it argues the U.S. labor market won't return to normal for at least another two years(via Reuters' Paige Gance). Authors Craig Hakkio and Jonathan Willis took 23 labor market variables and distilled them into two indicators. The first, "level of activity," includes the traditional unemployment rate, and measures related to marginally attached workers and the long-term unemployed. while "rate of change" takes into account growth rates of private employment, total hours worked, and average hourly earnings, among others.  Kansas City Federal ReserveHere's what they found: Since September 2012, [level of activity] has been increasing at a faster average monthly rate of 0.042. Despite these steady gains, the level is still about one standard deviation below its historical average. Over the prior two decades, the level was higher than it is now 79 percent of the time. In contrast to the level of activity, the measure capturing the rate of change in labor market conditions has been well above average for some time. This measure has had an average value of 0.77 since September 2012. Prior to September 2012, the speed of improvement in the labor market exceeded this level only 14 percent of the time. They conclude that given where current activity levels are now, and how fast they're improving, the labor market won't return to its mean level of activity until summer 2015. This lends credence to Ben Bernanke's belief that the regular unemployment rate understates the weakness of the labor market.
Maureen lunn/Flickr,CCWith interest rates rising, mortgage refinancings going down, and a few weak datapoints in other areas lately, there's been talk about the housing recovery stalling. The housing recovery is a huge part of the overall economic story, so if it fades, it presents a serious risk. In light of that, it's important to remember what's actually meant by the housing recovery. Bill McBride at Calculated Risk offers a good reminder: The problem is many people don't understand what "housing recovery" means.  There are really two recoveries: House prices and residential investment. Most people - homeowners and potential buyers - focus on prices, and for prices we should use the repeat sales indexes, and not the NAR median price (repeat sales indexes include Case-Shiller, CoreLogic, etc). What matters in the NAR report for prices is inventory and months-of-supply.  For GDP and jobs, the key is what the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) calls "residential investment" (RI) . For existing homes, only the broker's commission is part of GDP, but for new homes the entire sales price is part of GDP. There are some spillover effects from home sales (furniture, etc), but those aren't included in RI.  If existing home sales decline there is only a minor impact on RI and GDP. When we talk about the "housing recovery" for jobs and GDP, existing home sales are mostly irrelevant - the focus should be on new home sales, housing starts and home improvement.  This is a reminder that the key number in the existing home sales report is not sales, but inventory. It is mostly visible inventory that impacts prices. When we look at sales for existing homes, the focus should be on the composition between conventional and distressed, not total sales.  Bottom line: I expect sales to be below the consensus, but for conventional sales to be increasing.  I also expect further evidence that inventory bottomed early this year.  And, oh, expect some more uninformed hand wringing! Prices and inventory. Keep your eye on those things, and don't take your eye off the ball.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstReal estate investors are getting back in the flipping game, netting an average gross profit of nearly $20,000 on single family home flips in the first half of 2013. Home flips are up 19% from a year ago and 74% from the first half of 2011, according to a new report from Realtytrac. "While flipping continues to be profitable in most markets, particularly those where the home price recovery is still nascent and a recent rebound in foreclosure activity allows investors to find distressed inventory at a discount, home flipping is tapering off in markets where fewer of those distressed bargains are available," Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, said in the statement. "Flipping was on the rise in more than two-thirds of the markets, including New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and several Florida metros," he said. The average flipper in the following 15 metro areas earned 10% to 82% flipping their homes.
 The "prisoner's dilemma" is a familiar concept to just about everyone who took Econ 101. The basic version goes like this: Two criminals are arrested, but police can't convict either on the primary charge, so they plan to sentence them to a year in jail on a lesser charge. Each of the prisoners, who can't communicate with each other, are given the option of testifying against their partner. If they testify, and their partner remains silent, the partner gets three years and they go free. If they both testify, both get two. If both remain silent, they each get one. In game theory, betraying your partner, or "defecting" is always the dominant strategy as it always has a slightly higher payoff in a simultaneous game. It's what's known as a "Nash Equilibrium," after Nobel Prize winning mathematician and "A Beautiful Mind" subject John Nash. In sequential games, where players know each other's previous behavior and have the opportunity to punish each other, defection is the dominant strategy as well.  However, on an overall basis, the best outcome for both players is mutual cooperation. Yet no one's ever actually run the experiment on real prisoners before, until two University of Hamburg economists tried it out in a recent study comparing the behavior of inmates and students.  Surprisingly, for the classic version of the game, prisoners were far more cooperative than expected. Menusch Khadjavi and Andreas Lange put the famous game to the test for the first time ever, putting a group of prisoners in Lower Saxony's primary women's prison, as well as students, through both simultaneous and sequential versions of the game.  The payoffs obviously weren't years off sentences, but euros for students, and the equivalent value in coffee or cigarettes for prisoners.  They expected, building off of game theory and behavioral economic research that show humans are more cooperative than the purely rational model that economists traditionally use, that there would be a fair amount of first-mover cooperation, even in the simultaneous simulation where there's no way to react to the other player's decisions.  And even in the sequential game, where you get a higher payoff for betraying a cooperative first mover, a fair amount will still reciprocate.  As for the difference between student and prisoner behavior, you'd expect that a prison population might be more jaded and distrustful, and therefore more likely to defect.  The results went exactly the other way for the simultaneous game, only 37% of students cooperated. Inmates cooperated 56% of the time. On a pair basis, only 13% of student pairs managed to get the best mutual outcome and cooperate, whereas 30% of prisoners do.  In the sequential game, far more students (63%) cooperate, so the mutual cooperation rate skyrockets to 39%. For prisoners, it remains about the same. What's interesting is that the simultaneous game requires far more blind trust from both parties, and you don't have a chance to retaliate or make up for being betrayed later. Yet prisoners are still significantly more cooperative in that scenario.  Obviously the payoffs aren't as serious as a year or three of your life, but the paper still demonstrates that prisoners aren't necessarily as calculating, self-interested, and un-trusting as you might expect, and as behavioral economists have argued for years, as mathematically interesting as Nash equilibrium might be, they don't line up with real behavior all that well.  
Flickr/ Avi and Elina FlaxThis post originally appeared at Real Men Real Style. Black shoes and a black suit work great if you’re going to a funeral, but most of the time we’re a little more colorful in our wardrobes. How does a man wearing a navy, light-grey, or brown suit match his shoes with the suit color?  Take a moment to get to know the chart below. It pairs the five most common suit colors — navy, medium or mid-gray, charcoal, brown, and black — with three different shoes to show you which colors work with which leathers. Now, are these shoe matching rules absolute? Not entirely — but it’s a very safe guide to follow. If you’re bucking the advice here, it should be because you’re going for a really unique look or you know the rules and make a conscious decision to ignore them! For example, we don’t have the burgundy shoes paired with a black suit. But a rocker might wear a black suit with red Converse All-Stars, and that would be, if not exactly timeless men’s style, certainly a style choice that could work. Reprinted from Real Men Real Style There are going to be exceptions. But there aren’t many of them, and if you’re sticking to classic business and business-casual dress, let this chart be your guide. Most of the time it’s not too hard. Strict business formality is easy — a charcoal gray or navy blue suit and plain black shoes. But as the suits (and the business climate) become more relaxed, you get the option of wearing different colors of leather with them. That’s a stumbling block for a lot of men — and the wrong color of shoes and belt can ruin even a fine suit. Here’s how most of these combinations play out in practical, day-to-day dress: 1. Navy Blue Suits Pair with: Navy can go comfortably with all three of the main color families of men’s leather shoes. You can probably even make a navy suit work with more exotic colors if you have them, although blue is generally too close to make a good contrast. The leather color mostly affects the formality and attitude of a navy suit. Black shoes are business dress, while brown are more relaxed, and red or burgundy give it the most playful, social feel. 2. Medium and Light Grey Suits Pair with: Medium gray suits are less formal than navy suits, and share a similar flexibility. You can pair them effectively with just about any color of leather. In the case of medium gray, black is the best option when you’re wearing a white shirt and a necktie. It’s still not proper business dress (the suit itself is too light), but it’s quite typical in offices where suits are mandatory but somewhat relaxed. Brown and burgundy shoes make it more of a casual/social look, and work best when the shirt has a bit of pattern or color to it as well. 3. Brown Suits Pair with: Do not pair with: Take a caveat here — brown suits work with most brown shoes. You want a visible contrast between the color of the shoe leather and the color of the suit. If they’re identical or almost-identical, it looks off. Apart from that, brown’s great with most casual leather shoes. It’s generally better to have the shoe leather darker than the suit (helps keep the eye from being drawn downward), but either way can work so long as you have a clear contrast. 4. Charcoal Grey Suits Pair with: Do not pair with: Here’s where we get to our first firm “no” on the list: don’t pair charcoal suits with brown shoes. Dark browns look like you’re trying for a close match and coming up short. Light browns are too informal, and draw the eye jarringly downward. Plain black works best, or a deep burgundy for a look that’s relaxed but still elegant. 5. Black Suits Pair with: Do not pair with: Black’s not very flexible. That’s why we generally recommend charcoal gray or navy blue in its place as a first suit. If you own one, pair it with black shoes, and save the outfit for funerals and strict business dress occasions. Any other color of shoe is going to look too casual with black. 6. Other Colors The chart at the top is built around the most common colors of suit and leather dress shoes. You’ll probably end up with more colors of suit/trouser than just those five, and more colors of shoe than those three. That especially gets true once you start wearing leather shoes with casual trousers (like jeans), or dress suits with casual shoes (like canvas sneakers). Experiment and find out what works for you. The more casual the outfit, the less strict the rules, so if you’re doing something deliberately convention-defying (like the rocker example we used at the start), don’t sweat it too much. If it looks good in the mirror, go with it, and don’t worry whether it’s “right” or not. As with all colors, the most important thing to remember is to avoid things that are close but not quite matching. Those are the worst-looking clashes — it looks like you tried for a unified outfit and screwed it up a little. Keep the contrast clear and you should be fine.
Monthly data reported in the last week included big drops in housing permits and starts. Because permits are an element of the LEI, that came in flat. Retail sales grew 0.4%, but consumer inflation was up 0.5% due mainly to gas prices, so real retail sales declined slightly. Industrial production was up, as were both the Philly Fed and the Empire State manufacturing indexes.  Let's start this week's look at the high frequency weekly indicators by looking at the Oil choke collar: Oil prices and usage The price of Oil increased further again this week to a new 52 week high. I am still unable to find any rational reason for this. The price of a gallon of gas rose sharply as a result. The 4 week average for gas usage was, for the second time in a long time, up YoY. Interest rates and credit spreads Interest rates for corporate bonds had generally been falling since being just above 6% in January 2011, hitting a low of 4.46% in November 2012. Treasuries previously were at a 2.4% high in late 2011, falling to a low of 1.47% in July 2012, but have spiked back above that high. Spreads have varied between a high over 3.4% in June 2011 to a low under 2.75% in October 2012, and are very close to that low again. Housing metrics  Mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association: Refinancing applications have decreased sharply in the last 8 weeks due to higher interest rates to a two year low. Purchase applications have also declined from their multiyear highs in April, and this week were again only slightly positive YoY. Housing prices Housing prices bottomed at the end of November 2011 on Housing Tracker, and averaged an increase of +2.0% to +2.5% YoY during 2012. This weeks's YoY increase remained close to its 6 year record.  Real estate loans, from the FRB H8 report: Loans turned up at the end of 2011 and averaged about 1% gains YoY through most of 2012. Â In the last several months the comparisons have completely stalled. Money supply M1 M2 Real M1 made a YoY high of about 20% in January 2012 and eased off thereafter. Earlier this year it increased again but has backed off its highs significantly. Â Real M2 also made a YoY high of about 10.5% in January 2012. Â Its subsequent low was 4.5% in August 2012. It increased slightly in the first few months of this year and has generally stabilized since. Employment metrics American Staffing AssociationIndex Initial jobless claims Tax Withholding The ASA deteriorated to being flat or negative compared with last year in the last several months. This week's decline was seasonal in nature due to July 4. Daily tax withholding remained in the lower part of its YoY range compared with its YoY average comparison in the last 6 months. Initial claims remain within their recent range of between 325,000 to 375,000, and have flattened out just as they have in the last 3 springs and summers. Transport Railroad transport from the AAR Shipping transport Rail transport has been both positive and negative YoY in the last several months. This week it was negative once again.Â The Harpex index had been improving slowly from its January 1 low of 352, but has flattened out in the last 5 weeks. The Baltic Dry Index remained close to its 52 week high. Consumer spending Gallup's YoY comparisons are still very positive. The ICSC varied between +1.5% and +4.5% YoY in 2012, while Johnson Redbook was generally below +3%. The ICSC has recently been relatively weak, but Johnson Redbook remains close to the high end of its range. Bank lending rates The TED spread is still near the low end of its 3 year range. Â LIBOR rose remains slightly above the new 3 year low it established four weeks ago. JoC ECRI Commodity prices The sharp rise in interest rates and the sharp decrease in mortgage refinancing have now been joined by a big spike in Oil prices, which is now being felt at the pump. The decline in housing permits and starts show that it is already being impacted. Purchase mortgages have also backed off their earlier improvement. Temporary jobs are also negative YoY again, as are railroad shipments.  Positives include consumer spending, jobless claims, house prices, and bank and money rates. Spreads between corporate bonds and treasuries are also near their lows.  Once again the story remains that coincident indicators are holding up, while the long leading indicators of interest rates, housing, and corporate earnings have turned negative. The only long leading indicator still positive is Real M2. The Oil price spike and continuing sequestration certainly aren't helping.  Have a nice weekend.
Brazil has something of an identity crisis right now. As protests continue, the world has been exposed to the massive social unrest in the country over inequality, corruption, and the adverse economics of preparing to host global sporting events like the upcoming World Cup. Still, as one of the so-called BRIC countries â€”Â a term that has become less vogue as investors take a wider look at emerging market countriesÂ â€”Â Brazil is uniquely positioned to keep growing. In his book â€” "Brazil Is The New America" â€” investment writer James Dale Davidson argues that Brazil is indeed the new America. That is, Brazil will flourish and the U.S. will collapse. And it'll happen this century. Now, it's important to note that many of his views would be considered extreme.Â  And for what it's worth, Donald Trump was quoted saying, "This is a book about your future." Davidson spends a chunk of the book arguing the world is getting colder, but his parts about Brazil are worth remembering. Here are his main points: There you have it. We'll be sure to check back with Davidson in 50 years to see if he's right.
">Jay Yarow/Business InsiderFifteen years ago, the economist Paul Krugman offered Japan some unsolicited advice. To bolster the economy, he said, the country should embark on a course of “irresponsible” monetary policy. It wasn’t as crazy as it sounds. What he meant was that the Japanese economy was in such dire straits that the country’s central bank needed to do more than simply expand its balance sheet further—namely, he said, the Bank of Japan needed to very publicly embrace an inflationary monetary policy and let financial markets know they were in it for the long haul. The problem Japan faced, Krugman said, was that expansionary monetary policy had stopped working. With interest rates already near zero and private demand so weak that people didn’t want to borrow even at extremely low rates, increasing the money supply wasn’t providing the same incentives it usually might for consumers to start spending, thereby nudging up inflation. But a bigger problem was that investors didn’t really believe that the government was prepared to commit to the sort of extraordinary, long-lasting monetary expansion that would result in equally long-lasting price increases. Instead, the suspicion was that central bankers would revert to trying to keep prices stable as soon as inflation began to take hold – after all, the only thing worse to a central banker than deflation is the prospect of lighting the fuse that causes runaway inflation by keeping monetary policy too loose for too long. As it turns out, investors were right to be skeptical. The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates in 2000, while prices were still falling. In normal times, keeping inflation in check would be a responsible goal, but to that point, such an approach had kept the Japanese economy from emerging from a deflationary, stagnant slump. A decade and a half later, Japan is still struggling with deflation and sluggish growth, but it has finally adopted the kind of inflation targets that Krugman and others pushed for in the 1990s. Japan’s central bankers and government officials have already taken dramatic action (including a significant devaluation of the yen) this year, but Japanese policymakers are still receiving advice from experts advocating even more aggressive government intervention than “responsible” guidelines might dictate. That includes Credit Suisse’s Chief Economist for Japan, Hiromichi Shirakawa, who has called for the country to quit worrying about its soaring debt and focus wholeheartedly on pulling Japan out of its seemingly unshakeable cycle of deflation. In other words, to do things that might in normal times be considered irresponsible. “We believe that Japanese policymakers have reached the point at which a certain level of ‘credible irresponsibility’ is needed,” Shirakawa wrote in a June research note. “It has appeared, in our view, that ‘disciplined’ or ‘responsible’ policy might fail to eradicate stubborn deflationary pressures and breathe life back into the Japanese economy by fostering an increase in the expected inflation rate.” What would credible irresponsibility look like? Shirakawa wrote that the Bank of Japan should increase purchases of risky assets to convince investors that the “quality of its balance sheet is set to deteriorate.” Such actions, along with postponing planned consumption tax hikes set to take effect next year, could foster growth by boosting the expected inflation rate, which would then theoretically spur consumer spending and further weaken confidence in the yen, he said. Japanese leaders have already taken steps in that direction. Shortly after he took office in December, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe implemented “Abenomics,” a strategy consisting of monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy and, more recently, proposals to boost long-term growth. In January, the government announced a $110 billion stimulus package aimed at driving up private investment. And in April, the Bank of Japan unveiled a plan to purchase government bonds and inject an unprecedented $1.4 trillion into the economy. Investors in Japanese equities responded enthusiastically to the moves, and stocks were up 50 percent year-to-date through late May. But then the U.S. temporarily spoiled the party, with the May 23 release of Federal Reserve minutes that focused investors the world over on the eventual end of Ben Bernanke’s own monetary stimulus program. Japanese stocks fell nearly 8 percent that day, and fell a further 14 percent before bottoming out on June 13. Along with other temporarily rattled markets, the Nikkei 225 index did eventually reverse direction, climbing 17 percent from the June low through July 19, when stocks were still up 40 percent year-to-date. The “irresponsible” program has clearly had some of the desired short-term effects: For one thing, exports have become more competitive as the yen has dropped about 15 percent in value against the dollar year-to-date, moving from ¥86.6 per dollar at the start of the year to ¥99.7 as of July 18, and 26 percent over the past year. Gross domestic product rose a stronger-than-expected 1 percent in the first quarter, and, perhaps most importantly, the country’s stubborn deflation appears to have been halted. In May, Japan’s year-on-year core consumer price index rate, which excludes food, stopped falling for the first time since October – prices, in fact, stayed exactly the same as they were the previous year. Credit Suisse expects that number to turn positive in the third quarter. But concerns remain that any weakening resolve toward irresponsibility would result in the improvements being short-lived. “If the yen keeps weakening, the Nikkei keeps going up and inflation expectations keep rising, the Bank of Japan may not have to do anything,” Ray Farris, Credit Suisse’s Head of Asia-Pacific Fixed Income Strategy, said on a conference call last week. “[But] we think that’s unlikely.” Indeed, most analysts are skeptical that Japan can rebound from 15 years of persistent deflation and reach the central bank’s inflation target of 2 percent in the next two years. In particular, planned increases in the consumption tax set for April 2014 and October 2015 could seriously hurt growth, Shirakawa said. The last time Japan raised the consumption tax—it was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent in 1997—the country entered a recession. And the current plan to increase the rate to a full 8 percent might also slow growth, though probably not enough to dip into negative territory. Shirakawa said on the conference call that if the increase goes into effect as planned – an outcome to which he assigns a 70 percent probability – growth will slow in 2014 and inflation will remain between 0.5 and 0.8 percent over the next two years. The main question is whether Japan can stay the irresponsible course. Recent comments by some Japanese policymakers indicate a growing unease with the country’s large debt burden. Eighty percent of the assets on the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet are Japanese government bonds, while most of the loans on its books – about 15 percent of total assets – are also backed by the country’s sovereign bonds. With such a great portion of the value of Japan’s bank notes dependent on the value of the government’s debt, it is perhaps understandable that the Bank of Japan has been trying to assure markets that the government intends to honor those obligations, even if it means raising taxes and cutting costs. If markets lost confidence in the country’s ability to service its debt, yields on government bonds could rise and increase the country’s debt even further. But emphasizing fiscal austerity to address Japan’s deficit, as some government officials and central bankers have done lately, Shirakawa said, “has ultimately served to exacerbate deflationary expectations.” While undoubtedly sound from a long-term perspective, such discussion sounds all the wrong notes in the short-term, as the likely result would be a strengthening of the yen and further deflationary pressure, in the process directly counteracting Abenomics’ goal of boosting inflation and growth. What the central bankers should be talking about instead, argued Shirakawa in the recent note, is buying bonds with longer maturities. That would push down rates for longer-term loans, without necessarily causing the yen to rise or prices to continue falling.  The central bank should also consider buying riskier assets, such as low-quality real estate, to convince the market that it is serious about lowering the quality of its balance sheet. And most importantly, the Japanese government should hold off on the planned consumption tax increases. The recently approved so-called “third arrow” of Abenomics, which takes aim at some of the structural problems facing Japan’s economy, disappointed many market watchers by not loosening key labor market bottlenecks, such as a strict immigration policy and restrictions on firing workers. But Shirakawa noted that such changes are geared more toward Japan’s long-term future, rather than solving the country’s immediate problems. For now, the impact of structural reforms is much less important than the “credibly irresponsible” monetary policy that Credit Suisse hopes to see the central bank adopt in the near future. Just how likely is credible irresponsibility? Shirakawa noted that officials may need to see a further selloff in stocks and a stronger yen before implementing the measures he advocates. Without either, there is less urgency for dramatic moves: At the bank’s July 10-11 meeting, central bankers said the economy was starting to recover, and left monetary policy and the 2 percent inflation goal unchanged. But Credit Suisse analysts believe additional easing could come as soon as September, coincident with the likely beginning of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pullback on monthly purchases of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. If the U.S. tightens monetary policy just as Japanese central bankers open the money spigot, the yen could weaken significantly against the dollar – and that would be good for Japan, at least in the short term. “Yen weakness is really quite essential to the Bank of Japan’s ability to meet its inflation target of 2 percent,” said Farris, the Asia-Pacific fixed income strategist. “Either the yen weakens further on its own volition because of what the Bank of Japan is already doing, or the Bank of Japan is going to have to ease again.”
 A Girl With Tea/FlickrRegardless of where you may reside here in the States (or elsewhere in the northern hemisphere), one thing is for certain. Summer is here and it is hot. Whether you’re wearing a suit on Wall Street or rocking Silicon Valley casual, it can be hard to keep yourself looking composed after a foray into the blistering heat and humidity. But that isn't to say you have to look like a sweaty mess any time you get indoors. Here are a tips for staying fresh that you can use wherever you are.
TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling bloc won a decisive victory in an upper house election on Sunday, cementing his grip on power and setting the stage for Japan's first stable government since the charismatic Junichiro Koizumi left office in 2006. The victory gives the hawkish leader a stronger mandate for his "Abenomics" recipe to revive the economy and spells his personal political redemption after he led his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to a humiliating defeat in a 2007 upper house election.  The ensuing parliamentary deadlock allowed the opposition to block legislation and led to Abe's resignation two months later. That "twisted parliament" has hampered policies for most of the six years since and led to a string of revolving-door leaders. "People wanted politics that can make decisions and an administration with a stable grounding, which led to today's result," LDP Vice President Masahiko Komura told public broadcaster NHK. "'Abenomics' is proceeding smoothly and people want us to ensure the benefits reach them too. That feeling was strong." Abe, 58, who returned to power after a big win in December's lower house poll for his LDP and coalition partner New Komeito, has said he will remain focused on fixing the economy with his "Abenomics" mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms. But some worry that Abe's resolve for economic reform could weaken in the face of a resurgent LDP. A landslide victory could bolster opposition to regulatory reform from LDP lawmakers with close ties to industries that would suffer from change. Critics also worry Abe will shift focus to the conservative agenda that has long been central to his ideology, and concentrate on revising the post-war pacifist constitution and recasting Tokyo's wartime history with a less apologetic tone. Such a shift, along with moves to strengthen Japan's defense posture, would further fray ties with China and South Korea, where bitter memories of Japan's past militarism run deep. Tokyo is already engaged in tense territorial rows with Beijing and Seoul over tiny, uninhabited islands. "I have the impression that Prime Minister Abe wants to revise the constitution, though I don't think it will be easy," said apparel firm employee Etsuko Yamada, 35, who voted for the opposition Japanese Communist Party. "I want him to show Japan's presence through diplomacy with strong negotiating power, not though military power by spending money to rearm." YASUKUNI SHRINE TEST Abe has declined to say whether as premier he will visit Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, where Japanese leaders convicted by an Allied tribunal as war criminals are also honored. A visit on the August 15 anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two would spark outrage in the region. A Reuters poll showed Japanese firms generally wanted the LDP to win the election but they worry a landslide victory would allow Abe to prioritize nationalist policies over the economy, as critics say he did during his troubled 2006-2007 term. Final results will be known late on Sunday or early on Monday. Media exit polls showed the LDP and New Komeito would win more than 70 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the 242-seat upper house. With the coalition's uncontested 59 seats, that hands it a hefty majority, solidifying Abe's grip on power and raising the chances of a long-term Japanese leader for the first time since the reformist Koizumi's rare five-year term ended in 2006. No election for either house of parliament need be held until 2016. The exit polls showed, however, that the LDP fell short of winning an upper house majority in its own right for the first time since 1989, although it could put in a better performance than in 2001, when the party was led by the popular Koizumi, broadcaster NHK said. The LDP and two smaller parties that back Abe's drive to revise Japan's pacifist constitution to legitimize the military looked to fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to take revisions of the charter to a public referendum, the exit polls showed. Those parties have two-thirds of the lower house seats. Despite the LDP-led bloc's win, the party's pro-nuclear power stance is unpopular, and plans to restart reactors that have been off-line since the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster could run into trouble. Abe will also have to decide whether to go ahead with an increase in a 5 percent sales tax to 8 percent next April, the first stage in a planned doubling of the levy to rein in Japan's massive public debt. The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which surged to power in 2009 to end more than half a century of almost non-stop LDP rule only to be ousted last year, suffered its biggest drubbing since its founding in 1998. Exits polls showed the party winning 21 or fewer seats. The result raises concern about prospects for a competitive two-party democracy. Many anti-LDP voters, faced with a fragmented opposition, cast their ballots for the Japanese Communist Party to vent their frustration.

Deirdre Wang MorrisWhen the markets are up, everyone is excited about investing. When they are down, not so much. As a seasoned investor (I’m talking decades) and student of investment research, I've learned it is a fact that long-term historical stock market returns average about 9% per year. That looks enticing given the anemic returns on cash today. Investing in equities has proven to be an excellent way to build wealth over the long term. Over the short term, not exactly. So, what is the first rule of investing? Some might say it is this: take your funds to a local discount broker and buy 100 shares of a top performer. But is that really wise?   According to stockpickr, a 2012 top S&amp;P 500 stock performer was Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Does this mean you should rush out to buy shares in Bank of America? Before you open up your laptop, realize that BAC was among the worst performers in 2011. Are you certain that it will continue its upward movement? Picking the top performers of last year is not the recipe for success. First off, if a stock was a great performer last year, it’s likely to sport a frothy valuation. Bank of America has a price/earnings ratio of 40. Do you really think that one dollar of BAC’s earnings is worth $40? When a stock is a top performer one year, its price gets bid up to unreasonable levels and it becomes overvalued. So, picking a top performer last year is not the first rule of investing. Then what is the first rule? Before I tell you, consider this: Given the recent upswing in stock prices, the pull is to get in and start picking stocks or funds. Your mind is telling you not to sit on the sidelines or you will miss out. Let’s look at a very real scenario. You take $5,000 and put it in a diversified stock index fund this week. Since markets are volatile, after a big run up like that of the past four and a half years it’s normal to have a correction. Flash forward to the end of 2013, and imagine your stock fund has declined in value to $4,000 for a 20% loss. Will you be so upset that you sell and take the 20% loss in order to avoid further pain? Will you be afraid that the value of your investment will continue to decline? Do you know how you will react? Because that's the first rule of investing: Know your risk tolerance. In any one year, your investments can go up from a few percent on up to 30% -- or even higher on occasion. That’s not a problem. The issue is when stocks have a drop of the same amount in one year. If you cannot stay invested throughout the ups and downs, your returns will suffer. The research is clear: Trade more often and reap lower returns. You must know your risk tolerance before you begin investing. If you lose sleep and jump to sell at any sign of a market decline, then you are very risk averse. In that case, having a large proportion of your investment portfolio in individual stocks or stock funds may not be for you. So how do you determine your risk tolerance? There are many risk quizzes available to help determine what percent loss you can tolerate in your portfolio without rushing to sell. Examine your prior reaction to market declines. If you cannot sleep when your investments decline, then you don’t want 80% of your investment portfolio in equities.  If you can handle only a small decline, such as 5%, then create a portfolio weighted toward cash and bond investments and lighter on the equities. If there is a long time until you need your invested assets and you can weather a drop of 15 to 20%, decrease your cash and bond investments and ramp up exposure to the stock markets. via InvestingAnswers This moderately aggressive portfolio has two thirds invested in diversified stock funds and one third in a Treasury inflation-protected bond fund. The U.S. stock fund and the international stock fund offer great diversification but little protection against international stock market corrections. In a steady-interest-rate environment, the inflation-protected bond fund will hedge against some of the stock market volatility. This portfolio is for someone who is less risk averse. If you are prepared and informed about the potential downturns in the market -- and you can stay invested -- you are on the path to becoming a successful investor. If you cannot tolerate periodic losses or are approaching retirement, stick with a portfolio weighted toward Government I Bonds, cash and conservative bond investments. The Investing Answer: Before investing a dime (or more), determine your risk tolerance. Use your prior experience (How did you react when your investments dropped in value?), or check out this Risk Quiz developed by two finance professors at Rutgers University. P.S. -- Does the market's volatility keep you on edge? My colleague Elliott Gue and his staff recently went looking for the absolute best stocks on the market. The goal -- to find stocks good enough to buy, forget about and hold "Forever." After six months and $1.3 milllion worth of research, the team was successful.
