Thomson ReutersA customer holds a nozzle to fill up his tank in a gasoline station in NiceBy Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude held below $60 a barrel near a 5-1/2-year low on Friday as a global oversupply of oil showed little sign of receding, even as companies cut upstream investments next year. Oil prices were on track for a fourth straight week of declines after OPEC members last month decided against cutting production in response to a drop of nearly 50 percent in prices since late June. Brent crude for February delivery  was up 4 cents at $59.31 a barrel by 0341 GMT (10:41 p.m. EST). The contract had settled down $1.91 on Thursday, after trading as high as $63.70 a barrel in a volatile session. "Following the long and steep decline in oil prices, we have seen some buying interest in recent days," said Ken Hasegawa, commodity sales manager of Newedge Japan. "But there is still a lot of selling pressure." Oil companies have been announcing cuts in exploration and capital spending as crude's price decline makes projects uneconomical. "But for now there is no significant halt in production and no change to the supply and demand situation," said Hasegawa. "So oil prices can still go lower." Besides the $9 billion in spending cuts already announced, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie forecasts that, in order to maintain their debt levels, oil companies will need to reduce spending next year by another $170 billion, or 37 percent, from 2014 if Brent remains around its current level. At $60 a barrel, only three of the top 40 international oil companies generate sufficient free cash flow to cover spending, including distributions to shareholders, Wood Mackenzie said. U.S. crude for January delivery , which expires after Friday's settlement, was up 31 cents at $54.42, after rising to as high as $55.50 in earlier trading. Saudi Arabia's powerful oil minister said on Thursday OPEC could not cut output without the support of other big producers and attempts to get them on board had not worked. Ali al-Naimi said it was impossible for OPEC to cut alone to reverse the oil price slump, which he called temporary, when others were pumping more, saying that could lead to loss of market share, and with no guarantee of supporting prices.

Thomson ReutersLabourers work at a construction site for a new building in BeijingBEIJING (Reuters) - China has revised up the estimated size of its economy for 2013 by 3.4 percent to 58.8 trillion yuan ($9.5 trillion), the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, but said the revision will not affect economic growth this year. That marks an increase of 1.9 trillion yuan, or $305 billion, in the size of the Chinese economy that year, slightly below the entire gross domestic product of Malaysia during the same period, according to World Bank statistics. The increase was mainly due to an upward revision of contribution from the services sector. Services accounted for 46.9 percent of 2013 GDP, up from an initial estimate of 46.1 percent, while the secondary sector - which includes manufacturing and construction - accounted for 43.7 pct of GDP, down from 43.9 pct. China has been trying to improve its statistical system amid widespread scepticism about the reliability of its data. The statistics bureau said it was still revising the historical GDP data series, which could show revised economic growth for 2013 and previous years. "The revision of 2013 GDP could affect the size of 2014 GDP but will basically not affect GDP growth for 2014," the bureau said in a statement. Some analysts had previously expected the GDP revision to make it easier for the government to meet its growth target of around 7.5 percent in 2014. The revised figure follows a new economic census, in which the bureau changed its methodology. But it did not say it had added research and development (R&amp;D) spending into GDP or revised the way it calculates the value of "housing services" that homes provide to their owners, as some economists reports had predicted it would. R&amp;D spending, which is around 2 percent of GDP, is officially classified as a business cost, not investment, in China. In 2013, the United States revised the way it calculated gross domestic product to include R&amp;D spending. The third economic census, which was published earlier this week, showed that the services sector had expanded at a faster clip than the manufacturing sector between 2009 and 2013. The past two censuses led to a 16.8 percent revision to 2004 GDP size and a 4.4 percent increase in 2008. China's economic growth weakened to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, and November's soft factory and investment figures suggest full-year growth will miss Beijing's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years.   (Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Jacqueline Wong) FREE AppDownload

(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department will sell its remaining 54.9 million shares of Ally Financial Inc &lt;ally.n&gt; acquired under the government's bailout of the auto lender, Ally said on Thursday. The stake is worth about $1.25 billion, based on Ally's Thursday closing price of $22.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Separately, Ally said in a regulatory filing that it had received a subpoena from the Department of Justice for information related to its subprime automotive finance lending practices. Ally also said in the regulatory filing it had agreed to voluntarily extend the statutes of limitation to allow the DOJ to continue its investigation related to representations made by Ally regarding Residential Capital, LLC, the company's former mortgage subsidiary, in connection with investments in Ally made by the Treasury Department under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Ally, the former financing arm of General Motors which was among the auto, housing and finance companies bailed out in 2009, said that with the sale of the government's remaining stake in the company it will exit TARP. Taxpayers injected $17.2 billion into the lender during the financial crisis because of its mounting losses from subprime mortgages. U.S. Treasury has already received $18.3 billion from its investment of $17.2 billion in Ally, the company said. The government sold the bulk of its stake when Ally went public last April. In noting the subpoena received from the Justice Department, Ally said in its regulatory filing that other financial institutions had disclosed receiving similar requests earlier this year. GM Financial, the in-house financing arm of General Motors Co &lt;gm.n&gt;, said in October it had received subpoenas from state attorneys general and other authorities over similar issues.   (Reporting by Kanika Sikka in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
(Reuters) - Clothing manufacturer American Apparel has been approached by private equity firm Irving Place Capital for a possible takeover, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The Los Angeles-based retailer received an expression of interest from Irving Place in the last couple of weeks, people familiar with the matter told the Journal, adding that the approach was initially rebuffed because of the low price. Irving Place then raised its price range to $1.30 to $1.40 per share. The board has yet to respond, the sources told the Journal. American Apparel declined to comment to Reuters. Irving Place could not be reached immediately for comment. American Apparel shares on Thursday closed at $1.00, up 31 cents, or 44.9 percent. In after-hours trading, the shares were up 4 percent. American Apparel this week fired Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney, ending a tenure racked with sexual assault allegations and scandal. The Journal also cited sources saying that Charney may seek legal action over this dismissal, complicating a sale of the company.   (Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersUnilever CEO Polman addresses the Climate Summit at the U.N. headquarters in New YorkBy Kanika Sikka (Reuters) - Unilever Plc's  U.S. division said it has withdrawn its lawsuit against food startup Hampton Creek over false advertising and unfair competition related to its Just Mayo product. Unilever, famous for its mayonnaise brand Hellmann's, had filed a suit against Hampton Creek earlier this year accusing the company of advertising Just Mayo, an eggless spread, as mayonnaise. Unilever alleged that the spread could not be defined as mayonnaise under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's definition as it did not contain eggs. Common dictionary definitions of mayonnaise similarly define mayonnaise as "a dressing made chiefly of egg yolks, vegetable oils, and vinegar or lemon juice," the company had said in its lawsuit. The case gained national attention when a petition on Change.org gathered 112,000 supporters asking Unilever to "stop bullying sustainable food companies." Neither company was immediately available for comment outside normal business hours. FREE AppDownload
Having noticed his tweet about the market's enthusiastic response to Wednesday’s Fed decision, Business Insider reached out to Mohamed El-Erian for his insights.  Here are his responses. Where you surprised by the FOMC decision? Yes, and in two ways: First that central bankers refrained from cleanly removing the “considerable period” language; and second that they adopted a rather complex formulation that gives them optionality but at the risk of market confusion. What did not surprise me is the challenge the FOMC is having in maintaining unanimity as it tries to navigate a tricky policy pivot in a gradual and measured manner – thus the large number of dissenters (three) which reflects more than these regional bank presidents wishing to place markers as they rotate off the voting group. How about the equity markets’ reaction? Impressive, really impressive. It speaks to the extent to which the Fed still influences stock markets around the world.  It also suggests that, at least from an equities’ perspective, the recent remarks of Fed officials and the resulting market positioning had in fact opened a window for the orderly removal of the “considerable period” language. And other markets? Whether its currencies or government bonds, there you get a sense of the larger influence of the underlying fundamentals. They seem more mindful of the increasing divergence within the advanced world as it relates to the prospects for economic performance and monetary policy. Should the Fed statement had included more on oil, Russia, geo-politics and Europe’s economic malaise? I suspect that these issues were all discussed at the FOMC meeting, and for good reasons. The Fed is trying to strike a delicate balance between responding to a broadly improving domestic economy and being cautious on account of headwinds from the rest of the world.  We will get a better sense of the content of their discussions once the minutes and, much later, the transcripts are released. As regards the FOMC statement itself, the Fed has historically focused almost exclusively on the domestic economy.   Mohamed A. El-Erian is the former CEO/co-CIO of PIMCO.

Plunging oil markets and faltering growth expectations around the world have raised fears about the sustainability of the current U.S. economic expansion. The economic data, though, suggest that these fears are largely unfounded. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, which is made up of 10 forward-looking economic and financial indicators, has not fallen since January and has been gaining momentum throughout the year. Until we see the LEI approach negative year-over-year growth, which has preceded the last seven recessions, the U.S. economy should continue to ride out the storm emanating from overseas.Guggenheim Partners FREE AppDownload
A combination of factors has driven oil prices down since midyear, and while oil prices could fall further in the next couple of months, we think they’re likely to rebound in 2015. If they don’t, there could be an even bigger surge down the road. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has been cut nearly in half, from a high of $107 per barrel in mid-June to under $60 per barrel in early December. What’s behind the decline? Global demand has been weak, and supply has surged. We’ve seen a relentless rise in US oil production from shale oil fields. Saudi Arabia kept its production up as Libyan supply miraculously recovered amid a three-way civil war. And Nigerian production unexpectedly recovered. The Short Term: Rebound Likely in 2015 We expect the price of oil to fluctuate over the next few months as the market grapples with difficult-to-analyze issues. Options markets imply a 15% chance that oil will fall another $10 per barrel by early next year, but shale-cost economics and OPEC budget math should result in prices moving back toward $80 per barrel by the end of 2015. Shale oil producers will delay projects if cheap oil makes them uneconomical. The lower the price, the more shale projects shelved—and the lower supply growth will be six to 12 months later. Few of the new shale wells planned for 2015 would break even economically at current oil prices (Display 1). AllianceBernsteinFalling costs and technological innovation may eventually reduce break-even points, but pricier financing has already raised them. The shale industry, on average, spends about $1.20 for every $1.00 of cash flow it earns. It makes up the difference through borrowing—often using high-yield bonds. The high-yield market, however, recognizes the risk from low oil prices, so the cost of financing has doubled in the past couple of months (Display 2)—if it’s available at all.AllianceBernsteinMajor oil-producing countries could also bring supply discipline in 2015. Few of them can sell oil at $80 per barrel or less without running massive budget deficits or slashing spending. Financial markets will likely balk at growing budget deficits for countries like Venezuela, and social spending cuts could bring popular unrest. The short-term alternative: a shared production cut among OPEC members and possibly Russia. It’s in their interest to see oil rise above $80 per barrel in 2015. The Long View: $150-Plus Oil Is PossibleIf prices decline further this year and don’t rebound in 2015, prices could spike dramatically three to five years out. Lower prices would accelerate the trend of projects being deferred for economic reasons. To make up for this lost supply, we estimate that OPEC would have to dip into its spare capacity, pushing prices up and bringing deferred shale projects back on line. If non-shale producers delay their longer-term projects for too long, even robust shale supply will struggle to meet demand five years out. As OPEC draws down spare capacity to dangerously low levels, even a minor shock could launch prices above $150 per barrel. If, on the other hand, geopolitical conditions prove calm, prices would still have to rise above $100 per barrel to compensate for the risk of a shock—and to attract enough investment to make up for years of underinvestment. Risks to a Longer-Term Oil Price IncreaseIf oil prices don’t rise modestly in 2015, we see three possible risks to our view of a sharper long-term increase: First, sanctions on Iran could be lifted, with the increased supply delaying upward price pressure. Second, the Saudis and the rest of OPEC could decide that the best way to maximize their revenue over the long run is to produce all-out forever; we don’t believe that such a shift is in their interest. Third, technological innovation in drilling technology could continue to make exponential leaps forward. However, the investment behind this level of innovation is more likely to come in a high-price environment than in a low-price one. The bottom line is that oil prices may be volatile over the next few months, but short-term downside risk is more than offset by longer-term upside potential. Long-term investors may want to consider adding exposure to long-term oil prices—either directly through long-dated energy futures or indirectly through long-horizon public and private energy equity.

Behavioral finance, which is often used to explain irrational moves in financial markets, emphasizes the importance of psychological influences on investor behavior. The work of researchers, including Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, has examined those influences to provide useful insights that help with better decision making. However, focusing on only the psychological drivers of irrational behavior may overlook important biological components that also destabilize financial markets. Irrational decisions, loss aversion, and mispriced risk have been linked to hormones found in the human body. These chemical messengers coordinate fight, flight, mating, feeding, and the struggle for status, and they have an impact on growth, metabolism, immune function, mood — and perhaps most importantly — memory, cognition, and behavior. Two specific hormones, testosterone and cortisol, come out in force during the excesses of bull and bear markets. John Coates, neuroscientist and author of The Hour Between Dog and Wolf, has suggested that biology played a major role in the 2008 global financial crisis, finding a “Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation” that male traders experience when under pressure. His work suggests that overly aggressive behavior, caused by elevated levels of testosterone during a bull market, leads to dangerous levels of risk in the financial system. Cortisol, a second hormone that Coates has found to be present during times of heightened uncertainty, can delay or weaken economic recoveries. Coates’ 2010 study found that testosterone is associated with reward, noting that traders had significantly higher testosterone levels on days when they made an above-average profit. However, excessive testosterone can make traders impaired and overconfident, leading to increasingly poor decisions as their risk tolerance is affected while their skill levels remain unchanged. In the same 2010 study, Coates found that elevated cortisol levels were connected to extreme risk aversion among traders. High cortisol levels can contribute to the risk aversion and “irrational pessimism” found among bankers and fund managers during financial crises, causing a paralysis that prevents them from effectively allocating risk capital. “Traders, risk managers, and central banks cannot hope to manage risk if they do not understand that the drivers of risk taking lurk deep in our bodies,” according to Coates. One way to offset biological changes driven by hormones could be to encourage a balance of men and women in a broader range of ages to participate in the markets. In an opinion published in The New York Times, Coates observed that “Women and older men have a fraction of the testosterone of young men, so if more of them managed money, we could perhaps help to stabilize the markets.” The effects of cortisol and testosterone are also influenced by relationship status — a University of Chicago study examining gender-based differences in risk taking found that marriage had a dampening effect on hormonal responses to psychological stress. Data generated by the growing number of fitness monitors and other user-tracking devices may be another way for money managers to counter the physical triggers that lead to irrational decision making. The idea of “The Quantified Self” is gaining popularity among data-driven enthusiasts carefully tracking their behavior and vital signs as they attempt to reach a state of maximum productivity. Their insights may discover new correlations between physical and mental states. As the physical changes accompanying excessive approaches to risk are identified, steps can be taken to prevent them. A different solution might be for banks to encourage appropriate levels of risk taking by linking compensation to a trader’s individual Sharpe ratio. According to Coates, looking more closely at the risks assumed in order to generate returns can identify skilled performers and expose reckless traders taking excessive risks, regardless of whether they are influenced by physical or mental drivers. At the the 68th CFA Institute Annual Conference in Frankfurt, John Coates will be discussing his work in greater detail. You can learn more at the conference website. FREE AppDownload
FlickrAs seasoned investors are well aware, financial markets and economic trends seldom move in straight lines. Nowhere was this old adage more evident than in the discrepancy between last week’s domestic economic data releases and the performance of the stock market. Although U.S. equities suffered their biggest one-week drop since May 2012 on the back of declining oil prices, American consumer confidence reached new post-recession highs, with retail spending for the month of November comfortably beating expectations. While the U.S. economic expansion continues to power forward, the international situation is becoming increasingly grim.The recent decline in the ruble, which Russia attempted to slow with a surprise rate hike of 6.5 percentage points to 17 percent, is reminiscent of the early stages of the 1998 Russian crisis. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has fallen behind the curve, Abenomics in Japan is stalling, and China is making the painful adjustment to slower growth. Nevertheless, while international events are likely to get worse and energy prices are likely headed lower, I don’t envision a larger economic malaise spreading to the United States in the near term. Understandably, investors are currently spending the majority of their time worrying about oil and where the price bottom is. The United Arab Emirates’ energy minister announced over the weekend that OPEC is standing behind its Nov. 27 decision not to cut the group’s collective output target of 30 million barrels per day, which highlights the blatant lack of pricing discipline within the organization. As oil continues its decline, pressure is increasingly mounting on credit markets, especially high-yield corporate bonds, where energy-related borrowers represent 15-20 percent of the market. The flip side is that as spreads widen, we get closer to the levels where large investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, start to see value in the high-yield market, which should help stabilize credit spreads. Ultimately, what investors should prepare for is an extended period of depressed oil prices. Oil still has substantial downside room to run before reaching a level of stability. Once stabilized, depressed oil prices will create another “tale of two markets”— companies with oil exposure and those without. FREE AppDownload
CNBC It shows the 10-year Treasury yield, with dotted lines representing analysts' forecasts. "Wall Street economists have been consistently wrong in their forecasts for the ten-year rate over the past decade," Slok writes. How many times in recent years have we heard folks say that rates have "nowhere to go but up"? Entering 2014, almost every financial pro out there was betting that the 30-year-old bond bull market would finally come to an end and send rates higher. So, what are these pros predicting for 2015? "The latest Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters predicts that ten-year rates in 2015 will go up to 3%; see the last dotted line in the chart," Slok notes. "Subtracting the average 12-month forecast error of 60bps from that number suggests that another estimate of where ten-year rates will be by the end of 2015 is 2.4%." Who knows? Maybe history won't repeat itself this time around. Deutsche Bank FREE AppDownload
ScreenshotIt almost seems like Uber's PR kerfluffles are on a schedule. Just as the company slips out of the news cycle for going after Pando Daily's Sarah Lacy, here comes another surge pricing scandal. This time, it was for jacking up prices during the Sydney hostage crisis. People got angry. Uber backtracked, and offered refunds and free rides out of Sydney for a while. But the outrage cycle had already begun, and now the internet is once again debating whether Uber is right to use surge pricing during times of emergency. Uber's position is in the tweet above: charging more incentivizes drivers to come on to the system, which increases supply at a time when there's excess demand. The popular argument on the other side is that it's not fair that only rich people can afford rides at times of overload. In a regular taxi system, which doesn't have surge pricing, you pay the same price, but must wait longer to find an empty taxi (if you can find one at all). This is essentially a lottery system — you have to wait until you are lucky enough to be near one of the few empty taxis in order to get one. The question is then, does "fair" matter in business?  I think the answer is both yes and no. Josh Barro is right here:  People get upset about Uber surge pricing because, when surge is on, a regular taxi is hard to find. Which is THE POINT OF SURGE PRICING. But at the same time, an emergency situation is not the same as rush hour.  For one thing, it's not clear that surge pricing even serves its intended function during an emergency. I like Matt Bruenig's take on this point:  In a situation where surges happen at predictable times, e.g. during rush hour or on weekends, drivers are able to schedule their "shifts" to take advantage of those times. But this is not true in an emergency situation that is, by its very nature, totally unpredictable. We have no idea whether and to what extent drivers who don't plan to be on the road at a particular time monitor the app to for surge opportunities and hustle out to capture them. It's plausible that they don't do it much at all. If surge pricing doesn't serve its function during those periods, and most customers are angry about it, what's the point? I suppose you could argue that Uber gets rich off of it, and that's the business reason for doing it. But in the true emergency situations in which Uber has responded with surge pricing, it's been a PR nightmare for the company. It reversed its decision in Sydney, and it reversed its decision during Hurricane Sandy. It doesn't matter if it tracks well with established economic theory, because it doesn't work out in reality.  Then, of course, there's the moral argument: should rich people have better access to safety than everyone else? As a business decision, this sort of doesn't matter. Uber is a private company, it can do what it wants. It can set its own prices. It can alienate its customers, and serve only the wealthy. There's a whole section of the economy that's built exactly for this purpose — no one is outraged that private jet pricing. Well, maybe some people are, but we're more or less comfortable with private jets being an out-of-reach transportation option for the masses.  But the point is that while Uber doesn't have a moral obligation as a company to treat its customers equally, it seems like this sense of morality is what is driving the outrage that then forces the company to backtrack and start refunding people who feel price gouged during emergency situations. Uber has the right to surge pricing in emergencies*, sure, but is there really any incentive to doing it?  * Except when it actually doesn't because it violates price gouging laws. FREE AppDownload

The firm has kept relatively quiet about the new complex, possibly "because Thomas played for the Seattle Seahawks, the current nemesis for the San Francisco 49ers and the team that handed the 49ers a 17-7 defeat on Sunday," writes Levaux. "People who were successful at professional sports are viewed by financial-service firms as hard-working, super-motivated individuals who are also strong team players, and management is about leading a team," Mark Elzweig, an executive search consultant, told Think Advisor. The Energy Sector Is Looking Like A Good Long-Term Investment (US Trust Investment)  "With about a 50% fall in oil prices since June, the energy sector is significantly attractive for long-term investment. Many companies within the sector are trading at levels discounting oil prices some 20% below current levels. We believe the energy sector — specifically, the oil service, infrastructure equipment, and large integrated companies — is one of the most attractive investment opportunities for the next few years," writes Christopher Hyzy, the chief investment officer of US Trust. Overall, US Trust believes that equities will outperform fixed income in 2015, and specifically US equities will outperform relative to other asset classes. With respect to emerging-market equities, US Trust see selective opportunities in Mexico and South Korea but is cautious about Russia and Brazil, which are under immense pressure right now. The Dollar's Going Strong Into 2015 (Merrill Lynch) "The US dollar has been one of the best-performing major currencies in 2014, with the Dollar Index (DXY) up roughly 10% at the end of November. We see further upside for the greenback going forward, especially against the euro and the yen," writes Ashvin B. Chhabra, the chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. A big theme going into 2015 is that the world's major economies will be diverging, and Merrill Lynch believes this will lead to continued support for the dollar's strength.  Additionally, the "improving fiscal health of the US and transformative changes such as the surge in US energy production," will also contribute to the strength of the dollar, according to Merril Lynch. A $300 Million Morgan Stanley Team Jumps Ship To Raymond James (Financial Planning)  A Morgan Stanley team with $300 million under it just left the big firm for Raymond James.

Big companies weren't shy about going public in 2014. "With 273 IPOs, 2014 was the most active period of issuance since 406 companies went public in 2000," noted the folks at Renaissance Capital IPO Intelligence. "It was the second year of uninterrupted IPO activity, up 23% over 2013, due to a doubling of biotech issuance." According to Renaissance Capital, the health care sector led the way with a whopping 100 IPOs. Think biotech stocks. "Despite the higher volume, health care proceeds rose just 2% over last year due to several large deals in 2013." Tech issuance was up 22% year-over-year with 55 IPOs "Proceeds of $85 billion, inflated by Alibaba’s $22 billion offering, were up 55% over 2013," Renaissance noted. "While various global events, such as Russia’s incursion into the Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, caused nervousness in global markets, they largely failed to disrupt the US IPO applecart." 2014 is going down as the biggest year for IPOs since the dotcom bubble.Renaissance Capital FREE AppDownload

IMDB / UniversalFor the second day in a row, stocks had their best day of the year. After a huge rally on Wednesday, stocks topped these gains on Thursday, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points and all of the major equity indexes adding more than 2.2%. This was the biggest two-day rally for stocks since 2011 and the biggest one day gain for the S&amp;P 500 since January 2013. On a percentage basis, the Dow logged its biggest one-day gain since 2011.  First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Thursday: 1. Crude oil fell again. For the second day in a row, crude oil futures staged rallies that were quickly reversed. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose to as much as $59 a barrel before falling all the way back towards $54, eventually settling at right around $55 a barrel.  2. The market was still digesting the Federal Reserve's latest policy statement released on Wednesday, particularly the change in the Fed's language. On Wednesday, the Fed dropped the phrase "considerable time" from its forward guidance, opting to say that the Fed would remain "patient" in beginning its cycle to raise interest rates. In a note to clients following the report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch outlined some of the points from Wednesday's commentary out of the Fed. The big takeaway? The Fed is going to raise rates next year.  3. In an afternoon email, the New York Stock Exchange's Rich Barry said the Santa Claus rally is back on.

We have just three words to describe how we think the market will close out 2014: Ho! Ho! Ho!" 4. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a three-hour press conference on Thursday, speaking on Russia's economy and the recent collapse of the Russian ruble. Some of the highlights from Business Insider's Pamela Engel include Putin's insistence that Russia would dig out of its economic crisis in two years, Putin's refusal to call the ruble's collapse a crisis, and Putin comparing the Russian invasion of Crimea to taking Texas from Mexico.  5. A report from Bloomberg on Thursday, however, made clear that for Russia's richest citizens, the recent economic downturn has been a disaster: in just the last year, the 20 richest Russians have lost a combined $62 billion in net worth. 6. We got labor market data this morning from the weekly report on initial jobless claims, which fell to 289,000 from 295,000 last week, while the four-week moving average of claims declined from last week. In a note to clients following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said that assuming the hiring side of the payroll equation remains strong, the trend in claims indicates payroll growth remains strong.  7. The December manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve missed expectations and was sharply lower from November's reading, though economists called last month's number "mind-boggling." The report still showed that businesses surveyed remained optimistic on their outlook for the next six months. 8. Activity in the US service sector slowed to 53.6 from 56.2 last month, the weakest headline reading since October 2013, but still indicating growth in the service sector. Markit's Chris Williamson said following the report that, "The slowdown is linked to weaker growth of new business as customers becoming increasingly worried about the economic outlook both at home and abroad, with the prospect of higher interest rates cooling demand alongside side rising global geopolitical concerns."

Goldman SachsJohn Waldron. In his new role, Waldron will work alongside Richard Gnodde and David Solomon. He will also be joining Goldman's Management Committee.  Waldron most recently served as the global head of investment banking services and client coverage for the bank. He was the banker who helped Rupert Murdoch split his media empire into two companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp. Waldron joined Goldman in 2000. He became a partner in 2002. Weinberg, a vice chairman of Goldman, will no longer focus on day-to-day management of the investment bank. Instead, he will focus on client development, according to the memo.  Weinberg, 57, joined Goldman in 1983. He became a partner in 1992.  Here's the memo about Waldron's promotion:  We are pleased to announce that John E. Waldron has been named co-head of the Investment Banking Division (IBD).  John, together with Richard Gnodde and David Solomon, will continue to support the growth of the firm’s global client franchise across our investment banking businesses.  John will join the firm’s Management Committee. John most recently served as global head of Investment Banking Services (IBS)/Client Coverage for IBD.  From 2007 to 2010, he was based in London, where he was first global co-head of the Financial Sponsors Group and then led IBS/Client Coverage.  Previously, he was co-head of Leveraged Finance from 2005 to 2007 and co-head of the Media and Entertainment Group from 2002 to 2005.  John joined Goldman Sachs in 2000 and was named partner in 2002. As a long-tenured leader in IBD and founder of the IBS Leadership Group, John has helped us to develop many of the firm’s most important client relationships and to drive our global coverage strategy.  He has been an influential voice on a number of firm wide and divisional committees, including the Firm wide Capital Committee, IBD Executive Committee, IBD Operating Committee, and IBD Client and Business Standards Committee.  John also serves as a member of the Americas Diversity Committee. Please join us in congratulating John on his expanded responsibilities and wishing him continued success.  And here's the other memo regarding Weinberg:  We are pleased to announce that John S. Weinberg, vice chairman of the firm, will focus on client development and initiatives across our major divisions.  We have asked him to work with us to identify and address areas and client relationships where we can advance our client franchise. His deep commitment to our clients provides a strong foundation to enhance opportunities to grow our client franchise even more through effective relationship development and management, including with respect to strategic initiatives.  During his more than 30 years at the firm, John has developed some of the longest standing and most important client relationships, advising clients on highly significant transactions.  For more than 12 years, John has provided strong and consistent leadership to the Investment Banking Division, and over that period, we have built and maintained leading market positions.  While John will continue to work with and advise his core banking clients, he will give up day-to-day management of the Investment Banking Division.  John will work with divisional leadership, including the Investment Banking, Securities and Investment Management divisions, to identify ways in which we can advance our client franchise.  John is a member of the Management Committee and the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee.  He has served as co-head of the Investment Banking Division since 2001.  John is also co-head of the Firmwide Recruiting Committee.

REUTERS/Mikhail Klimentyev/RIA Novosti/Kremlin Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R-L) speaks with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's State Duma speaker Sergey Naryshkin and Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.At a televised cabinet meeting today, Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev urged calm, suggesting that the country has enough money to weather the current economic storm.  “All the economic and production goals that you have set yourselves, the country has the currency resources to achieve them,” he said. That's been Vladamir Putin's bet this year. According to Bloomberg, the Russian president asked his advisors at the beginning of the year if the country could withstand the economic shock of invading Ukraine, and they said yes. But a currency reserve shouldn't be measured just by how big it is. As the ruble crisis continues this week, there are actually two key questions: Does Russia have enough reserves? The second question is: are those reserves liquid enough to be used if they need to be? “The level of reserves is a sacred figure for Putin,” former Kremlin advisor Gleb Pavlovsky told Bloomberg. Putin has built them up to their current levels (about $415 billion) since the currency crisis and default of 1998. Now the reserves are rapidly dwindling again. Here's where Russia's reserves stand, according to the Russian Central Bank: RCB The first thing to notice is that Russia has blown through about 20% of its foreign exchange reserves in the last year. The question is how much of the remaining chunk would actually be available if the Russians need to access it immediately. The Economist/Free Exchange via EconbrowserThe Economist took a crack at estimating the liquidity for the country's foreign reserves last week. From the post: "About $170 billion of its assets sit in two big wealth funds, the Reserve Fund (worth about $89 billion) and the National Wealth Fund (worth about $82 billion). But much of what is in these funds could prove inaccessible if called on to meet short-term financing needs." In other words, much of these funds are illiquid. They can't just be withdrawn like how one takes money out of an ATM machine. In this context, Russia hasn't burned through $100 billion out of $500 billion in reserves in the last year, but about $100 billion of $300 billion liquid reserves. According to Bloomberg, "the Bank of Russia will probably spend another $70 billion to defend the ruble" as it continuet to slide. That would leave the country with just over $100 billion left. Meanwhile, Paul Krugman has this to say about what's going on in Russia:  When you have big balance-sheet problems involving foreign-currency debt, an interest-rate hike that tries to discourage capital flight damages the economy, and hence those same balance sheets, from another direction, and it’s common, even standard, for the effort to fail. Most notably, tight-money policies were really really unsuccessful during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-8, on which you can read my take here. FREE AppDownload
 Executive bonuses often get ridiculous.  In light of that, Plum Creek Timber Co. CEO Rick Holley just did something quite admirable. He gave back 44,445 restricted-stock units, worth nearly $2 million.  According to a regulatory filing, "Mr. Holley elected to return the restricted stock units because he does not believe that he should receive such an award unless Plum Creek's stockholders see an increase in their investment return."  Plum Creek has hit some choppy water.  As observed by Dan Primack on Fortune, the timber company has had flat revenue for two years, with net income expected to fall this fiscal year. "It's hard to remember the last time a CEO voluntarily gave up stock as a sort of apologia to disappointed investors," Primack says.  If executives do anything with their bonuses other than squirrel them away, they often redistribute the money to their hardworking teams as a massive high five.  In 2013, for example, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing shared $3.25 million of his bonus with employees — equivalent to a month's salary for many Chinese workers — as a toast to the company's setting sales records two years in a row. That same year, Next CEO Lord Wolfson gave his $3.7 million bonus to his employees as "a gesture of thanks and appreciation from the company for the hard work and commitment you have given to Next over the past three years and through some very tough times." If Plum Creek can turn it around, maybe Holley can use his bonus for a celebratory share, too.       FREE AppDownload
FlickrYou can't go wrong with a gin martini.Gin is a mixing drink, but that doesn't mean that quality doesn't matter. The spirit, which derives its flavor (and its name) from juniper berries, is an essential component in a ton of cocktails, so you still want to be sure you're going for the good stuff. We consulted our friends at FindTheBest, who update their gin rankings regularly based on reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine and the Beverage Tasting Experience, as well as awards from the prestigious San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Here's their latest list – and they all happen to be $40 or less. Dry gins are so-named because virtually no sugar is added. The Aria Portland Dry Gin comes from American Samoa and is best mixed in a martini or jasmine cocktail. It has a silky, fruity body and smells of spices and pine blossoms. Ransom Old Tom is a genevere gin, a type of spirit that originated Netherlands or Belgium, although this particular genevere comes from the US. It's best mixed in a gimlet or martini. This smooth dry gin comes from the Netherlands. It balances strong juniper flavors with a subtle sweet finish. Try it in a Tom Collins. The Rehorst is practically a whole herb garden in a bottle; it contains aniseed, basil, cardamom, cassia, coriander seed, juniper, and lemon and orange peel. The sweet basil ingredient is especially unique; it adds an extra dash of floral flavoring to the gin. Though Voyager is a London Dry style gin, it's hand-crafted in the US. Made from grain spirits and organic herbs and spices, it's artisan distilled in the 19th century style. The Africa-inspired Whitley Neill features two African botanicals (and a baobab tree on the label). It's made in the UK and has bold, warm flavors. The Monopolowa is a London Dry but it comes from Vienna, Austria, and it's triple distilled and especially smooth. You don't have to spend a lot of money to get quality gin: the New Amsterdam is one of the more affordable bottles on this list, but it's a three-time Gold/Double Gold winner at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It's a modern gin that comes from the U.S. and it has subtle citric flavors and a silky finish. Miller's calls this "one of the most aromatic and least junipery gins." It smells, instead, of cucumber, white, pepper, and lemon zest, and even contains a bit of nutmeg and liquorice. Try it in a Martinez cocktail. Tanquery 10 is a classic. It's the only gin out there made from handpicked fresh fruit, including grapefruits, oranges, and limes. It's won fully six Double Golds from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, and it's not going to break the bank either. You cannot go wrong. FREE AppDownload

To start your day off with a happy hypothetical, let’s say you’ve been following our advice on how to build a buffer account. It’s going so well that now you’ve got a little money you’d like to invest. “Great — I’m going to get started today!” you think. Then you Google “How do I get started investing?” and learn that you can choose from thousands and thousands of mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, bonds, brokerages, and asset classes. “Hmm, I’ll get started investing tomorrow. Today: Candy Crush.” I know how you feel. Last month I was in Japan, and my earbuds broke. So I went to a big electronics store, figuring they’d have a few to choose from. Did they ever. I spent over an hour trying out earbuds before buying a new pair of the same ones that broke. I can’t help you choose headphones, but whether you have $100, $1000, or $10,000 to invest, I can help you get started. In investing, as in headphones, “good enough” is better than driving yourself crazy figuring out the perfect solution. Buy one share of a stock market Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and a good introductory book on investing such as "The Elements of Investing," by Malkiel and Ellis. Which ETF should you buy and where? Let me make it easy. Open an account with TD Ameritrade. Opt into the commission-free ETF program. Buy one share of the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) for about $59. Congratulations! You now own (a piece of) 5351 different stocks from about 50 countries. Now, read the investing book and keep saving money. Why TD Ameritrade? They make it easy to get started with a low balance without zinging you with fees. Another option: Betterment.com has a extremely simple sign-up process and will let you invest the whole $100. They do charge higher fees than TD (the fees decrease as your investment increases) and require you to invest an additional $100/month minimum until you hit $10,000. Open an account at Vanguard (make it an IRA or Roth IRA if you’re eligible to contribute to one) and put $1000 in the target-date fund of your choice. These funds are cheap and own a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Go ahead and drop another $20 on that investing book (or get it from the library). You’ll learn that even with a low-cost, diversified portfolio, sometimes you’ll lose money. Sometimes a lot of money. That’s no reason to avoid investing. It’s a good reason to control what you can (keep costs low, diversify, and avoid active management), invest according to your risk tolerance (don’t own 100% stocks if you won’t be able to sleep at night), and stay calm when everyone else is panicking. The Vanguard target-date fund is still an excellent choice. In fact, it would still be an excellent choice if you had $1 million to invest. Wealthy folks have access to special investment opportunities that the rest of us don’t. Lucky for us, those special opportunities (such as hedge funds) are usually much worse than the boring mutual funds and ETFs we have to settle for. Another option: Wealthfront is a snazzy automated investment management site with a $5000 minimum and no fees for the first $10,000. It’s easy to get started, and they offer some tax management features that Vanguard doesn’t. If you have a 401(k) at work, you’re probably better off investing there than in your own account. You might get an employer match, and once you set up payroll deduction, you’ll keep saving automatically without thinking about it. "The Elements of Investing" can help you choose good funds in your 401(k). As you accumulate more money in your investment accounts, the rules of good investing don’t change. They just get more important. There’s a big different between losing $100 and losing $10,000 (or $100,000, or more). Now, if anyone can explain to me how to prevent my headphones from breaking all the time, I’m all ears. (Groan.) FREE AppDownload

 Carl Icahn is going to keep the lights on at Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal.  In a letter to Trump Entertainment Resorts CEO Robert Griffin posted on his Shareholder Squaretable website, Icahn said: ...I cannot be so callous as to let 3,000 hardworking people lose their jobs while a global settlement with the State and Union, which would enable us to turn the Taj around, as we’ve done with so many other failing businesses, remains a possibility. Therefore, even though I have no assurance that the State will provide aid or that the Union will drop its appeal, I will send you a commitment letter to provide you with up to $20 million of additional financing (in accordance with your budget and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein) to keep the Taj operating throughout the bankruptcy proceedings, and I will also commit to work collaboratively with the State, the City and the Union to try to forge a global settlement that will bring real stability to the Taj and its employees. Back in October, Icahn told the Associated Press that the Trump Taj Mahal would "almost certainly close." According to the AP, Icahn, who owns Atlantic City's Tropicana Casino and Resort, "was approached by Trump Entertainment about canceling the $286 million in company debt he owns and converting that into ownership of the Taj Mahal." Over the last two months, Icahn has issued several letters, which are posted on his Shareholders Squaretable website, addressed to Taj Mahal employees and union leadership.  Here's the full text of Icahn's letter: Dear Bob: I received your letter requesting further aid and assistance in your attempts to keep the Trump Taj Mahal open, and I would like to respond. I do not typically shy away from a challenge.  In fact, I take great pride in my ability to successfully rebuild failing businesses.  As you correctly pointed out, a few years ago I took a chance at the Tropicana by investing when others would not, and today the Tropicana is a profitable, viable casino that provides stable employment for almost 3,000 workers.  In addition to gaming, I’ve also had tremendous success rehabilitating businesses in other industries, including oil and gas, metals and real estate. But Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc. is one of the most distressed companies I have ever come across in my 50+ years of investing.  The company’s hometown of Atlantic City is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis.  Intense competition from surrounding markets is steadily eroding gaming revenues for the city’s casinos.  At the same time, relative to those surrounding markets, the costs of operating a casino in Atlantic City continue to escalate.  As a result, four local casinos shuttered in 2014, and a once vibrant Atlantic City institution, your Taj Mahal, loses almost $10 million every month. Despite all of that, and in part because of the tremendous integrity you have displayed throughout this difficult and arduous process, I took your letter to heart.  I worked tirelessly with my team over the last few days – reviewing and re-reviewing the numbers you provided us, trying to find some way to help you keep the Taj operating.  I also had countless discussions with representatives of the State and the Union, and at one point, I genuinely believed we were close to a global settlement.  But ultimately, even though I committed to inject another $100 million of capital into the Taj, we could not get a deal done. Now, I want to be clear that I am in no way “anti-union” (as some may suggest).  I grew up in one of the roughest neighborhoods in Queens, and I’ve worked hard every day of my life to get to where I am.  So I respect people who want the opportunity to work hard and better their lot in life, which is why I often have a good relationship with labor leaders at the companies I own.  It’s also the reason why, despite some questionable decision-making from this Union’s leadership over the last few months, I remain hopeful that I will be able to reach a deal with them. Even though I believe that Atlantic City will be great again someday, many people would still argue that it would be a better financial decision for me to let the Taj close and wait to see whether a global settlement can be reached.  But I cannot be so callous as to let 3,000 hardworking people lose their jobs while a global settlement with the State and Union, which would enable us to turn the Taj around, as we’ve done with so many other failing businesses, remains a possibility.  Therefore, even though I have no assurance that the State will provide aid or that the Union will drop its appeal, I will send you a commitment letter to provide you with up to $20 million of additional financing (in accordance with your budget and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein) to keep the Taj operating throughout the bankruptcy proceedings, and I will also commit to work collaboratively with the State, the City and the Union to try to forge a global settlement that will bring real stability to the Taj and its employees.      FREE AppDownload
"Disinflation." As oil prices have cratered over the last several months, they've taken inflation down, too.  But the decline in prices isn't being talked about a outright deflation — or falling prices — but disinflation, meaning slowing inflation.  On Wednesday, the consumer price index for November declined 0.3%, largely due to a 6.6% decline in gas prices. (Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1%, which is still less than the Fed would like, but still below what the Fed would like to see.) And with oil prices still at five-year lows, this trend is likely to continue. Meanwhile, market-based measures of inflation have declined to multi-year lows, with two-year breakevens — which represent the market's expectations for inflation in two years' time — falling into negative territory on Thursday, according to Bloomberg. In her press conference on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stressed that the Fed views the recent decline in prices spurred by the drop in oil as "transitory," adding that the Fed still expects prices will move back towards its 2% over the longer term. And so while the eurozone is fighting off outright deflation, which some analysts expect could come to the economic bloc next year, in the US at least, we're still staying away from using what many in the market call "the D word": deflation.  On Twitter, Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal noted the recent surge in media stories containing the word "disinflation" (which I guess is now higher by one), which is at the highest level since the early 2000s.  So when talking to friends and family about inflation measures during this holiday season, "disinflation" is the word you're looking for.  @TheStalwart FREE AppDownload
Billionaire Peter Thiel, widely known as one of the founders of PayPal, is perhaps most strongly influenced by his experience as a professional chess player. In his book  "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How To Build the Future," he outlines his theory on "last mover advantage."  His advice goes against the popular theory that being the first one to enter the market is one of the most important tactics for building a successful company.  Instead, he advises startups to view their business model like a game of chess and focus on their long-term vision.  Here, he goes into greater detail and provides a concise explanation of the two other major themes from his book.  Produced by Alana Kakoyiannis and Graham Flanagan.

So you just closed your first big deal and it's time to celebrate. Your boss invites you upstairs to the boardroom where the executives are lined up at the long oak conference table, premium cigars by their sides to mark the occasion.  One by one they light up, oaky musks wafting, and finally it's your turn to spark your earthy blend. There's just one problem—you're totally clueless. "The smoking is supposed to be the fun part," said Michael Herklots, world-class tobacconist and VP of retail and brand development at Nat Sherman, a cigar emporium in midtown Manhattan. "The last thing you want to do is fumble — to light or cut the wrong end." How does one avoid these fatal flubs? We sat down with Herklots to find out the best ways to prove your worth when it comes time to lighting up the celebratory Maduro.  While the head honchos in the boardroom will be smoking heavier blends, it's important for you not to overdo it and cough up a storm. There's nothing wrong with choosing a premium mild cigar. Your bosses will respect you more for knowing what you want and not guessing blindly. That's where things can get dicey, says Herklots.  "The biggest mistake new cigar smoker make is in the format they pick," he says. "New smokers tend to smoke something shorter, thinner, and overall, smaller. The problem with this is that the shorter a cigar is, the closer the hot part is to your mouth. It gets hotter faster, which is not a pleasant experience if you're starting out." Herklots makes an analogy here to using a regular straw versus a cocktail straw. With a regular straw, you have a wide cylinder with a long body that allows you to draw substance out over a longer period of time. If you use a cocktail straw, on the other hand, the experience is more aggressive and concentrated. The same goes for cigars. A long, fat cigar is a milder, cooler, and longer-lasting cigar. A shorter one is an intense experience better enjoyed by veteran smokers.  Shutterstock.comAll hand-rolled cigars are closed off with a cap to ensure that they don't unravel and dry out. Removing this cap is essential to a good smoke, and there are a few ways to do so, none of which are wrong. Herklots, though, recommends the straight cut made by a guillotine cutter. A tip he shared with us involves laying the cutter flat down on a surface and then bringing the two blades in and clipping the head. By placing the guillotine on its belly, smokers can ensure they don't over-cut the cigar. Trying to smoke an uncut cigar is a sure-fire way to make a fool of yourself. You want to make sure you get your cigar cut, whatever the method may be.  You've mastered the cut and now it's time for the easy part: the light. While tobacconist Michael Herklots stresses the importance of just getting the cigar lit and ignoring expert nuances, he stresses the importance of avoiding one glaring mistake: using the incorrect type of lighter. Wooden matches are desirable. butane lighters work, but Zippos do not. Herklots warns that you DO NOT, under any circumstances, want to introduce foreign substances into your cigar. This will greatly affect the taste and your bosses will look at you askew if they see you flipping open your Zippo, about to ruin the $40 cigar they just handed you.  Eli Epstein / Business InsiderA well-cut cigarThe best strategy is to ask for a match box, take two matches, and then light them against the striker. Once this is done, place the cigar in your mouth and delicately puff on it while lighting the uncut end. With your free hand, rotate the cigar so it doesn't light unevenly. When the outer rim of tobacco begins to glow, you're good. Blow out the match and start shaking a few hands.   You will learn quickly that cigars are not meant to be inhaled. If you make the mistake of doing so, you will surely be met by a maelstrom of coughing and wheezing. This, let us warn you, is quite embarrassing. Those around you will know you don't share their sacred hobby. "You need to get used to the act of drawing and expelling without inhaling and exhaling," says Herklots. "Once you get it, it's about practice, but this is a hell of a lot more fun to practice than other things." Experts have mastered the breathing and exhalation patterns, but you don't need to be a connoisseur to learn how to do it the right way. Cigars are about taste, and to best appreciate their flavors, you need to draw slowly and infrequently, a few times per minute. Then, swirl around what you've taken in and let it reach the back of your mouth before gently expelling it. This way your whole mouth experiences the act. Even if you're not the most experienced smoker, your superiors will still appreciate your attention to detail and perspicacity when smoking. How does the cigar taste for you? Does it change taste as it's smoked? How is the smoke acting on your palate? Eli Epstein / Business InsiderCigars from the Nat Sherman Townhouse in New York City"Taste is the most popular way to talk about cigars, and there's no wrong answer," says Herklots. Cigars can be described by their strength, from mellow to strong, and their bodies, which Herklots describes as the taste when the smoke hits your palate. Your bosses will appreciate your interest in their hobby and their smoking experience, and it shows them you want to learn a bit more. Ask them the origins of their blend — where are the filler and binder from? What about the wrapper? Ask if they prefer Maduros to Claros (brownie points if you know these are wrapper types), or a Torpedo to a Robusto (cigar shapes).  Just don't be pedantic. This is a hobby for these guys. Unless you're in their circle, let them do the heavy lifting. With the deal closed and the cigar almost half-way smoked, you may want to put it out and call it a night. There's no shame in this; just don't treat the cigar like a half-eaten hamburger. You can't just doggy bag it. Once it's done, it's done. So if you find yourself finished, politely let the cigar burn out in the ashtray (don't demolish the wrapper and reveal its insides — this looks sloppy).  Then, try to schedule another smoking session with the higher ups. Chances are if you didn't embarrass yourself by lighting the wrong end or wheezing till no end, they'll want to invite you into their cigar cadre.  The original version of this post was written by Eli Epstein.

Retailers are aggressively marking down merchandise in a bid to get customers this holiday.  Major brands like Wal-Mart are offering far more bargains and promotions online this year than last, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.  Compared with last year, prices are 12% lower at Wal-Mart, 9.7% lower at Amazon, and 3.5% lower at Target, the firm reports.  The increased promotions could be a sign that consumers aren't shopping as much.  Black Friday sales plummeted this year, leaving retailers completely stumped.  After weeks of declining gas prices, many analysts predicted the biggest holiday season ever. Industry groups like the National Retail Federation reasoned that Americans would use their fuel savings on gifts.  Despite encouraging forecasts, Black Friday weekend sales were down 11%. Cyber Monday sales rose 8%, falling short of many predictions. Many analysts and executives have speculated that Americans are too worried about money to spend on gifts.  Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet told analysts that consumers had priorities other than clothing and housewares.  "Shoppers are spending more of their disposable dollars on categories we don’t sell, like cars, healthcare, electronics, and home improvement," Hoguet said in a call with investors. The stores that did remarkably well on Black Friday, like Family Dollar and Kohl's, are all deep discounters, according to another Deutsche Bank report.  The success of discount retailers shows that Americans are more concerned about spending money than ever.  Wal-Mart, however, provided few details about results from the weekend, a possible sign of bad news, the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. Many Americans are watching their spending despite lower gas prices, writes Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee.  "Consumers are increasingly familiar with energy price reprieve from summer gas prices and no longer adjust their long-term spending habits as much, or at all, based on short-term price fluctuations," Piegza writes.  And while gas prices are lower, the benefit is offset by higher housing and utility costs, according to Piegza.  Health insurance premiums have increased between 39% and 56% since early 2013, meaning additional costs of $230 per month for the average family.  The lackluster job market is also contributing to poor holiday sales, Piegza writes.  "With uncertainty lingering and patience wearing thin after five-plus years of still lackluster wage growth, consumers are increasing saving for the future, hedging against a continuation of 'more of the same,'"Piegza said. "Thus, for many, extra savings at the pump as a result of lower gas prices are simply being stored away to help supplement spending needs in the future, ramping up savings, not spending."

 Oracle's stock is up more than 8% Thursday to over $44, after the company reported better-than-expected sales and profits Wednesday. That's the highest the stock has been in years, and it approaches its all-time high of $45.46 from July 2000, during the heady days of the internet bubble. The reason why investors are so giddy? To paraphrase Meghan Trainor: "It's all about that cloud, 'bout that cloud ..." Oracle will sell "well in excess of $1 billion" of new annual cloud subscriptions next year, chairman and CTO Larry Ellison said during the quarterly conference with analysts. That $1 billion in new bookings is in addition to the $2 billion in cloud revenue it is already on track to earn this year (in the current quarter, it earned $516 million from cloud services). So by the end of next year, Oracle's cloud business should be on a $3 billion annual run rate, well on its way to hitting the major industry milestone of $1 billion per quarter. The $4 billion mark is a major milestone for cloud-computing companies. Microsoft in November said its cloud was on track to be a $4.5 billion business next year. But as we previously reported, that $4.5 billion number isn't straightforward and is influenced by how Microsoft bundles its products together when companies renew their software contracts. The pure cloud company Salesforce.com just hit over $4 billion in revenues in its most recent fiscal year and expects to hit $5.3 billion at the end of its current fiscal year. To get there, it took 15 years and a major acquisition, the marketing automation company ExactTarget. Amazon, the online retailer and cloud market leader, is about to pass $4 billion in revenue in 2014, too. (It doesn't report cloud revenue but does lump it into its "other" category, which hit $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014's first nine months.) To be sure, $1 billion, or even $3 billion a year, is peanuts compared with the $6.8 billion Oracle earned from its software business just last quarter. But cloud contracts are tallied differently. Companies pay less for them up front and more for them over time, and so cloud vendors can report the revenue only as it is earned. That $3 billion worth of bookings is really worth a lot more money over time. And most importantly, Oracle promises it is going to hit that $3 billion number while still growing its traditional software business — without cannibalizing it. In other words, it says that each quarter it is gaining hundreds of new customers, not just ones who are moving from regular software installed in their data centers (known as on-premises) to the cloud. Ellison says cloud customers are coming from those who would have chosen competitors Workday and Salesforce. And, he says, these companies are buying multiple cloud products from Oracle because Oracle has become a one-stop shop for everything, from hardware through every possible cloud product they might want. "Look at our product portfolio," Ellison said on the call. "Who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors always beat the point solution guys. It's happened in every generation of computing where the end user, the customer, doesn't want to be the integrator of 30 separate applications from 30 separate vendors. No different now, just on the cloud now." All told, co-CEO Mark Hurd says the company added 860 new software-as-a-service customers last quarter, with more than 230 of them ordering more than one cloud service. For its human-resources cloud that competes with Workday, Oracle signed on 230 new customers and nearly 150 new customers for its financial software cloud customers, he said. Better still, co-CEO Safra Catz promises that the company is doing this while preserving fat 46% operating margins. "I am very pleased with where margins are laid out this quarter, and as we get to volume, I actually think we are going to do better — continue to do better," she said. And that's a hugely sunny outlook for Oracle, which has wavered for the past few years as it revamped: overhauling its legendary sales force, learning how to become a hardware company, and building and acquiring its way into the cloud business, all while keeping its bread-and-butter database business alive.

Crude oil is has given up some gains. In early afternoon trade on Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were trading near $56.50, well off earlier highs near $59 a barrel.  This is a bit of a bounce, however, from late morning lows of around $55.50. Oil was adding some gains as the US stock market saw its own gains accelerate, with the Dow now up more than 300 points. On Wednesday, crude oil had a wild ride, spiking ahead of the Federal Reserve's announcement before giving up those gains.  Near dawn in New York, crude again rallied, but in following with Wednesday's pattern, these gains are evaporating.  Crude oil has crashed over the past several months, and the market is looking for the bottom in oil prices.  But for the second straight day, a crude rally seems to be failing.

RBC Despite Saudi Arabia's huge reserves, RBC writes that "a policy of keeping prices low for the prolonged period needed to put US shale producers out of business would essentially eliminate the country's reserves. According to the International Monetary Fund, if oil prices fall $25 below the Fund's $100-$105 reference case, with no spending adjustment, Saudi government reserves will be entirely depleted by 2018." If the Saudis are screwed by 2018, every other country on this list that relies heavily on oil revenue to balance its budget is probably going to see reserves depleted before then.    FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Heinz-Peter BaderSaudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi. In a new note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft takes a look at both the fiscal and external breakeven crude-oil prices for countries across the Middle East. Fiscal breakeven is the price required for countries to balance their budgets, while the external price is what is needed for a country to balance trade. OPEC's Thanksgiving decision to keep production unchanged put pressure on some of OPEC's more cash-strapped members like Venezuela, but Croft notes that Saudi Arabia, seen as OPEC's most powerful member, is still facing substantial spending commitments, largely related to an increase in defense spending since 2011. Croft evaluates breakeven prices assuming Brent crude is around $70 a barrel. On Thursday, Brent crude was trading closer to $60.  But either way, Saudi Arabia is well below its fiscal breakeven price of closer to $100 a barrel, and Croft adds that if prices persist at roughly $25 below Saudi Arabia's breakeven price, its government reserves could be depleted by 2018.  Amid the decline in oil prices, many have speculated that OPEC — in this case, operating as a proxy for Saudi Arabia — is looking to force US shale producers out of the market.  But this strategy might not all it's cracked up to be.  As Croft writes, "A policy of trying to permanently price out US shale could prove to be something of a mutually assured destruction strategy."

Thomson ReutersA man polishes the Volkswagen logo on a vehicle of an exhibition which is part of the annual shareholders meeting of Volkswagen AG in HamburgDRESDEN, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG  Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said Europe's largest carmaker would definitely be able to improve its results by 5 billion euros by 2017 as planned, according to a person close to management thinking who attended a conference on Thursday where Winterkorn was speaking. VW is seeking to cut 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) of costs by 2017 at its main car division where profit margins have languished amid a proliferation of models. Some of the improvements should come through efficiencies and leaner management and include, for example, cutting back management meetings, said the person, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. Winterkorn spoke to around 2,000 VW managers in the German city of Dresden at a closed-door strategy conference on Thursday.

Fashion executive Paula Schneider is the new CEO at American Apparel.  The brand officially terminated founder Dov Charney after allegations of misconduct. Schneider will start January 5.  "My goal is to make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, made in USA manufacturing philosophy," Schneider said in a company statement.  While Charney is an outrageous public figure with a knack for causing controversy, his replacement seems more low-key.  Investors seem to like Schneider — shares are up 30% since she was appointed.  Business Insider asked to interview Schneider, but American Apparel representatives denied our request.  Here's what we know about her so far, per her LinkedIn page.  She graduated from California State University — Chico in 1983. She minored in teaching.  Schneider has served as president for many top fashion brands, including BCBG Max Azria, Laundry by Shelli Segal, and Warnaco Swimwear group.  Schneider has served as senior advisor for a private equity group. This expertise could help her turn around finances at American Apparel, which has struggled with cash flow for some time.  Schneider has had her own retail consulting business for two years. This means it's possible that she's worked with American Apparel before.  Schneider has been actively involved in fundraising for years, especially through the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer.  FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesBen Bernanke. "One key question on our minds for 2015 is whether the decline in oil prices today, which will lead to negative headline inflation prints early next year, is sufficient to change the baseline outlook for monetary and fiscal policies we have already embedded in our growth forecasts," wrote PIMCO's Saumil Parikh and Dan Ivascyn in a new note published on PIMCO.com. Parikh and Ivascyn summarized Bernanke's response to that question: Dr. Bernanke affirmed PIMCO’s view that the outlook for the U.S. economy in 2015 is incrementally positive, reflecting improving household finances and confidence as well as increasing evidence that the economic recovery is becoming self-sustaining and broad-based. Even as the output gap closes, the economic expansion looks to have room to run, reflecting remaining slack in the labor market and a housing recovery still in its early stages. Further, Dr. Bernanke suggested that monetary policymakers are likely to remain deliberate. They will look past the drop in headline inflation in the U.S. next year, and will remain focused on the level and momentum of real growth as well as the progress of core inflation toward target in determining the proper future course of monetary policy. There's not a lot of specificity there. However, they do note that the chairman is on board with PIMCO's forecasts. PIMCO's house view is that global GDP will rise 2.75% in 2015. The company sees low oil prices holding back inflation, but also sees inflation bouncing back in late 2015 and early 2016. Among other things, PIMCO is bullish on the dollar, but bearish on interest rates. Read the whole note at PIMCO.com. PIMCOPIMCO's house view.      FREE AppDownload

With oil prices on a very bumpy ride over the last few weeks, countries like Russia and Nigeria that depend on oil exports are hurting. RBC Capital Markets just circulated a research note discussing how the recent drop in oil prices could affect various oil producing countries. Included in the note is this chart showing the crude oil market share for each oil exporting country. Saudi Arabia and Russia are by far the two biggest exporters in the world, together responsible for almost 30% of the crude export market. RBC FREE AppDownload
Mikhail Klimentyev/APVladimir Lisin, chairman of Novoliptesk Steel.Russia's wealthiest are getting demolished this year. Over the course of the year, the 20 richest Russians have lost a combined $62 billion, according to Bloomberg. (For a reference point, that's three times the GDP of Afghanistan.) And while 2014 certainly hasn't been easy for Russian billionaires, the last week has been straight-up brutal: The 20 richest lost a whopping $10 billion in just three days. The major drop over the last three days is due to several factors. On early Tuesday morning (late Monday Eastern time), the Russian central bank raised rates from 10.5% to 17%, in order to limit the devaluation of the ruble and the risk of inflation. In a sentence, it did not work. The Russian currency fell to new lows, reaching 80 rubles to the dollar and 100 rubles to the euro that day. Although the ruble has recovered a bit, it dangled around 63 on Thursday. Since the end of June, the ruble has dropped 50%.  BloombergRuble to US dollar in 2014. The biggest loser in dollar value is the CEO of Russia's second-largest gas producer, Leonid Mikhelson, who has lost $8.7 billion since January — twice the GDP of Sierra Leone. The cofounder of a commodity-trading company, Gennady Timchenko, and steel magnate Vladimir Lisin lost $7.8 and $7.5 billion, respectively — roughly the GDP of Rwanda. And percentage-wise, Vladimir Evtushenko was hit the worst. Formerly Russia's 14th-richest person, Evtushenko watched 90% of this wealth evaporate over the year. To make things worse, he was placed under house arrest by a Moscow court back in October. "A chill went through everybody's spine when [Putin] arrested him," Rob Lafranco said on Bloomberg TV early Thursday. Evtushenko was officially released on Wednesday — just one day before Putin's annual press conference, which was seen as a "message that the state will not target business owners as the economy threatens to collapse," according to Bloomberg. "The optimists who thought in March that everything would be all right in the end now understand that nothing will be OK," Stanislav Belovsky, a Kremlin adviser during Putin's first term, told Bloomberg. "Russia's richest take this situation very negatively," he added, "but they do not have the tools to reverse it." You can watch the full Bloomberg interview here.  FREE AppDownload
 There's a growing disturbing trend on Wall Street. More leveraged loan buyers are increasingly "blacklisting" investors they don't like and preventing them from investing in their loans, Bloomberg's Nabila Ahmed and Kristen Haunss reported. And according to Ahmed and Haunss, it's not just the little guys who are making the blacklist. Hedge fund giants Fortress Investment Group, Highland Capital Management, and Cerberus Capital were all blocked from investing in RBS Holding Company's $155 million Quadriga Art loan last year. Companies tend to blacklist investors who are known to be tough on debt restructuring, affiliated with a competitor, or, simply, on the company's bad side, they reported. This phenomenon, which seems to have took off back in the 1990s, is surprisingly widespread.  Some 77% of loans made last quarter allowed borrowers to block specific investors, while last year, the number was only 51%, the reporter said. Blacklisting can be a problem because it cuts down on potential buyers, meaning the loans can become difficult to trade. Read the whole story at Bloomberg.com.   FREE AppDownload
Amazon You're probably wondering why on earth you need this specific blender — the Vitamix S30 — when you can just get any old blender at your local superstore. Well, tl;dr — it's really the best. For starters, you can make pretty much anything in the S30 — so that saves you the hassle of having to get multiple devices for making different things. (Not to mention the money.) The beauty of the S30 is that it comes with two containers: a 20 oz. and a 40 oz. option — depending on what you need that day. With the smaller container, you'll be able to make yourself a quick blended kale-slash-fruit juice (or smoothie, or shake, or whatever you're feeling for a quick meal) and immediately flip it and take it to go. A total time saver, and it makes just enough for one person. On the flip side, with the 40 oz. option you'll be able to make something a bit more substantial, and for multiple people. Think — garlicky tomato sauces for pastas or butternut squash soups in the winter. All you need to do is swap out the top. Another great element about the Vitamix is that it cleans itself (yeah, you read that correctly). Although that's not something most people consider when they're picking out a blender, it's certainly something that comes to mind when you're finagling with a janky blender's blades, trying to clean out the remains of your soup. Think ahead, here. From the engineering perspective, the S30 comes with an interchangeable blade base that attaches to both containers easily, and a powerful motor that can crush even the toughest substances — even ice cubes. Vitamix users swear by the blender's durability. So instead of having to buy a new blender ever year or so, just one, well-made blender is certainly worth the investment.

Last week we started a series of letters on the topics I think we need to research in depth as we try to peer into the future and think about how 2015 will unfold. In forecasting US growth, I wrote that we really need to understand the relationships between the boom in energy production on the one hand and employment and overall growth in the US on the other. The old saw that falling oil prices are like a tax cut and are thus a net benefit to the US economy and consumers is not altogether clear to me. I certainly hope the net effect will be positive, but hope is not a realistic basis for a forecast. Let’s go back to two paragraphs I wrote last week: Texas has been home to 40% of all new jobs created since June 2009. In 2013, the city of Houston had more housing starts than all of California. Much, though not all, of that growth is due directly to oil. Estimates are that 35–40% of total capital expenditure growth is related to energy. But it’s no secret that not only will energy-related capital expenditures not grow next year, they are likely to drop significantly. The news is full of stories about companies slashing their production budgets. This means lower employment, with all of the knock-on effects. Lacy Hunt and I were talking yesterday about Texas and the oil industry. We have both lived through five periods of boom and bust, although I can only really remember three. This is a movie we’ve seen before, and we know how it ends. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has remarkable timing, slipping out the door to let new governor Greg Abbott to take over just in time to oversee rising unemployment in Texas. The good news for the rest of the country is that in prior Texas recessions the rest of the country has not been dragged down. But energy is not just a Texas and Louisiana story anymore. I will be looking for research as to how much energy development has contributed to growth and employment in the US. Then the research began to trickle in, and over the last few days there has been a flood. As we will see, energy production has been the main driver of growth in the US economy for the last five years. But changing demographics suggest that we might not need the job-creation machine of energy production as much in the future to ensure overall employment growth. When I sat down to begin writing this letter on Friday morning, I really intended to write about how falling commodity prices (nearly across the board) and the rise of the dollar are going to affect emerging markets. The risks of significant policy errors and an escalating currency war are very real and could be quite damaging to global growth. But we will get into that next week. Today we’re going to focus on some fascinating data on the interplay between energy and employment and the implications for growth of the US economy. (Note: this letter will print a little longer due to numerous charts, but the word count is actually shorter than usual.) The Impact of Oil On US Growth I had the pleasure recently of having lunch with longtime Maine fishing buddy Harvey Rosenblum, the long-serving but recently retired chief economist of the Dallas Federal Reserve. Like me, he has lived through multiple oil cycles here in Texas. He really understands the impact of oil on the Texas and US economies. He pointed me to two important sources of data. The first is a research report published earlier this year by the Manhattan Institute, entitled “The Power and Growth Initiative Report.” Let me highlight a few of the key findings: 1. In recent years, America’s oil &amp; gas boom has added $300–$400 billion annually to the economy – without this contribution, GDP growth would have been negative and the nation would have continued to be in recession. 2. America’s hydrocarbon revolution and its associated job creation are almost entirely the result of drilling &amp; production by more than 20,000 small and midsize businesses, not a handful of “Big Oil” companies. In fact, the typical firm in the oil &amp; gas industry employs fewer than 15 people. [We typically don’t think of the oil business as the place where small businesses are created, but for those of us who have been around the oil patch, we all know that it is. That tendency is becoming even more pronounced as the drilling process becomes more complicated and the need for specialists keeps rising. – John] 3. The shale oil &amp; gas revolution has been the nation’s biggest single creator of solid, middle-class jobs – throughout the economy, from construction to services to information technology. 4. Overall, nearly 1 million Americans work directly in the oil &amp; gas industry, and a total of 10 million jobs are associated with that industry. Oil &amp; gas jobs are widely geographically dispersed and have already had a significant impact in more than a dozen states: 16 states have more than 150,000 jobs directly in the oil &amp; gas sector and hundreds of thousands more jobs due to growth in that sector. Author Mark Mills highlighted the importance of oil in employment growth:  The important takeaway is that, without new energy production, post-recession US growth would have looked more like Europe’s – tepid, to say the least. Job growth would have barely budged over the last five years. Further, it is not just a Texas and North Dakota play. The benefits have been widespread throughout the country. “For every person working directly in the oil and gas ecosystem, three are employed in related businesses,” says the report. (I should note that the Manhattan Institute is a conservative think tank, so the report is pro-energy-production; but for our purposes, the important thing is the impact of energy production on recent US economic growth.) The next chart Harvey directed me to was one that’s on the Dallas Federal Reserve website, and it’s fascinating. It shows total payroll employment in each of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. No surprise, Texas (the Dallas Fed district) shows the largest growth (there are around 1.8 million oil-related jobs in Texas, according to the Manhattan Institute). Next largest is the Minneapolis Fed district, which includes North Dakota and the Bakken oil play. Note in the chart below that four districts have not gotten back to where they were in 2007, and another four have seen very little growth even after eight years. “It is no wonder,” said Harvey, “that so many people feel like we’re still in a recession; for where they live, it still is.”  To get the total picture, let’s go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database and look at the same employment numbers – but for the whole country. Notice that we’re up fewer than two million jobs since the beginning of the Great Recession. That’s a growth of fewer than two million jobs in eight years when the population was growing at multiples of that amount.  To put an exclamation point on that, Zero Hedge offers this thought: Houston, we have a problem. With a third of S&amp;P 500 capital expenditure due from the imploding energy sector (and with over 20% of the high-yield market dominated by these names), paying attention to any inflection point in the US oil-producers is critical as they have been gung-ho “unequivocally good” expanders even as oil prices began to fall. So, when Reuters reports a drop of almost 40 percent in new well permits issued across the United States in November, even the Fed's Stan Fischer might start to question [whether] his [belief that] lower oil prices are "a phenomenon that’s making everybody better off" may warrant a rethink. Consider: lower oil prices unequivocally “make everyone better off.” Right? Wrong. First: new oil well permits collapse 40% in November; why is this an issue? Because since December 2007, or roughly the start of the global depression, shale oil states have added 1.36 million jobs while non-shale states have lost 424,000 jobs.  The writer of this Zero Hedge piece, whoever it is (please understand there is no such person as Tyler Durden; the name is simply a pseudonym for several anonymous writers), concludes with a poignant question: So, is [Fed Vice-Chairman] Stan Fischer's “not very worried” remark about to become the new Ben “subprime contained” Bernanke of the last crisis? Did the Fed Cause the Shale Bubble? Next let’s turn to David Stockman (who I think writes even more than I do). He took aim at the Federal Reserve, which he accuses of creating the recent “shale bubble” just as it did the housing bubble, by keeping interest rates too low and forcing investors to reach for yield. There may be a little truth to that. The reality is that the recent energy boom was financed by $500 billion of credit extended to mostly “subprime” oil companies, who issued what are politely termed high-yield bonds – to the point that 20% of the high-yield market is now energy-production-related. Sidebar: this is not quite the same problem as subprime loans were, for two reasons: first, the subprime loans were many times larger in total, and many of them were fraudulently misrepresented. Second, many of those loans were what one could characterize as “covenant light,” which means the borrowers can extend the loan, pay back in kind, or change the terms if they run into financial difficulty. So this energy-related high-yield problem is going to take a lot more time than the subprime crisis did to actually manifest, and there will not be immediate foreclosures. But it already clear that the problem is going to continue to negatively (and perhaps severely) impact the high-yield bond market. Once the problems in energy loans to many small companies become evident, prospective borrowers might start looking at the terms that the rest of the junk-bond market gets, which are just as egregious, so they might not like what they see. We clearly did not learn any lessons in 2005 to 2007 and have repeated the same mistakes in the junk-bond market today. If you lose your money this time, you probably deserve to lose it. The high-yield shake-out, by the way, is going to make it far more difficult to raise money for energy production in the future, when the price of oil will inevitably rise again. The Saudis know exactly what they’re doing. But the current contretemps in the energy world is going to have implications for the rest of the leveraged markets. “Our biggest worry is the end of the liquidity cycle. The Fed is done. The reach for yield that we have seen since 2009 is going into reverse,” says Bank of America (source: The Telegraph). Contained within Stockman’s analysis is some very interesting work on the nature of employment in the post-recession US economy. First, in the nonfarm business sector, the total hours of all persons working is still below that of 2007, even though we nominally have almost two million more jobs. Then David gives us two charts that illustrate the nature of the jobs we are creating (a topic I’ve discussed more than once in this letter). It’s nice to have somebody do the actual work for you. The first chart shows what he calls “breadwinner jobs,” which are those in manufacturing, information technology, and other white-collar work that have an average pay rate of about $45,000 a year. Note that this chart encompasses two economic cycles covering both the Greenspan and Bernanke eras.  So where did the increase in jobs come from? From what Stockman calls the “part-time economy.” If I read this chart right and compare it to our earlier chart from the Federal Reserve, it basically demonstrates (and this conclusion is also borne out by the research I’ve presented in the past) that the increase in the number of jobs is almost entirely due to the creation of part-time and low-wage positions – bartenders, waiters, bellhops, maids, cobblers, retail clerks, fast food workers, and temp help. Although there are some professional bartenders and waiters who do in fact make good money, they are the exception rather than the rule.  It’s no wonder we are working fewer hours even as we have more jobs. Oil in 2015 With all that as a backdrop, let us return to our original task, which was to think about what will impact the US and global economies in 2015. I’ve been talking to friends and contacts who are serious players in the energy-production sector. This is my takeaway. The oil-rig count is already dropping, and it will continue to drop as long as oil stays below $60. That said, however, there is the real possibility that oil production in the United States will actually rise in 2015 because of projects already in the works. If you have already spent (or committed to spend) 30 or 40% of the cost of a well, you’re probably going to go ahead and finish that well. There’s enough work in the pipeline (pardon the pun) that drilling and production are not going to fall off a cliff next quarter. But by the close of 2015 we will see a significant reduction in drilling. Given present supply and demand characteristics, oil in the $40 range is entirely plausible. It may not stay down there for all that long (in the grand scheme of things), but it will reduce the likelihood that loans of the nature and size that were extended the last few years will be made in the future. Which is entirely the purpose of the Saudis’ refusing to reduce their own production. A side benefit to them (and the rest of the world) is that they also hurt Russia and Iran. Employment associated with energy production is going to fall over the course of next year. It’s not all bad news, though. Employment that benefits from lower energy prices is likely to remain stable or even rise. Think chemical companies that use natural gas as an input as an example. I am, however, at a loss to think of what could replace the jobs and GDP growth that the energy complex has recently created. Certainly, reduced production is going to impact capital expenditures. This all leads one to begin thinking about a much softer economy in the US in 2015. What If We Just Need Fewer Jobs? We must balance this problematic analysis against research that Harvey Rosenblum (whom we met at the top of the letter) and my good friend (and likewise Maine fishing buddy) John Silvia, the chief economist at Wells Fargo, have just produced. John is a very solid economist who has his head on straight (in addition to being a really nice guy). John asked the question, “What if we just need fewer jobs?”: Job growth is a function of both the supply of and demand for labor. With labor force participation having fallen sharply since the Great Recession and growth in the working-age population slowing, growth in the supply of labor, measured by labor force growth, looks to have downshifted in recent years. As a result, the number of new jobs needed each month to keep the unemployment rate steady has also declined. We estimate that from 2015 to 2020, payroll growth of around 65,000 jobs per month should be sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor force and to exert neutral pressure on the unemployment rate. This marks a notable downshift from a trend of around 150,000 in the 1980s and 1990s, and even the early 2000s when trend employment growth slowed to around 120,000. Harvey and I talked about this research, and while we are probably going to ask John for the spreadsheets and more details as to his basic assumptions, anyone who studies demography knows that a serious falloff in the number of new babies began some 23 years ago. And while I don’t think that Baby Boomers are going to retire following the same patterns that we saw in previous generations, there will certainly be an increase in those who think of themselves as retired, reducing the participation rate. An immediate takeaway from this analysis is that if job growth continues to bump along in the 200,000 range, it will not be too long before there is wage pressure, especially in skilled jobs. That would be good news for workers. If we couple that pressure with a change in the silly rule that says that anyone working more than 30 hours is considered to be full-time and move the number of hours considered to be full-time work to 40 (I think that has a good possibility of passing next year), it will mean that workers (especially those who are younger) get more hours, more income, and better jobs. It will also mean that the unemployment rate will trend down, even if employment growth is not up to historical standards. And let’s make no mistake, it has not been. Putting today’s rather pathetic job growth in context, George Will writes this week in the National Review: The euphoria occasioned by the economy adding 321,000 jobs in November indicates that we have defined success down. In the 1960s, there were nine months in which more than 300,000 jobs were added, the last being June 1969, when there were about 117 million fewer Americans than there are now. In the 1980s, job growth exceeded 300,000 in 23 months, the last being November 1988, when there were about 75 million fewer Americans than today. To demonstrate how young people “are not getting the kind of start others got,” Camp offers a graph charting the “fraction of young adults living with older family members.” Beginning in the middle of the last decade, the line goes almost straight up, to almost 46 percent. For those 25 to 34, median household income plunged 8.9 percent between June 2009 and June 2012, the first three years of the recovery.” We’re going to stop here before the letter runs too long. Next week we really will get to the global economy and especially the dollar story. We will have to address the very sad question, “Are we really going to have to focus on Greece again?” And while I tend to vigorously disagree with Paul Krugman’s policy analysis and prescriptions, he pretty much gets it right in talking about the problems of Greece in his latest New York Times column “Mad as Hellas.” It is all so very sad. He ends up talking about the rise of protest parties all over Europe. That is something I have addressed in this letter as well, and it is a disconcerting phenomenon. He concludes with the comment: But there’s a reason they’re [protest movements] on the rise. This is what happens when an elite claims the right to rule based on its supposed expertise, its understanding of what must be done – then demonstrates both that it does not, in fact, know what it is doing, and that it is too ideologically rigid to learn from its mistakes. And I totally agree with that statement. I think that’s precisely the lesson we should learn from the 2014 US elections, as well. The irony is that many of us would consider Paul Krugman to be part of that elite. Just saying.

I see Cincinnati, Grand Cayman, and Florida on my schedule. It has been a while since I’ve been in the Cayman Islands, and this time I will take a short hop over to Little Cayman to visit my friend Raoul Pal for a few days.

He is also a partner with Grant Williams in Real Vision Television, a fascinating new take on internet investment TV. I’ll be writing more about it in the future. On a very personal note, everyone is aware of the “We Can’t Breathe” protests that are taking place in response to a very tragic incident in New York. Reasonable people can disagree on what the response should be or on how to interpret the facts of that particular incident, but it is not difficult for me to understand the frustrations of the African-American community. I have two adopted black sons (now adults) along with my five other children (two of them Asian-American). I can tell you that my experience has been that as teenagers they were far more likely to be pulled over and harassed or arrested for things my white children would have been simply told to stop doing and then sent on their way. For the police it seemed to be a problem for my black sons to drive my car around my (admittedly mostly white) neighborhood. There were clearly double standards, both in some of the public and private schools my children attended. I had to be careful not to put them in certain situations that would cause them frustrations. To pretend there is still not a double standard in our society is to whistle past the graveyard. That said, I don’t want to seem like I’m giving a pass to what is clearly all too often a broken family structure and cultural acceptance of certain inappropriate behaviors among young black men. The frustrations of all parties stem from very real problems. There are no simple answers, and much of the really hard work needs to be done in local communities. The whole racial issue has vastly improved since I was young. Projections are that by 2020 around 10% of people in the US will be biracial. That is expected to grow to 20% by 2050 and is clearly going to change the way that we (and especially our children) interact with each other. I will have my fifth biracial grandchild sometime later this month. I hope the world they grow up in is considerably different from the world I grew up in or even today’s world. But recent events demonstrate that we still have some miles left on the journey to a truly colorblind system. Rather than defending a system that clearly still has issues that need to be dealt with, we need to face the problems and figure out how to make a world we want all of our children to grow up in. And on that note, it’s time to hit the send button. Have a great week.

Vimeo, ScreenshotRobbie Austin's bar-mitzvah video was a hit. And Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and New York Knicks star player Carmelo Anthony helped young New Yorker Robbie Austin absolutely crush the video game. It came together like this: Robbie got cut from the basketball team, so in an effort to compensate for that bruising, his dad, entrepreneur Ken Austin, decided to call some friends to kick Robbie's bar-mitzvah video up a notch. “I reached out to Mark Cuban and Carmelo Anthony ... and they both agreed right away to help me out, simply from the kindness of their hearts," Austin told Business Insider. "Mark even got on a plane and came to New York to help shoot the video with my son. Overall, it was a great lesson that no matter how busy, famous or 'rich' someone is, making time for others and having humility can really go a long way. I was so appreciative of their generosity and it softened the sting a bit of having to watch your son cut from a team.” As for Robbie, obviously he was super pumped. He wants to show the video to his kids one day, and now people know him as that kid who had Mark and 'Melo in his bar-mitzvah video. "I guess this might be one of the only times it doesn’t completely suck to be cut from the team. It’s sort of funny now … it wasn’t then," Robbie said. Check it out below. For a bar-mitzvah entrance video made on Final Cut Pro, it ain't half bad.  FREE AppDownload
Wall Street's top stock market strategists have been publishing their predictions for 2015. While every strategist expects to see gains next year, most think those gains will be modest. However, Fundstrat's Tom Lee thinks that's a mistake. "Be contrarian," Lee wrote in a new note to clients. He sees the S&amp;P rallying 15% to around 2,325 by the end of 2015. "We realize that the skeptics are rolling their eyes, believing that everyone is too bullish. But take a look at the history of the Street in forecasting S&amp;P 500 actual returns. For 5 of the last 6 years, the Street has underestimated the market close, with the exception being 2011 (when the budget showdown and S&amp;P downgrade hurt equities)." According to the data, Wall Street strategists have underestimated where the S&amp;P would go by around 5% on average. "If 2015’s forecast error is 5% again, the S&amp;P 500 would close at 2325 or higher," Lee wrote. Of course, that's a big "if." Fundstrat Global Advisors FREE AppDownload
Tesla's stock price of late would have reminded Mark Twain of the the weather in New England: If you don't like where Tesla is priced, wait a day, it'll change. After falling below $200 this week for the first time in months, Tesla shares are surging upward almost 4% in trading on Thursday. The stock is currently at $213. Tesla has taken investors on quite a ride this year. Shares hit a trading peak of $291 in September. Then they plunged. Then they recovered in October after the company announced an all-wheel-drive version of its Model S sedans — the "D." But Morgan Stanley lead auto analyst Adam Jonas has expressed skepticism about CEO Elon Musk's ultimate goal of manufacturing 500,000 cars by 2020. And the company recently announced that deliveries of its new Model X SUV will delayed until late 2015. Over the past three months, however, the stock is down almost 20%.  Of course, since the 2010 IPO, the stock is up over 1,000%. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

Glen Wallace, FlickrIt's been a rough year for British supermarket Tesco.  In September, the company had to restate its profits after realising that it overestimated them by more than £250 million over a series of years. Shortly after, Tesco chairman Richard Broadbent quit. And just last week, the firm had to issue another profit warning, while S&amp;P suggested that the firm's credit rating might be cut to junk levels. But on Thursday, JPMorgan released a damaging note that shows things are even worse at the world's second-largest retailer than originally thought.  In short: Tesco's net rental costs have exploded from £158 million in 2006-7 to £989 million in 2013-14. That's a 525% jump! The costs come off the back of more city-centre Tesco Express stores and surging operating leases for the rest of the business. In its better years, the company sold a lot of its property and arranged to rent it back from the new owners so it could finance its international expansion. That expansion is basically over, but Tesco is still paying the rent. Effectively, the supermarket has taken on a debt but that doesn't show up on its balance sheet, because rent doesn't officially count as a liability. That doesn't stop them from being a growing headache for the company. JP Morgan, Tesco AccountsTesco's rental costs have exploded over the last 8 years. But it gets worse: £174 million in earnings is still unaccounted for. That number stems from a estimated gap of £319 million between earnings published by Tesco UK Group and those published by individual parts of the group, like Tesco Property, Tesco Stores, and Tesco Distribution. That gap ran to £69 million in 2008, but that's the largest it has ever been — before now.  It was £3 million last year. A difference of £145 million is explained by the admitted profit overstatement that crashed Tesco's share price in October. That overstatement ran to £263 million in total, but the rest happened in the current (2014-15) financial year. Blinkbox is the only Tesco subsidiary yet to report its results, and it's expected to post a loss and make the gap even wider. Here's the breakdown: JP Morgan Cazenove That's really just the start of Tesco's problems. JP Morgan doesn't really see an upside for the company's whopping size: It is often argued that Tesco is a Buy because ‘it has to be a long term winner due to its scale advantage’. However, we believe that scale alone does not guarantee success; it is the effective use of it for the benefit of the customer that supports success. The world of retail is full of large companies that have failed. Execution and skills are the factors that lead to success much more than scale, in our view. But in any case, the benefit of scale has already been enjoyed by Tesco (it is in the numbers), it is not an incremental benefit. In fact, we can conclude that scale has become an incremental headwind for Tesco as the benefits of scale unwind. After years squeezing suppliers very effectively through volume rebates, as sales fall, these rebates unwind, becoming a headwind. Those "volume rebates" are the payments Tesco and the UK's other major retailers have been reaping from major suppliers for selling large numbers of their products, and promoting them in prominent position. That's fine while you're top dog. As cost-cutters like Aldi and Lidl grow and grow, suppliers are unlikely to be so deferential to Tesco. In short, the UK's biggest retailer's rental costs are surging, it still may not be through the worst of its embarrassing profit restatements, and there's no sunlight on the horizon. As Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets put it in a pithy research note: "Every little hurts".  FREE AppDownload
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Work crews are scrambling underneath New York City to finish the city's first major new subway stop in 25 years, a fast-track project intended to revitalize a long-neglected slice of Manhattan. The city's transit authority has been working for seven years on the $2.4 billion extension of the Number 7 subway line, once known mainly for transporting fans to New York Mets baseball games and the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Now the line will extend far west to 11th Avenue in Manhattan, a run-down neighborhood long known as Hell's Kitchen that is home to a major bus station and tunnel entrances to New Jersey. Like most big infrastructure projects in U.S. cities, the extension has suffered some delays, but it has moved along far faster than a Second Avenue subway that is still under construction after more than 80 years of planning. The project was sped along by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who came up with a novel financing structure that allowed the project to avoid the time-consuming process of seeking federal funding but has drawn some critics who contend it leaves local taxpayers on the hook for decades. Problems with a fire alarm and security system have pushed completion until April 2015, said Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which runs the city's subways, buses and some commuter rail. Previous delays were blamed on mechanical failures of two inclined elevators to carry passengers to street level. "It's a very, very important subway extension. It's going to be huge," said Kenneth T. Jackson, who teaches history and social sciences at Columbia University and editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City.Megan Willett/Business Insider and Copyright Related/Oxford The new station is intended to be the linchpin of the Hudson Yards development, with more than a dozen skyscrapers, a cultural center and parks replacing a neighborhood once dominated by rundown industrial buildings. Key to the project's success is its route, through the city's busiest transit hubs of Grand Central and Times Square, opening up the far west side to the entire mass transit system, said Mitchell Moss, professor of urban planning at New York University. It will also serve as an entry point to the popular High Line elevated park. The Hudson Yards station is expected to see 200,000 daily riders by 2025, according to MTA projections, on a system that sees 5.8 million riders each day. By way of comparison, the busiest station, Times Square, today sees 197,696 daily riders. The speed comes at a cost to the city. Bloomberg pushed through an innovative financing scheme that leap-frogged federal rules that can slow the development of transit projects, but means it has no financial support from Washington. "The only way this was done is that the City of New York had the vision and took the initiative to finance it rather than to wait for the U.S. Department of Transportation processes, which would mean a terminal death," NYU's Moss said. Critics said bypassing those federal hurdles also meant missing federal aid. The city's offer of steep property tax breaks to Hudson Yards real estate developers left a greater burden for taxpayers, they said. Megan Willett/Business Insider and Copyright Related/Oxford"For city taxpayers, it's a horrendous deal," said James Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a non-profit research organization that opposed the financing plan. "It's costing city taxpayers money now, and will cost them for the next two or three decades." Charles Brecher of the Citizens Budget Commission, a civic organization that has not taken a stand on the financing, said it will be long time before the Hudson Yards buildings are valuable enough to pay off the city-backed bonds. "In the short run, the city has had to subsidize it," said Brecher, CBC's consulting director of research. To extend the line, the MTA bored a 1.5 mile (2.4 kilometer) tunnel from West 26th Street and 11th Avenue to Times Square, said Michael Horodniceanu, the MTA's head of capital construction. The station itself will occupy a 1,212-foot (369 meter) cavern. "If you take the Empire State Building and put it on its side, it would probably fill that," Horodniceanu said. The new station could transform its neighborhood by drawing in new residents and businesses in the way a decision a century ago to bury a surface rail line that left a sooty trail north from Grand Central Terminal changed that stretch of Manhattan, observers said. That street, Park Avenue, is now synonymous with luxury. "This is the equivalent," NYU's Moss said. "We're taking an area that people avoided, and making it an area that people want to go to."

Six Flags Over Texas/Facebook Near 1:00 pm ET on Thursday, the Dow was up 303 points, the S&amp;P 500 was up 34 points, and the Nasdaq was up 80 points. The rally in stocks comes after the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday had its best day of the year. That came after the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement, which saw the Fed say it would be "patient" in raising interest rates. Earlier Thursday, we got initial jobless claims data that beat expectations. Initial jobless claims fell to 289,000 from last week's 295,000, which was expected by economists.  Also Thursday, we got the flash reading on service sector activity from Markit Economics, which fell to 53.6 from 56.2 in November. Any reading over 50 indicates growth, though Thursday's number suggests the slowest rate of service sector expansion since October 2013. The latest manufacturing reading from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve came in at 24.5, below expectations and well off November's blowout 40.8 reading, which was a 21-year high. Stocks have had a rocky December, though many expected stocks to rally into the end of the year as part of the so-called "Santa Claus Rally." And so maybe Santa is here now.   FREE AppDownload

MarkitThe US services sector is growing at a nice pace, but it slowed a bit in December. Markit's flash US services PMI fell to 53.6, down from 56.2 in November. This was weaker than the 56.3 expected by economists. It's worth noting that any reading above 50 signals growth. "A sharp slowing in service sector activity alongside a similar easing in the manufacturing sector takes the overall rate of economic expansion down to the weakest since October 2013," Markit's Chris Williamson said. "The extent of the slowdown suggests that economic growth in the fourth quarter could come in below 2% which, with the exception of the downturn caused by adverse weather in the first quarter, would be the worst performance for two years." Here's more from Williamson: “The slowdown is linked to weaker growth of new business as customers becoming increasingly worried about the economic outlook both at home and abroad, with the prospect of higher interest rates cooling demand alongside side rising global geopolitical concerns. Across both manufacturing and services, new business grew in December at a pace well below the rates of expansion seen earlier in the year. “Job creation has also slowed sharply alongside the cooling of demand, and payroll numbers across both sectors showed the smallest rise for eight months. Another bumper month of non-farm payroll growth looks unlikely in December, with private sector payroll growth unlikely to breach the 200,000 mark.” Read the whole report at MarkitEconomics.com.

REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve made its final policy announcement of the year.  In a note to clients following the Fed meeting, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hans Mikkelsen has a simple breakdown of the seven things we know after Wednesday's big meeting: There were no major surprises on Wednesday, but the biggest change is that the Fed dropped the phrase "considerable time" in favor of "patient." Here's the key passage: "Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy." This change had the market a bit confused, given that the following sentence said: "The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October." So, the Fed's statement contained the words "considerable time," but used them only as a point of comparison: this is what our guidance is ("patient") versus what it used to be ("considerable time").  Additionally, the Fed said these are equivalent. And so all things considered, not the easiest message to parse. FREE AppDownload

Wikimedia CommonsCarnegie Library on Cheyney University (Pa.) Campus quad, built in 1909.The nation's oldest black college, Cheyney University, one of Pennsylvania's 14 state-run universities, is on the verge of a financial meltdown that threatens its ability to continue operating, a state official said Wednesday. Cheyney's student body has shrunk by two-thirds, to about 1,000, since its 1983 peak, and its four-year graduation rate is just 9%. A quarter of students never receive a degree, and student-loan defaults are high. "Cheyney is in dire, dire, dire straits," the state's auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, said. The university has had a deficit for four of the past five years, growing to a cumulative $12.3 million shortfall as of June 30, 2013. Cheyney's fiscal problems — students who are unable to repay debt and increasing pension costs — were exacerbated by cutbacks in state higher education funding. DePasquale called upon the State System of Higher Education — the governing body for the state-owned universities — and the legislature to help Cheyney find a way out of "a vicious, destructive cycle" in which declining enrollment and state funding leads to less money for investments that could attract much-needed students. Cheyney, located in the Philadelphia suburb of the same name, was founded in 1837 after Quaker philanthropist Richard Humphreys bequeathed part of his estate to build a school to educate descendants of the African race, according to the university's website. Its alumni include journalist Ed Bradley, state and US elected officials, several National Football League players, a US ambassador to South Africa, and Robert Bogle, chief executive of The Philadelphia Tribune. Cheyney officials did not respond to requests for comment. The university has begun to shrink its workforce by 23% and to cut offices' discretionary spending in half, DePasquale's audit said. School officials are planning more aggressive recruitment and will try to improve student retention and graduation rates. They hope to present a new policy to be implemented in January, the audit said. Across the country, states have cut higher education spending, especially as they struggled to recover from the 2007-2009 recession. From fiscal 2003 through 2012, state funding fell by 12%, while median tuition rose 55% across all public colleges, the US Government Accountability Office said in a report published Tuesday. Cheyney is just six miles from Pennsylvania's largest and best-off state system university, West Chester University, which has nearly 16,000 students. Tuition and fees at the two schools are roughly the same.   (Reporting by David DeKok in Harrisburg, Penn.; Editing by Hilary Russ and Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload

TBINew jobless claims are down. Initial unemployment-insurance claims fell to 289,000 this week, from 295,000 a week ago. This was lower than the 295,000 forecast by economists. The four-week average has declined to 298,750 from 299,500 a week ago. "The underlying trend in claims, we believe, is still 285-to-290K, low enough to signal very strong payroll growth, assuming indicators of the hiring side of the payroll equation remain strong," Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said. Continuing claims fell to 2.373 million from 2.520 million a week ago. "The four-week moving average of initial claims has been below the 300k threshold for over three months, a sign that involuntary separations are at their nadir," Nomura economists said ahead of the report.

Dr. Ed's BlogWe now have November data compiled by Oil Market Intelligence on global oil demand and supply. The data show that world crude oil revenues and outlays, at an annual rate, plunged by $1.1 trillion from June through November, down to $2.7 trillion. OPEC’s revenues are down at an annualized $409 billion over this period. Global oil demand growth continued to slow. While the 12-month average rose to a record high of 92.8mbd during November, it was up just 0.7% y/y, the lowest since April 2012. The weakness is mostly attributable to the advanced economies of the OECD, where oil demand is down 0.8% y/y, while emerging economies’ demand is up 2.2%. The big story, of course, is the surge in non-OPEC production in recent months. It jumped 2.8mbd over the past six months through November. It is up 4.4% y/y. That’s forced OPEC to reduce output slightly last month. US and Canadian output rose 1.1mbd over the past six months through November. I expect that the plunge in oil prices will reduce global production quickly within the next few months, especially in countries with relatively high production costs. We predict that the price of a barrel of Brent will stabilize between $60 and $70 next year. Dr. Ed's BlogToday's Morning Briefing: Grand Central 24/7. (1) Fairy Godmother.

"Be contrarian," Tom Lee says. "Investors are expecting 2015 to be a low-return year and are focusing on deflation and Fed tightening." Lee, the former chief US equity strategist for JPMorgan and current head of Fundstrat Global Advisors, expects the S&amp;P 500 to hit 2,325 by the end of 2015. That would represent a massive 15% gain from Wednesday's closing price. "[T]he current bull market is not going to end simply because 'stocks have gone up too much,'" Lee writes in a note to clients. Since its March 2009 low, the S&amp;P 500 has surged by over 200%. "The buyside is fairly cautious, seeing downside stemming from: (i) deflationary pressures of the 40% year-over-year oil decline, deceleration in China, Eurozone weakness, and the fall in 5-year inflation breakevens; and (ii) Fed monetary tightening," Lee says. Among other things, Lee continues to see returns fueled by growth in investment spending as equipment and structures continue to wear out. "Capital stock is again showing signs of pent-up demand, and as a consequence, companies and households will have to invest," he writes. "In other words, obsolescence is playing a role here. Equipment needs to be replaced as it reaches the end of its useful life." Lee, however, is mindful of the possibility that things might not work out as he sees it. "What could go wrong?" he asks. "The biggest risk is spreading contagion from the weakness in oil to credit markets and sovereign debt. We think these concerns are exaggerated, and this is reflected by the fact that US High Yield and US Investment Grade trades wider than Euro High Yield and Euro Investment Grade." All of this fits into Lee's longer-term call that we are in the midst of a secular bull market. Lee entered 2014 as the most bullish strategist on Wall Street with his forecast that the S&amp;P 500 would hit 2,075 by year-end. The S&amp;P cleared that hurdle on Dec. 4.

From a Western perspective, Vladimir Putin's days as president of Russia should be numbered: The ruble has lost more than half its value, the economy is in crisis and his aggression in Ukraine has turned the country into an international pariah. And yet most Russians see Putin not as the cause, but as the solution. The situation as seen from a Russian point of view is starkly different from that painted in the West, and it is driven largely by state television's carefully constructed version of reality and the Kremlin's methodical dismantling of every credible political alternative. As Putin prepares to face his public in a much-anticipated televised news conference, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Thursday found that about 80 percent of Russians still support him. But it also showed that confidence in the economy is slipping. This is particularly true in Moscow, where people have become accustomed to imported goods and foreign travel, now once again off-limits for many because of the fall of the ruble and Western sanctions over Ukraine. The poll was conducted between Nov. 22 and Dec. 7, when the ruble was steadily declining. But this week's catastrophic collapse is likely to have a much greater effect on consumer prices and the standard of living. For Putin, the question is whether he will be able to convince Russians to tighten their belts, and not just for a few months but possibly for years to come. "The Russian people have a sense that they are under sanctions, they are a fortress under siege," said Maria Lipman, an independent analyst. "This kind of mentality is disseminated consistently and steadily by Russian television: Who else is there to rely on except Putin? Putin is seen as the savior of the nation, and I think he sees himself in this fashion." Putin will address his countrymen's concerns over the course of three or four hours at Thursday's news conference. He seems all but certain to send the message that he is in charge and all is fine. An advertisement for the news conference running on state television shows Putin surrounded by Sochi Olympic athletes, petting a baby tiger and greeting cosmonauts. "We are absolutely capable of doing everything ourselves," he promises the audience. How Russians view Putin is associated with how they get their news, the poll showed. Those who identified state television as their main source of news are more likely to approve of Putin (84 percent) than those who have other sources (73 percent), while those who tune into the news often also have a more favorable opinion of him. REUTERS/Alexei NikolskyiRussia's President Vladimir Putin visits a Rosneft refinery in the Black Sea town of Tuapse in southern Russia October 11, 2013.After becoming president in 2000, Putin benefited from high prices for oil, the mainstay of Russia's economy. In the past decade, Russians saw their living standards rise faster than at any other point in modern history, transforming many average citizens into car owners and globe-trotters for the first time ever.The suppression of opposition politicians and independent media, widely criticized by outside observers, was tacitly accepted by many as a compromise worth making for economic stability after the roller coaster years of the 1990s. "I very much support Putin — who else is there to support?" said Valentina Roshupkina, a 79-year-old resident of Gryaz, a town several hours' drive south of Moscow. "The country is moving in the right direction, I believe, because he lifted up the army, he made the government stronger. People started to be a little bit afraid of us." Poll respondents were asked whether they would be willing to speak with an AP reporter, and Roshupkina was among the many who agreed.With the Russian economy buffeted by Western sanctions and the fall in oil prices, Putin has relied even more on his image as a tough leader capable of standing up to the West. He appears to be betting that this will help him weather the economic storm. So far he's been right: The presidency and the military are the country's most trusted institutions, according to the poll, with three out of four Russians saying they trust the presidency and two out of three expressing faith in the military. "We've revived the army and that's very important," said Ivan Savenko, a 50-year-old driver in the southern city of Stavropol who also took part in the poll. "For us, the most important thing is the army and then everything else. It's important for us that our country is a power. If we are not a power, we do not exist." Of those surveyed, 81 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of the way Putin is handling his job, a dramatic increase of more than 20 percentage points from an AP-GfK poll conducted in 2012. Alexander Demianchuk/ReutersA navy sailor looks on near a board showing currency exchange rates in St. Petersburg, October 30, 2014. The rouble jumped on Thursday, bouncing off an all-time low against the dollar amid market talk of possible central bank intervention ahead of a monetary policy meeting and rumours of a deal with Ukraine over Crimea. While Russia has become more authoritarian under Putin, the support for him appears genuine. The significant fluctuation in Putin's ratings in recent years also indicates that Russians feel able to respond freely in anonymous surveys about their views on the president. The 81 percent approval rating is only slightly higher statistically than the 74 percent measured during the same time period by the Levada Center, Russia's most respected independent pollster. Many analysts question, however, whether the high ratings have any significance, given the Kremlin's control over information. "There is a total, effective, monopolistic propaganda campaign, and if there is an information monopoly, how can you talk about ratings?" said Georgy Satarov, a former Kremlin adviser who heads a research institute that studies corruption. "The thing you have to pay attention to is not the fact that 80 percent support him, but that despite that information monopoly 15 percent don't support him," he said. Support for Putin soared after he moved to seize the Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March. "A source of pride for the overwhelming majority of Russians is the victory of World War II, but that was already 70 years ago," Lipman said. "(In Crimea) Putin gave the sense that we are victorious and triumphant and resurgent today." The Russia-backed separatists who took up arms against government troops in eastern Ukraine also have been portrayed as heroes on state television. Of the Russians polled, 69 percent said that many or some parts of Ukraine rightfully belong to Russia. But some, like 37-year-old librarian Yelena Shevilyova, said that although she approves of Putin, she believes Russia's involvement in Ukraine may have come at too high a cost. "I think we lost a lot in our lives because of this," said Shevilyova, another poll participant, referring to Crimea. "I think that it is right to bring all of these (Russian-speaking regions) back, but we need everything to be good here too. ... You can't have everything at once," she said, speaking from the far northern region of Perm. Growing worries about a worsening economy and the impact of sanctions are more keenly felt in major cities. In Moscow, more than 6 in 10 said they had been negatively affected by the sanctions and most said their family's finances were worse than three years ago. Less than half felt that way elsewhere. "I am afraid that Russia isn't going anywhere," said Dmitry Uryupin, 48, a sound director in a small production firm in Moscow who was among those surveyed. "It's unlikely that wages will be raised. In fact, it's quite likely the opposite will happen, unemployment will rise and it will all affect the most economically insecure people as well as us, the creative class." After Putin was inaugurated for a third term in 2012 after a wave of protests in Moscow driven by the creative class, he clamped down even harder on the opposition and focused on his core electorate: people in the provinces and those more dependent on the state for their income. The disgruntled in Moscow have proved easy to discredit in the eyes of what is known as the Putin majority: "Look at these poor Muscovites. ... Oh my God, they complain because they cannot go to Italy on vacation and they can no longer afford to buy Parmesan cheese!" Lipman said. Whether discontent not just with the economy but with Putin's leadership will grow, Lipman said, depends on "how badly this will hurt, and for how long." The AP-NORC Center poll of Russia was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with fieldwork for the in-person survey by GfK Russia from Nov. 22-Dec. 7. It is based on 2,008 in-person interviews with a nationally representative random sample of Russians age 18 and older. Funding for the survey came from NORC at the University of Chicago. Results for all adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. ___ Copyright (2014) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Western sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis are likely to last "for a very long time", possibly decades, Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev told Vedomosti newspaper. "When a U.S. law is passed it is very hard to change it afterwards - looks like it will be in place for decades," Ulyukayev said in an interview published on Thursday. Russia's economy is heading for recession, dragged lower by sanctions imposed by the West over Ukraine and weak oil prices, a cornerstone of state revenues. The rouble has lost more than 45 percent against the dollar since the start of the year. Ulyukayev said a lack of structural reform of the economy had partly set Russia up for "the perfect storm". He added that if there were no sanctions, no falling oil prices and if "we had not done some foolish things" which he did not elaborate on, the Russian economy could show annual growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent. He added that sanctions may become tougher next year with the situation on the oil markets worsening further. "The situation is so hard to predict that we cannot be prepared for its changes in the future ... How should we behave then? Write one more stress-scenario in addition to (the oil price at) $60 (per barrel)? Let's do it for $40, $20 and $10," he said ironically.   (Reporting by Katya Golubkova, editing by Elizabeth Piper) FREE AppDownload
© AFP/File Fabrice CoffriniSwitzerland is to introduce a negative interest rate targeting certain deposits to stop the france strengthening furtherGeneva (AFP) - Switzerland's central bank announced Thursday it was introducing negative interest rates to stop the franc getting any stronger, after the Russian ruble crisis sent investors pouring their investments into the safe haven currency. The Swiss National Bank will impose a rate of -0.25 percent on certain bank deposits on January 22, with the aim of pushing the target range of Switzerland's benchmark interest rate into negative territory. "The Swiss franc has been experiencing renewed upward pressure vis-à-vis the euro in the last few days," said Thomas Jordan, chairman of the SNB governing board. "Rapidly mounting uncertainty on the financial markets has substantially increased demand for safe investments. The worsening of the crisis in Russia was a major contributory factor in this development." The ruble crashed to historic lows this week of 80 to the dollar and 100 to the euro, as the energy-export dependent economy was hit by a rout in oil prices. It has prompted Russians to rush to exchange their savings and make a run on stores to dump the devaluing national currency ahead of expected price hikes. With the safe haven Swiss currency in demand, the SNB was forced to take action to protect the country's vital export sector. The negative interest rate will be imposed on so-called sight deposits, funds which can be accessed immediately, but only apply to balances above a certain threshold. The SNB said the aim of the rate change was to take the three-month Libor rate, which Switzerland uses to determine interest rates on mortgages and savings accounts, into negative territory. The target range for Libor -- the name for the franc's three-month London interbank offered rate -- is now between -0.75 percent and 0.25 percent, compared to its previous level of between 0.0 and 0.25 percent. "This measure will lead to a further decline in the interest earned on Swiss-franc investments, making them less attractive, and thereby easing the upward pressure on the Swiss franc," Jordan said. He reiterated the central bank's "utmost determination" to keep to an exchange-rate floor of 1.20 francs to the euro -- a move that effectively imposes a limit on how strong the Swiss currency can get. "Without the minimum exchange rate, price stability in Switzerland would be seriously compromised," Jordan said. He repeated that the SNB was "prepared to purchase foreign currency in unlimited quantities and to take further measures, if required".   - 'Battle of measures' with ECB -   Analysts had been expecting negative rates even before the Russian crisis, because of the increasing risks of deflation in Switzerland and in anticipation of further stimulus measures by the European Central Bank. "What happens from here will depend in part on how the Russian crisis develops," said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist with Capital Economics. But he added: "We have been warning for some time that the commencement of quantitative easing by the ECB would put further upward pressure on the franc and hence force the SNB into more action." With the ECB governing council meeting next on January 22, he said it was likely the SNB would soon have to follow up the rate cut with further currency intervention. Laurent Bakhtiari, market analyst at IG Bank, said the rate cut was the start of a "long-awaited battle of measures" between the SNB and ECB. "The SNB played the first move very well. From now on, the SNB will constantly have to be one step ahead of the ECB if they want to defend the 1.20 minimum rate," he said. Since setting the minimum exchange rate in September 2011, the bank has intervened whenever necessary to protect it by buying up euros. In 2011, it spent 11 billion francs doing so, and another 188 billion francs between May and September 2012, at the height of the eurozone crisis.     FREE AppDownload

The ruble slipped again Thursday as President Vladimir Putin told reporters during his annual news conference that the currency's falls were "not a crisis." "I would not call the situation a crisis; you may call it whatever you want," Putin told reporters. Currency markets, however, appear yet to be convinced, with another round of volatile trading in the ruble, which briefly breached 63 rubles to the dollar again before falling back. BloombergThe dollar vs the ruble. The ruble was highly volatile Thursday, gaining over 2% in early trading before swinging to a 3% fall on the day. At the time of writing it was 0.5% up against the dollar as Putin attempted to reassure people over the prospects for the Russian economy, which is widely expected to fall into a recession next year predominantly because of collapsing oil prices and western economic sanctions over the country's role in the ongoing Ukraine crisis. Russia's currency has fallen over 45% against the dollar and the euro since June, hitting a record low of 80 rubles to the dollar and 100 roubles to the euro earlier this week. The falls have tracked the collapse of crude oil prices, which have also tumbled from their June highs. The chart below shows the performance of the ruble against the dollar (orange line) versus Brent crude prices (green line): BloombergThe Ruble/dollar (orange) versus Brent crude (green). Putin praised the actions of both the government and the central bank in their attempts to mitigate the impact of the currency falls on the nation's economy. However, the Russian central bank forecasts that if oil prices remain around $60 a barrel next year, the economy will contract by about 4% — a severe recession. Despite the sharp recent falls, Putin again ruled out imposing capital controls (whereby limits would be imposed on cash withdrawals and businesses could be forced to sell foreign currency reserves). He said there were "no plans" to force exporters to sell their currency earnings. However, the central bank did announce emergency measures to defend Russia's beleaguered banking sector from further ruble weakness on Wednesday. These include allowing Russian companies not to mark their assets to market (a measure that will prevent them from having to raise additional funds to cover potential losses), allow companies to use exchange rates from the previous quarter when assessing how much capital they need to cover their liabilities and increase the number of currency auctions (whereby the central bank provides dollars and euros in exchange for collateral) it carries out.

REUTERS/Maxim ZmeyevPutin compared the invasion of Crimea to the US taking Texas from Mexico. The interview — which had a bunch of bizarre and clever moments — also addressed Russia's conflicts with the West. Several English-speaking journalists, including Max Seddon of BuzzFeed and Paul Sonne of The Wall Street Journal, tweeted translations of Putin's statements, and NBC News carried a live stream with translation. Here are some highlights: The ruble weakened against the dollar just ahead of the news conference. Russia's currency has fallen over 40% against the dollar and the euro since June, hitting a record low of 80 rubles to the dollar and 100 rubles to the euro earlier this week. Early on, Putin commented on Russia's currency crisis. He said it had been "provoked by external factors" and that the central bank and government were taking adequate measures to deal with the economic situation. He also insisted that growth is "inevitable" and that Russia could dig out of the crisis in two years at most. Putin said he is optimistic because he thinks the economy will eventually adjust to low fuel prices. He also said that Russia must step up efforts to diversify its economy so that Russia is not so reliant on oil. Before discussing the ruble crisis, Putin opened on a higher note, citing 2014 gross-domestic-product growth of 0.6% and noting that Russia saw a record agricultural harvest despite turbulence in financial markets. He later shied away from calling the ruble collapse a crisis. "I don't think I can call the situation a 'crisis'; you can call it whatever you want," he said, adding that he thinks the central bank and government are taking the correct approach. He also blamed Russia's economic situation partly on sanctions by the West over Ukraine, saying the sanctions are responsible for 25% to 30% of the ruble's problems. Russia's economy is widely expected to fall into a recession next year because of collapsing oil prices and economic sanctions by the West. Putin noted that the country's central bank has reserves of $419 billion, which he said is enough to maintain the "social situation" in Russia. He was also careful to say Russia would not drain its reserves trying to protect the ruble. Despite the country's economic troubles, Russians still widely support Putin. His approval rating hit record highs this year, with 80% of Russians saying they support him. REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev Putin also addressed tensions with the West. "Our Western partners decided that they won and that they are an empire, and they began to squeeze everyone else out," he said. He also referenced the Berlin Wall, saying that new "virtual" walls were being built through a NATO expansion. "We want our partners to understand that the best way is to stop building those walls and to build a united humanitarian space," Putin said. Putin later implied that the West is trying to disarm Russia. He compared the country to a bear and said the West would "always try to put it in chains and ... take out its teeth and claws, which in this case means our strategic nuclear deterrent. "Sometimes I think, maybe they'll let the bear eat berries and honey in the forest; maybe they will leave it in peace," he added. "They will not." Putin concluded by asking: "Do we want our bear to just become a stuffed animal?" When a journalist asked Putin about talk of a "new Cold War" brewing, Putin said that Russia had just been defending its interests, and he implied that the US was the aggressive party, not Russia. He insisted that Russia was not attacking anyone. He then said the sanctions that had been imposed on Russia were "illegitimate and illegal." Ukraine Defense Ministry A Ukrainian journalist asked Putin how many soldiers Putin sent to Ukraine and what he told the families of dead soldiers. Putin said Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine were volunteers and couldn't be called mercenaries because they were not paid. He also blamed Kiev for starting the conflict. "The problem is that after the coup d’etat ... instead of starting a political dialogue, the new authorities started using law enforcement officers," Putin said. "When that didn’t work out, they started using the army; when that didn’t work out, they started using other means, such as an economic blockade." Putin also said that regarding Ukraine, Russia was right and the West was wrong. He didn't address how many Russian fighters were in Ukraine, nor did he give a death toll from the conflict. Estimates put the number of dead at about 4,000 since fighting broke out between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels in April. Kiev, Ukraine's capital, says Russia is supporting the separatists and has 10,000 troops on the ground. REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev  Another journalist asked whether Russia's economic crisis was payback for the country's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Putin said the troubles with the ruble were not payback for Crimea, but rather "payback for our natural desire to survive as a nation." "It's not a matter of Crimea — we are defending our independence, our sovereignty and our right to exist," he said. "We should all understand this." Putin also compared the invasion of Crimea to the US taking Texas from Mexico, saying Russia was just managing its territories and protecting its sovereignty.

Putin was asked whether he regretted pardoning Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man and owner of the country's biggest oil company, because Khodorkovsky recently said he wanted to be president. To that Putin replied, "President of which country?" Putin said he ordered the pardon because Khodorkovsky's mother was ill, and a mother is a "sacred thing." He added that he didn't regret it.  Khodorkovsky spent a decade in prison for fraud and was released last year.

Putin said China is Russia's biggest trade partner and that there were no problems between the two countries. He said the two have many common interests and have helped stabilize the international arena. Putin added that Russia would seek to increase trade with China and noted that their trade balance with China would reach $90 billion this year. He said Russia's gas deal with China would be beneficial for both sides despite the high costs. Russia brokered the deal in an effort to become more independent from the West, given the sanctions that have hindered Russia's ability to develop energy reserves and raise finance abroad, Reuters reports.

A Reuters reporter asked Putin whether he thought a coup was possible in Russia. Putin said he isn't worried, and that he would not be ousted, because Russians knew that he acted in the "overwhelming interest" of the majority of the population. He noted that the Kremlin is well protected: "We don't have palaces, so there can't be any palace coups. We have the Kremlin, and it's well secured." The reporter said that although Putin blamed the economic crisis on external forces, even those within his circle were known to blame Putin. Putin, grinning, said: "Give me their names!" Putin insisted that there are not elites in Russia, and that while there are rich and poor, all people are equal. "There is elite wine, resorts, but not people," he said. "Who is the Russian elite? The peasants, the hard workers." Russia has notoriously high wealth disparity. A report from Credit Suisse in 2013 said that Russia has the highest rate of income inequality in the world.

"As long as we do not reach this goal ... sanctions remain unavoidable, though I would like to reiterate that they were not and are not an end in themselves " she told German parliament.   (Reporting by Stephen Brown and Michelle Martin) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Maxim ShipenkovFor many Russians, the door may be closing on London's high-end property market. Sanctions, bank limitations on withdrawals, and the shattered ruble are killing Russian demand for luxury London housing. All but the wealthiest oligarchs are getting hit by the country's crisis, according to the article: The London property market has already slowed down: According to the Office For National Statistics, prices in London were up by 17.2% in the year to October. That's actually a drop from the increases seen earlier in the year. However, most analysts aren't putting that down to fewer Russian buyers. The ruble has now declined to such an extent that buying property in another currency, like sterling, is about twice as expensive as it was at the beginning of the year. Ordinary Russians are lining up to get hold of dollars, and they are panic-buying in stores. Some real-estate experts are even more unequivocal about the disappearance of Russian buyers from the market. This from Bloomberg again: Russian buyers had previously been the biggest international market for London property, but they've been supplanted this year by French and Italian purchasers. If the trend continues, Russian buyers are likely to fall well behind a lot of other countries too.    FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersPeople push a shopping cart past a warehouse of the Swedish furniture maker IKEA in Bordeaux SEOUL (Reuters) - Iconic Swedish furniture retailer IKEA built its biggest store in the world to serve South Korea's shrinking households, targeting millions of people living alone with Korea-only items like super-sized single beds and in-store kimchi rice. The store opened on Thursday in Gwangmyeong, less than an hour's drive or 14 minutes by train from central Seoul, with a sales space nearly as big as the Louvre museum at 59,000 square meters. The previous record-holder at IKEA, known for its inexpensive, self-assembly products, was in Stockholm spanning 55,200 square meters. Stiff domestic competition and sluggish spending have made South Korea an unhappy hunting ground for global retail giants like Wal-Mart and Carrefour, who exited years ago. But IKEA's design appeal to South Korea's urban crowds, and few big local rivals, leave it well placed, retail experts say. "Korea has a population structure that fits IKEA's basic growth DNA — demand from design-conscious one-person and two-people households," said Suh Yong-gu, professor of marketing at Sookmyung Women's University. With the world's fastest-aging population, South Korea's attraction has faded for general retailers. Private spending growth fell from 4.4 percent on-year in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2013. But IKEA, now present in 43 countries with 365 stores, could fill a niche as it plans to grow to five outlets by 2020. As younger people marry later or not at all, the number of one-person households in the nation of 51 million people will climb to 34.3 percent of the total by 2035 from 25.3 percent in 2012, according to Statistics Korea - and each home needs furniture. IKEA will offer a new challenge to the country's legion of furniture makers, many of which are small. About 61 percent of a total of 1,247 firms in 2012 employed less than 20 people, private think tank Hana Institute of Finance said. "I came because it's inexpensive and useful, and I wanted to buy after seeing for myself," said Woo Jin-sook, a 46-year old from Seoul. Woo said she took a day off work to be at the store's opening. Among the 8,600 items on sale, some were modified for local tastes. The "super-single" bed, brought specifically for Korea, offers sleepers up to 40 centimeters more snooze width than a standard single bed. Alongside its Swedish meatballs, the store's restaurant offers kimchi bibimbap, a rice bowl mixed with the spicy South Korean staple side dish, and Korean barbecue. "We never planned the biggest store, we just planned a big store, because we believe we need one for a 23-million city (the Seoul metropolitan area)," said Patrick Schuerpf, IKEA Korea's Country Project Manager.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude edged further above $61 a barrel on Thursday, after sharply lower prices forced companies to cut upstream investments around the world. Chevron Corp has put a plan to drill for oil in the Beaufort Sea in Canada's Arctic on hold indefinitely, while Marathon Oil cut its capital expenditure for next year by about 20 percent. Canadian oil producers also deepened 2015 spending cuts, as Husky Energy, MEG Energy and Penn West Petroleum joined those hacking back capital budgets in response to tumbling crude prices. Brent this week dipped to its lowest since May 2009 at $58.50 a barrel, falling close to 50 percent since late June due to rising production in the United States, weak economic growth and a decision by OPEC members last month not to cut output. "It looks like investors favor support around $60 a barrel," said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, adding that lower upstream investments could begin to affect prices from the second quarter of next year. "But with U.S. production still strong, the bearish trend looks set to continue for now. I think it's just a matter of time before Brent breaks below $60 again." Brent crude for February delivery was 21 cents higher at $61.39 a barrel at 0438 GMT (11:38 p.m. EST), after settling up $1.17 on Wednesday. OPEC members which backed an output cut at the group's meeting last month are coming around to the view of Saudi Arabia that they need to focus on market share, further reducing the chance of any action to defend prices. "The producers have not blinked. We are just watching and selling oil at whatever the price is," said a delegate from an OPEC country which in November had wanted an output cut. U.S. crude for January delivery, which expires after Friday's settlement, was up 8 cents at $56.55 a barrel. The contracts rose as high as $58.98 on Wednesday after weekly U.S. government oil data showed a big build in crude stockpiles at the Cushing oil hub. U.S. oil was also supported by the Federal Reserve's upbeat assessment of the economy after sending strong signals it was on track to raise interest rates next year.
