ShutterstockStocks are just points away from their all-time highs.  And there are plenty of arguments why this could be a top for the markets. But the bear case for stocks is mostly backwards-looking or based on short-term risks. Yes, global growth is slow. But the economy is still growing, and S&amp;P 500 companies are actively increasing exposures to regions where growth is hot. Yes, profit margins are near all-time highs. But it's a mistake to think things revert to the mean just for the sake of mean-reversion.  There are plenty of reasons why margins will stay high. Some skeptics think that the stock market is being driven by easy monetary policy.  And they warn of a time when the Fed tightens.  But evidence shows that stocks can continue to rally amid a tightening Fed. And the Fed is expected to remain easy for a long time. As you'll see, the bull case for stocks is quite robust.
Eric.Parker / FlickrTomorrow is a sleepy day for market moving events. There are no major corporate earnings releases scheduled and most of the economic reports are likely to have a limited impact on the markets. The most closely watched indicator, however, will be a report on the state of the U.S. services sector. Here's what you need to know (all times ET, consensus estimates from Bloomberg):
REUTERS/Petar KujundzicChina's National People's Congress (NPC) begins its annual plenary session today. Outgoing premier Wen Jiabao is delivering the Government Work Report today. This is considered the equivalent of the State of the Union speech. Here are some of the highlights via Xinhua: Bank of America's Ting Lu says the 7.5 percent target is "achievable", and he expects GDP growth of 8.1 percent. "The government has no intention to achieve a faster growth pace than 8.0%, and we believe that new leaders will take actions to curb investment."  For those disappointed by the money supply growth target, "monetary targets have lost their appeal and importance due to financial innovation and M2 will be biased downwards in coming years," writes Ting. Remember some of these targets were expected based on the Central Economic Work Conference in December last year. We have already said the NPC will vote on two key bills in the next two weeks, one on land reform and the other to merge the Ministry of Railways with the Ministry of Transportation. The meeting is expected to last till March 17. 
Bloomberg has released the first excerpts of Joe Scarborough's debate with Paul Krugman on the deficit and debt, which the latter says didn't go very well. In the first bit, Scarborough challenges Krugman on whether he thinks the U.S. should make any spending cuts in the next decade: SCARBOROUGH: “So you don't think we have to make any cuts whatsoever over the next decade.”  KRUGMAN: “I don't think we have to. If the economy recovers, we could start doing some cutting.  But we don't have for the next decade, right?  We don't have to.  We will eventually have to deal with health care costs.  We'll eventually have to deal with the costs of the programs we want.  But there is no urgency -- and 'no urgency' means not this year, not next year, not in the next five years, and arguably not in the next ten years.  And that's -- again, that's -- that's more or less what Ben Bernanke said, right?” In the second bite released by Bloomberg, Scarborough tells PBS' Charlie Rose that there should be immediate action on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to reduce the deficit. ROSE: “What would you do immediately to deal with the debt?” SCARBOROUGH: “You want to get the parties talking.  You want to get the White House.  You want to get Congress talking, and talk about what it — what's going to have to be done to address Medicare, to address Medicaid, to address Social Security, which is less of a problem, and my belief is — my concern about the crisis, like Bob Rubin said, you know, you never know when the crisis is going to hit.  My concern is that if we ignore all of these problems and we push them off for 10 years, we increase the likelihood of those crises.  I've said repeatedly on my show as well if we send the message that we're willing to do the responsible things, we're willing to make the tough choices, we're willing to ask Americans to sacrifice in the long-run to keep the entitlement program solvent.  I think that sends a strong message to the world markets, and I think that delays any possible crises.” The debate will air tonight on PBS at 11 p.m. ET, and we'll be providing live coverage. Bloomberg will also air it tomorrow night at 8 p.m.
China's National People's Congress, arguably its most important political event of the year, is on from March 5 - 17. This is the meeting that will see Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang appointed to the positions of president and premier respectively. We have already reported the highlights from outgoing premier Wen Jiabao's Government Work Report, the Chinese equivalent of the State of the Union speech. And we have mentioned the NPC will vote on two key bills in the next two weeks, one on land reform, and the other to merge the Ministry of Railways with the Ministry of Transportation.

Kevin Bauman Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has declared a financial emergency in the city of Detroit. He has also threatened to have an emergency financial manager take control over the troubled city after March 12 if local officials don't come up with a plan to remedy the city's troubled finances. Detroit has a $327 million budget deficit, and it's drowning in more than $14 billion in long-term debt. As it deals with its ongoing financial crisis, the city has instituted mandatory unpaid days off for many city workers and it has left many of its key service departments such as the police and fire departments underfunded. Once a prosperous hub for the American automotive industry, Detroit has seen its population dwindle from 1.8 million in 1950 to 706k in 2011. The beleaguered city has seen its neighborhoods abandoned, its properties vandalized, and its homes stripped of any valuable materials such as copper piping and roofing. And the images are stunning. Photographer Kevin Bauman has collected beautiful photos of 100 abandoned Detroit homes.
Gurdonark via FlickrNational home prices are expected to climb 0.6 percent in the next year, according to the latest home price report by Fiserv Case-Shiller. But over the next five years, home prices are expected to rise 3.3 percent. We drew on Fiserv Case-Shiller's latest data to identify the best housing markets for the next five years. The top 15 cities are ranked by the projected annualized change in home prices between Q3 2012 and Q3 2017. We also included the median home price, median household income, unemployment rate, and the change in home prices since their peak, to offer a broader view of the local economy and housing market. Note: The median family income and home price is for Q3 2012. Unemployment data is as of December 2012, and population data for the metros is for 2011. Correction: The Norwich-New London data was corrected to reflectÂ  7.1% increase in home prices in the next five years.
YouTube screencapVornado's Steve RothEarlier this afternoon, CNBC's John Melloy reported that a major JC Penney shareholders was trying to dump 10 million shares of stock at a price range of $16.40 to $16.60. Melloy reports that the seller is Vornado Realty Trust, the company owned by real estate mogul Steve Roth. This is important because Roth was named to JC Penney's Board of Directors in January 2011.Â  Hedge funder Bill Ackman was named to the Board that same day. In Vornado's earnings conference call last week, an analyst asked Roth if being on JC Penney's board compromised his independence if he found himself wanting to exit his investment. "Yes," responded Roth. But if Melloy's report is true, it would appear that Roth has no qualms about dumping shares. This comes in the wake of a JC Penney's disastrous fourth quarter report where management reported a massive net loss as same-store sales dived 32 percent. Shares of JCP are plunging during the after hours session.Â  Here's a look at the action via MarketWatch: MarketWatch
A 10 million share block in troubled retailer JCPenney was being shopped Monday by Deutsche Bank's trading desk, according to multiple sources. The asking price of the block owned by Vornado Realty Trust was for a range between $16.40 and $16.60, one source confirmed, valuing the stake between $164 million and $166 million. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, Vornado Realty Trust and Dodge &amp; Cox were the biggest holders in the stock, each owning more than 20 million shares, according to the latest filings. JCPenney shares are down 16 percent this year alone after the company reported a 28 percent slide in fourth quarter sales. This most recent sales speedbump has tried the patience of many holders waiting for a turnaround from CEO Ron Johnson, who joined the firm from Apple in June 2011.
Paul Krugman and Joe Scarborough went mano-a-mano in a taped debate with Charlie Rose earlier on deficits and spending. As you should know by now, Krugman is arguing for aggressive spending, and a massive de-prioritization of the deficit as an economic concern. Scarborough is the consummate grand bargaineer, and thinks it's important to do something fast on long-term entitlement spending. The debate airs tonight, and our Brett Logiurato is covering it LIVE at 11 PM. But it looks like Krugman whiffed. In a post titled "Urk" he writes (Via @buzzfeedben): Well, weâ€™ll see how it comes out after editing, but I feel that I just had my Denver debate moment: I was tired, cranky, and unready for the blizzard of misleading factoids and diversionary stuff (In 1997 you said that the aging population was a big problem! When Social Security was founded life expectancy was only 62!) Oh, and I wasnâ€™t prepared for Joe Scarboroughâ€™s slipperiness about what he actually advocates (heâ€™s for more spending in the near term? Who knew?). We'll know more soon enough. UPDATE: Via email, Krugman explains a little bit more about what happened: Don't know what will make it into the program. But it was many of the usual zombies -- the US could handle debt after WWII only because all our competitors were in ruins, the Social Security age 62 plus the irrelevant 15 to 1 ratio from 1950, and the risk of a bond attack from nowhere -- all the stuff I've dealt with repeatedly on the blog, but wasn't prepared to rebut effectively all over again. Oh, and Charlie raised the damned Reinhart-Rogoff 90 percent.
China may be the world’s economic beacon of hope, but its pollution problems are hurting the bottom line. While China is a leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar panels, it also is home to seven of the world’s 10 most polluted cities, according to a study from the Asian Development Bank and Beijing’s Tsinghua University. The coal, freight trucks and factories underpinning China’s economic success in recent years are also hurting its environment. Last year, China consumed as much coal as the rest of the world combined, noted Jennifer Turner, director of the China Environment Forum &amp; Global Sustainability and Resilience Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The Cost of Smog Various studies have estimated the economic impact of China’s pollution, and several sources suggest that illness, premature death and lost productivity could be costing the country upwards of $100 billion a year. The World Bank estimated that illnesses and premature deaths linked to China’s pollution cost it about $100 billion – the equivalent of 3 percent of the country’s annual gross domestic product – in 2009 alone. A separate study by Greenpeace and Peking University estimates particulate pollution cost four major cities more than $1 billion and caused more than 8,000 premature deaths last year. “China’s economy has skyrocketed, but at a price. Power plants, factories and heavy industries are all belching out black, dirty air, at the cost of our health and our environment,” Greenpeace said. Data suggests the country’s pollution and related costs may not ease anytime soon. Coal remains a dominant source of power for the country, and citizens are snapping up automobiles at a frenzied pace. Chinese residents bought nearly 20 million automobiles last year, making it the world’s largest auto consumer. SUV sales alone in China are expected to triple in the next decade, according to the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. Long-Term Costs A study released last year by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates labor and health care costs related to China’s pollution cost the economy $112 billion in 2005 — five times as much as in 1975. Rapid urbanization, booming population growth and rising incomes, which increase the value of lost productivity, all contribute to the problem. But the MIT study aimed to quantify the long-term price of pollution, as well as the immediate costs. The results suggest “that conventional, static methods that neglect the cumulative impact of pollution-caused welfare damage or other market distortions substantially underestimate pollution’s health costs, particularly in fast-growing economies like China,” Kyung-Min Nam, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement released last year in conjunction with the study. The researchers found that China emits more mercury, carbon dioxide and other pollutants than any other country in the world. Even before its latest boom, China in the 1980s had pollution levels 10 to 16 times higher than guidelines provided by the World Health Organization, the MIT study said. Hurting the China Brand  Environmental issues are one reason some companies have a harder time getting workers to relocate to China. “You actually have to pay people more to go live in China, partly because of the pollution issues,” Turner, of the Woodrow Wilson Center, said. In fact, more Chinese workers also are choosing to telecommute in order to avoid having to step outside, Turner said. Some are reluctant to let children play outside, and the Financial Times has reported that schools in Beijing are building pollution domes to cover outdoor play areas. Turner expects continued problems could ultimately temper investors’ interest. “You have some international companies thinking, ‘We have to get out of Dodge and produce our products safely,’” she said. “You can run, but you can’t hide from this kind of smog.”
Because the long ordeal of our latest banking crisis is ending, I think it is only appropriate to look at the U.S. financial banking record to see how well the different banks performed during the crisis.  Before looking at the banks individually, however, I think it is worthwhile to show the reader how three different groups of banks faired during the crisis.  The three bank groups that I am going to discuss in this article are defined below:  As I have mentioned in earlier articles for Business Insider, signs of our latest banking crisis began showing up prior to the financial quarter ending 12/31/2007 and signs of its unofficial ending is beginning to show up now--twenty-quarters later, the financial quarter ending 09/30/2012.  Since everyone knows that bad lending was the key proponent behind the crisis, I thought it prudent to look first at how the bank loan portfolios of the different bank groupings performed during the crisis.  Exhibit 1 below tracks the loan performance of the different bank groups throughout the crisis season.  This exhibit shows the percentage of loan assets that were non-performing (i.e., delinquent more than 90 days, in foreclosure, or assigned to the bank) as reported to the Federal Government at the end of each quarter. Exhibit 1 Jim Boswell I have to admit that I was not all that surprised when I first looked at the above statistics.  Exhibit 1 shows that the loan performance of the Big Four banks was substantially worse throughout the crisis season than the other two banking groups that I had identified.  Not only were the Big Four worse throughout the crisis, they are still worse at the end of the crisis, showing even less improvement late in our crisis period than the other two bank groups. But even as important as the non-performing loan asset measurement of Exhibit 1 is, I knew it was important to dig deeper into the statistics.  Since the above statistic considers only those loans still on the books, it was only prudent to also look at the loans that had been written off as losses and removed from the books during the crisis period.  Therefore, I created Exhibit 2, which shows the relative percent of loan assets that each bank group had identified as losses on their income statements at the end of each of the twenty-quarters of our long crisis season. Exhibit 2  Jim Boswell Exhibit 2 shows that the Big Four were outperformed by the other two of my bank groupings in terms of actual loan losses, too.  Not only that, the exhibit shows that the smaller banks as a group outperformed the Big Four throughout the crisis.  Quarter after quarter after quarter, the Big Four took greater losses as a percentage of their loans than the other two bank groups.  But loan losses only tell part of the story.  Asset and loan growth are also important to the health of the banking industry.  Exhibit 3 below provides a table that shows the amount of loan assets and total assets for each of my three bank groups as reported at the quarter ending 12/31/2007 (the beginning of the financial crisis) and for the last reported quarter ending 09/30/2012. Exhibit 3 Change in Total Assets and Loan Assets by Bank Group From 12/31/2007 to 09/30/2012 (Dollars in Billions) Jim Boswell Interesting, isn’t it?  Total Banking Assets during the twenty-quarter period of our crisis increased by $1.2 Trillion from $13.0 Trillion to $14.2 Trillion.  During the crisis period, the banking assets of the Big Four, the Next Thirteen, and all the Small/Mid banks changed by $1.3 Trillion, $1.0 Trillion, and ($1.2 Trillion), respectively.  The Big Four now manage 39.9% of all banking loan assets, up from 33.1% at the time that our latest banking crisis began.  Go figure. Yes, I know that statistics can lie and that we should be grateful that Wells Fargo took over Wachovia; Bank of America—Countrywide; and JPMorgan/Chase—Washington Mutual, during the crisis.  But sometimes I wonder.   Weren’t the operations of most of the banks closed down by the FDIC during the crisis taken over by the smaller and mid-sized banks?  The above analysis makes me wonder whether we learned anything from our latest crisis.  Personally, based upon the above statistics I remain in doubt.  Oh, and I already know, so please don’t get me started on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—the real culprits behind the mess that turned our economy upside down.  They, too, are still operating fat, dumb, and happy. Next week I am providing Business Insider a view of how each of the individual Big Four banks performed during the crisis.  Like I have said before “not all banks are created equal”, and that holds true for Goldman Sachs and each of the Big Four, too.
GettyVirginia Republican Rep. Rob Wittman is warning that the forced spending cuts known as the sequester could put servicemembers' "lives in the balance" because of the drastic cuts to the nation's defense sector. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Wittman, a Republican who represents Virginia's defense-heavy first district, said that sequestration will cost 200,000 jobs and create a wave of uncertainty for the state. On top of that, he said, military officials he has spoken to have said that the cuts could drastically reduce the nation's military readiness. "Men and women's lives are at stake," Wittman told Business Insider. "They tell me there's increased risk. And 'increased risk' is just a polite way to say that more lives are in the balance and more people could die. It's not a choice we want to make." The deadline to avert the forced cuts came and went on Friday, and President Barack Obama signed a sequestration order to place the law into effect.  In Virginia, 90,000 civilian Department of Defense employees will be furloughed if the sequester takes effect, which means a $648.4 million reduction in gross pay. The Army would have to cut the state's base funding by around $146 million; the Air Force would cut operations by about $8 million; and the Navy would be forced to cancel the maintenance of 11 shifts in Norfolk and defer and delay other ship projects. In Wittman's district, more than 100,000 people are employed by the government, and the Department of Defense is the second-largest employer. Virginia's First Congressional District is home to a Naval Weapons Station; Fort A.P. Hill, a training site for some units; the Naval Surface Warfare Center, a site that tests some long-range, large-caliber weapons; and a Marine Corps Base at Quantico. Other major military installations lie just outside of the district, and employ some of its residents.  Unlike fellow Virginia Republican Rep. Scott Rigell — who told reporters last week during a trip with Obama that he would be willing to include revenues in a bill to avert the sequester — Wittman has taken a stance more in line with his party leadership. Revenue-boosting measures, he said, were out of the equation. For Wittman, the road forward on sequestration appears to be through the continuing resolution bill, which would the government funded at the current, lower rate of operations.  "We want to mitigate the most troubling parts," Wittman said. "It's troubling the magnitude of what's being placed on defense." House Republicans introduced a bill on Monday that attempts to brunt the sequester's effect by giving the Pentagon more flexibility in how it allocates its cuts. The bill, introduced by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, generally gives military branches more room to move around spending.  It also swings $10.4 billion in the budget to the Pentagon's operation and maintenance accounts to relieve the pressure on some key maintenance programs. It also includes an additional $2 billion in funding for embassy security, and would allow Customs and Border Protection to maintain current staffing levels.
Private Islands OnlineThe suitor is one of the world's wealthiest men; the location happens to be the eurozone's poorest country. But in an unlikely coming together of economic circumstances, the emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, has opted to splash out â‚¬8.5m (Â£7.35m) on six idyllic isles in the Ionian sea. Closure of the deal â€“ the latest in a global shopping spree that has seen the sheikh's property portfolio spread from London to Beijing â€“ has been met with glee in Greece, the west's most bankrupt state, and Doha, where the royal household experienced 18 months of excruciating drama to take possession of the outcrops. "Greece is that kind of place," said Ioannis Kassianos, Ithaca's straight-talking Greek-American mayor. "Even when you buy an island, even if you are the emir of Qatar, it takes a year and a half for all the paperwork to go through." The isles, known as the Echinades, caught the oil-rich monarch's fancy when he moored his super-yacht in the turquoise waters off Ithaca, took in the view and liked what he saw. That was four summers ago. When the royal eventually got off the yacht, he inquired about the pine-covered chain as he strolled about Ithaca in sandals and shorts. "They have a fund with a couple of hundred million in it," enthused Kassianos, a former US economics professor who assumed the mayorship of Homer's fabled isle three years ago. "And as far as I know they want to buy all 18 of the islands, the whole lot." The purchase, the biggest private investment in Greece, appears to have been a windfall for the emir, who drove a hard bargain in a market where investors are few and far between. The first island, Oxia, initially came with a price tag of â‚¬7m before its Greek-Australian owners agreed to let it go for just under â‚¬5m. Last week, Denis Grivas, whose family has owned the title deeds to the other five almost since the foundation of modern Greece, also settled on a price. "The islands have been in my family for over 150 years but we are not rich enough to be able to keep such valuable properties any longer," he said, ruing the soaring taxes the crisis-hit Greek state has slapped on real estate. "We are very, very happy to see them go. They have been on the market for nearly 40 years." With their pristine beaches, ancient olive orchards and natural coves, the uninhabited isles are "an ideal opportunity for a solid business investment with unlimited possibilities", says the high-end "private island online" site, describing the properties as Mediterranean pearls. "The potential for development is very big â€¦ from developing tourist-style Club Meds or hotel facilities, to villas to sell or rent." But the Gulf royal does not appear in any mood to create tourist resorts on the retreats. Instead, said Kassianos, his aim is to build palaces for the exclusive pleasure of his 24 children and three wives. The architects have already moved in, drawing up plans to create a private idyll, although he has run into trouble with Greek law. "There is a stupid law because in Greece we do everything upside down," lamented Kassianos. "That law says that whatever the size of your land, your home can be no bigger than 250 sq m. The emir has reacted to this saying his WC is 250 sq m and his kitchen alone has to be 1,000 sq m, because otherwise how is he going to feed all his guests?" To appease the locals, the Qatari, who is also being heavily courted by the government to invest in Greece, has promised to come bearing gifts. "His people said 'what present can we give you?' and I said the island needs water desperately," said Kassianos. "A study to lay a pipeline from the mainland is already under way. That's not bad when we've been trying to get a new port here for the past 40 years." The emir plans to moor his yacht off his new property this summer. Locals on Ithaca are getting ready. An honorary citizenship beckons along with a feast fit for a very modern Homeric hero. "The next time he comes we hope to get him and his family off his yacht and into our restaurants," said Ithaca's mayor. This is not the first time the 56-year-old emir of Qatar has shown interest in Greece. Three years ago, when the country's economic crisis erupted, the Gulf kingdom pledged to invest as much as â‚¬5bn in real estate, tourism, transport and infrastructure, including habours and airports. But perennial delays and the perils of Greece's Byzantine bureaucracy were such that Qatar pulled out of the projects. Last month, following a visit to Doha by the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, interest was rekindled when Qatar signed up to take part in an international tender to develop Athens' former international airport at Elliniko, one of the most sort after slices of real estate in Europe. The Gulf state has also shown interest in purchasing the famous beachfront Astir Palace hotel, once a stomping ground for celebrities outside the capital. The emir may be rich but he is business savvy. He had wanted to buy the Ionian isle of Skorpios, where Jackie Kennedy married Aris Onassis. The deal fell through when the late shipowner's granddaughter, Athina Onassis, refused to come down in price. She is selling for â‚¬200m.  This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
ShutterstockThe Ivy League may claim to be cracking down on fraternity and sorority hazing, but the practice appears to be alive and well on Columbia University's campus. Bwog, the online version of Columbia's monthly undergrad magazine, claims to have obtained a copy of one fraternity's scavenger hunt, which a tipster supposedly found in a printer. The frat in question wasn't dumb enough to include its name on the print-out, but New York Magazine points to Pi Kappa Alpha as the culprit. The scavenger hunt includes some silly tasks (Picture in front of Mei Dick barber shop: 5 pts) and some that are totally awful: Piss on Church of Scientology (minimum 1 picture): 15 pts Panties from XXL girl: 5 pts Video of motor-boating a girl: 10 pts Think it all sounds like harmless fun? Scavenger hunts are considered hazing on college campuses. The Fraternal Information Programming Group (via StopHazing.org) defines hazing as: Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol; paddling in any form; creation of excessive fatigue; physical and psychological shocks; quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste; engaging in public stunts and buffoonery; morally degrading or humiliating games and activities; and any other activities which are not consistent with fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution."

YouTubeCaddisfly larva hatching from a golden shell A notable feature of the investment landscape over the past few months has been the 12 percent drop in the price of gold since September. During that time, we've heard some incredibly bearish calls on gold from strategists at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, among other shops. Rising real interest rates are said to be the death knell for gold. Morgan Stanley, which for a while has touted gold as its number-one investment idea in the commodity space, isn't ready to throw in the towel just yet. In fact, according to the bank's Chief Metals Economist, Peter Richardson, "The reasons for owning gold may be evolving." What does that mean, exactly? Richardson argues that over the past 10 years, gold has actually undergone numerous evolutions in this manner. From 2001 to 2008, Richardson writes, gold went up because of "1) a persistent increase in investment demand, 2) acceleration in producer de-hedging, 3) a decline in net official sector sales, and 4) a persistent failure on the part of the mining companies to respond to the incentive of a steadily rising price and materially lift production." Then, from 2008 to 2012, gold was driven higher by "investors’ waning confidence in the stability of the global financial system and an unprecedented monetary easing by central banks." In 2011, though, gold became tightly correlated with the trade-weighted U.S. dollar. Richardson attributes this to slowly declining financial stress and less surprises on the central bank liquidity front as time progressed. "As this has happened, gold has returned to what BCA Research Inc has called its default setting – a tick-for-tick correlation with a range-bound US dollar in TWI terms. In the past, these periods of particularly strong and close correlation with the USD have proven to be consolidation phases before the next upside gold catalyst has appeared," writes Richardson. The chart below shows this latest "evolution." Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley Research What happens next? Morgan Stanley's house view as espoused by Richardson is that "we are about to witness the third installment of the Great Monetary Easing." That's a reference to the extremely loose monetary policy set to hit Japan and the attempts of other countries to not let their currencies strengthen too much in the face of a weaker Japanese yen. To sum it all up, Richardson concludes, "In these circumstances, we believe that gold has demonstrated considerable technical strength, offers good value at current prices both as an entry level to the trading range between US$1,540/oz and US$1,800/oz and as an option on any remaining upside surprise above this range that might result from the third part of the Great Monetary Easing." That's why Morgan Stanley remains bullish on gold for now.
FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Current U.S. Monetary And Fiscal Policy Are Unsustainable (Advisor Perspectives) According to John Hussman of Hussman funds, government intervention, or monetary and fiscal policy, is getting to a point where the long-term costs will greatly outweigh current short-term benefits. Right now, U.S. Treasury debt exceeds 105 percent of GDP, and the Fed has expanded the monetary base to more than 18 percent of GDP. According to Hussman, this is highly unsustainable and massive inflation is inevitable. "A century of U.S. economic history indicates that a normalization to Treasury bill yields of just 2 percent could not tolerate more than 9 cents of monetary base per dollar of GDP without inflation," he said, in the note. Markets Are Rallying Because Of Strong Fundamentals AND Easy Money (Morgan Stanley) There are two theories going around that explain why the stock market has been ticking upwards: 1) easy money and a dovish Fed, and 2) strong fundamentals. Morgan Stanley's Gerard Minack demonstrates what each thesis looks like in charts. This chart correlates the stock market with the Fed's expanding balance sheet: Morgan Stanley And this one stock market valuations with economic surprises: Morgan Stanley Minack believes that stocks are more likely being driven by fundamentals because easy monetary policy hasn't benefited other international markets. No One Knows What The SEC Expects Of Brokers And Advisors (Wall Street Journal) Right now, investment advisors are bound by law to act in their clients best interests. Brokers, however, are not.Â  They simply have to make sure that their investment advice is suitable for clients. TheÂ Securities and Exchange Commission has been authorized to impose a common standard on the two, but they haven't yet done so. The SEC is currently seeking input and might eventually create a new framework of ethical standards under which all brokers and registered investment advisers would operate.Â  But so far, it's hard to tell what changes they will actually implement. Gold Is Falling Because Investors Expect Interest Rates To Normalize (Business Insider) When interest rates rise, gold prices fall. The inverse correlation between 5-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) and the price of gold is tight. Take a look: Bloomberg, Business Insider When the gold sell-off began in November, it was because of a slight uptick in 5-year TIPS yields. But ever since, 5-year TIPS yields haven't moved much, but gold had continued to fall. This is probably because the market expects that bond yields will eventually rise. Wealth Managers Are Bullish On Stocks, Less So On Bonds (Barron's) According to an annual survey by Penta, wealth managers are recommending that their clients invest more money in stocks and less in bonds than they did last year. Both wealth managers and clients are worried that interest rates will rise, which would hurt bond values. This could mean that the market isÂ beginning to normalize, Chris Wolfe, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, told Barron's. This also supports the idea that a "great rotation" of money out of bonds and into stocks is taking place.
Independent Apple analyst Andy Zaky lost $10.6 million of investors' money thanks to Apple's crash, Philip Elmer-DeWitt at Fortune reports. He lost even more money for people who listened to his Apple analysis, but didn't invest directly with him, says Elmer-DeWitt. Zaky gained fame in the Apple blogging world by making wildly bullish forecasts about Apple that proved to be fairly accurate. As he became better known, he set up his own fund; Bullish Cross Capital L.P., which Elmer-DeWitt describes as "basically an Apple-only hedge fund". When Apple was a rocketship screaming to the sky independent analysts like Zaky were lauded in the Apple blogging world. They made the more conservative professional sell-side analysts look like chumps by printing wildly bullish estimates that came close to what Apple actually did. This worked very well until it didn't. When Apple stopped crushing earnings, the indy analysts didn't seem all that smart. When Apple's stock started crashing, they missed it. Zaky missed it, too, costing his investors millions. Zaky made five different price target calls on Apple. The first four went very well. The last one did not. His most recent call on Apple was on October 16. He said the stock was going to $1,000. Influential Apple blogger John Gruber linked to Zaky's analysis, writing, "I don’t offer investment advice, but Andy Zaky does — and those who listen to him have done pretty well." In this case, people that listened to Zaky did not do well. What's worse is that Zaky reportedly whiffed on both of Apple's big rallies last year. Elmer-DeWitt says he missed when Apple raced to $700 in September, and missed when it raced to $644 in April. To make up for the April miss, he invested in Apple calls in May, which didn't work out. (Calls are bets the stock will be worth more in the future.) As Apple crashed last fall, he once again invested in calls, which ended up losing all of his investors' money. What's worse, from Elmer-DeWitt's perspective, is that Zaky had a newsletter with 700 subscribers. A lot of those people were not sophisticated investors who understood the risks of listening to Zaky. Those people that followed his advice lost all their money. The sad lesson of this story: Be careful who you're listening to when it comes to investment advice, and avoid trying to buy and sell individual stocks. We reached out to Zaky for comment, but he hasn't responded. He told Elmer-DeWitt, "The bottom line is we didn't expect Apple to crash 40% of its value inside of a few months and trade at a 10 P/E ratio given its cash flows. We were on the bull side of the Apple case and it didn't work. I wish I could give you more, but then it would just look like a complicated set of excuses. And what's the point." Zaky has shifted his focus away from Apple to SPY, an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500, says Elmer-DeWitt. Read the full story on Zaky at Fortune &gt;
tuancoi1 via flickr Today Forbes came out with its latest billionaires list. After the publication of the 2013 edition, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal has informed the publication that he would no longer like to be included (thank-you-very-much). According to a press release from the Prince's investment firm, Kingdom Holding Company, he sent a letter to Steve Forbes severing his relationship with the list. That means Forbes will no longer receive information from Kingdom about its finances. Kingdom claims that it has discovered "what appear to be intentional biases and inconsistencies in the Forbes valuation process..." From the press release: Shadi Sanbar, CFO of Kingdom Holding explained, “We have worked very openly with the Forbes team over the years and have on multiple occasions pointed out problems with their methodology that need correction. However, after several years of our efforts to correct mistakes falling on deaf ears, we have decided that Forbes has no intention of improving the accuracy of their valuation of our holdings and we have made the decision to move on. KHC puts a premium on tracking the true value of our investments and it is contrary to both our practice and nature to assist in the publication of financial information we know to be false and inaccurate.” This year Kingdom says it found four glaring errors/inconsistencies in Forbes' reporting (from the press release): The real killer here is at the end of the release where Kingdom says that it will continue to work with Forbes' rival list, the Bloomberg Billionaires List, since they " use a more accurate method of calculating financial holdings." Brutal. Forbes responded to these allegations in an e-mail to Business Insider saying, "Prince Alwaleed has issued a press release in response to fact-checking questions from Forbes. For our 27th annual Billionaires ranking, released today, Forbes has listed Alwaleed at $20 billion, which is $2 billion more than what he was listed at last year but $9.6 billion less than he claims he is worth. Forbes has been investigating the prince’s finances for several years, and will detail its findings in a feature story in the magazine, which will be released online tomorrow morning."

BloombergEarlier we noted that with Apple shares falling below $425, it was another feather in the cap for investing god Jeff Gundlach, who predicted last year that Apple would hit this level in 2013. It's important to note what a good call this was. Back at the time the stock was close to $600. We asked Gundlach, via email, whether he had any additional thoughts on Apple's remarkable decline. His short reply is that the decline is a milestone for market theory: AAPL over the last six months offers a textbook case study in market behavior and effectively debunks efficient market theories.   The weakness is all the more remarkable because it has occurred within the context of a strong overall US stock market.  SPX up 5% since September 19, 2012 and AAPL down 40%. The efficient markets hypothesis basically states the markets are always accurately factoring in all relevant information about a security, and are pricing said security "correctly." From his viewpoint, this proves that markets are not perfectly rational and efficient digesters of news and data, but rather the product of herds and behavioral idiosyncracies, at least sometimes. Apple is a shining example of how it all works. For more on Jeffery's big call, see here &gt;
WikimediaNow that sequestration has hit, people are wondering whether we're going to see another 1937. That's the year that brought America a 12-month-long "recession-within-a-depression." The Dow also fell 47 percent. But there remains disagreement about what caused this event. Keynesians like Paul KrugmanÂ argueÂ it was indeed the result of Roosevelt's decision to curb New Deal spending. Monetarists, meanwhile, believe fears of inflation choked off business spending. And still a third prominent economist, Dartmouth's Douglas Irwin,Â has recently writtenÂ it was the result of gold sterilization â€” that is, federal gold reserves out of the monetary supply. Before we determine who's right, we wanted to go back and see what contemporary accounts were saying.
Thereâ€™s this idea out there that the Bernanke Fed is a) somehow aiding and abetting Washingtonâ€™s deficit spendingÂ by monetizing government debt, and b) risking the creation of dangerous asset bubbles. So the Fed should end its QE program ASAP and start raising interest rates, right? Actually, thatâ€™s a recipe for making the US debt problem worse. MKMâ€™s Mike Darda If the Fed were to prematurely tighten (which in our view makes no sense after a huge NGDP/velocity shock and the high unemployment and low inflation that has followed) long rates would probably fall as expectations of future growth weakened. This has happened countless times in Japan over the last 12 years, one of the key reasons Japanâ€™s debt/GDP ratio has continued to march ever higher. Along these lines, it is worth pointing out that in countries with their debt funded in local currency and with their own central banks, long rates are a reflection of expected future short rates, which are driven by expected future NGDP and the central banksâ€™ reaction function thereto. One way to observe this is to look at the tight linkage between the velocity of money in the U.S. and the level of long rates (correlation 0.93 out of 1). Critically, long rates in the U.S. bear no relationship either to the fiscal deficit (as a fraction of GDP) or the debt/GDP ratio. In other words, comparing countries without their own central banks or local currency debt (i.e., euro zone PIIGS or the dollar linked Asian/Latin countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s) to the U.S., U.K., Japan, etc. is akin to comparing apples to oranges. Weak nominal GDP growth is a surefire way to make a debt problem a whole lot worse. Just ask Europe.
Billions of dollars really do grow on trees â€“â€“ at least for the handful of Forbes' 2013 BillionairesÂ who didn't have to work for their ten-figure bank accounts. Of more than 1,400 billionaires listed, Forbes listed "inherited" as the source of income for only a handful.  Though we are sure there are other billionaires whose wealth came by way of inheritance (Sam Walton's billionaire heirs, for one), we are highlighting the ones Forbes specifically calls out. We've taken a closer look at how they found their way to riches. Forbes ranking:Â #1175Net Worth:Â $1.2 billionAge: 75Country: Monaco Lily Safra, 75, owes her wealth to her late husband, billionaire banker Edmond Safra, who died in a 1999 apartment fire, according to Forbes. The well-heeled widow is the third wealthiest person in her native Monaco.Â Â  Charitable giving:Â Safra made headlines in 2012 when sheÂ auctioned off a 70-piece collectionÂ of jewelry to benefit nearly three dozen charities. The lot sold for an astounding $38 million. Forbes ranking:Â #145Net Worth:Â $8 billionAge: 70Country: U.S. The 48th wealthiest woman in the U.S., Elaine Marshall inherited her billions from her late husband, J. Pierce Marshall in the form of a 14.6 percent stake in Koch Industries. The funny thing is no one knew about her fortune untilÂ Bloomberg named her the 4th richest womanÂ in the U.S. in 2012. Â  Fun fact:Â She's the daughter-in-law of Anna Nicole Smith, who was married to Elaine's late father. Forbes ranking:Â #233Net Worth: $5.2 billionAge: 53Country: SwedenÂ  Swedish billionaire Jorn Rausing may have inherited his $5.2 billion fortune from his late mother, Birgit, but he hasn't used that as an excuse to escape the working world. Rausing sits on the board of Tetra Laval, the company his grandfather founded that is responsible for the Tetra Pak â€“â€“ the special boxes used to store milk and juices without refrigeration, according to Forbes. Fun fact: A plan to kidnap Jorn by pro-Palestinian terrorists was thwarted in 1989. Forbes ranking:Â #239Net Worth: $5.1 billionAge: 58Country: Sweden Along with younger brother Jorn, Finn Rausing sits on the board of Tetra Pak-maker Tetra Laval. He's the fifth richest person in Sweden, behind Jorn, who's the fourth. Forbes ranking:Â #704Net Worth: $2.1 billionAge: 49Country: Peru Peru's fourth richest man, Eduardo Hochschild owed his wealth to his great uncle, who founded hte wildly successful Peruvian gold and silver mining company in 1911, according to forbes. Hochschild studied science in the U.S. at Tufts University and firstÂ joined Hochschild Mining in 1987 as a safety assistant. Like another billionaire heir, Jorn Rausing, Hochschild survived a kidnapping. A gunman killed his father and Hochschild was held captive for six days before his release.Â  Forbes ranking:Â #1342Â Net Worth: $1 billionAge: 72Country: Japan When Minoru Mori, one of Japan's most powerful real estate tycoons, passed away last year, his wife, Yoshiko, took over the family fortune. She's now ranked the 20th richest person in Japan. According to Forbes, her late husband was most known for building China's tallest building, the ShanghaiÂ World Financial Center.Â 
The recent rally in U.S. gas prices has some economists worried that the consumer is taking a beating right now, especially considering the recent payroll tax hike. But Deutsche Bank's Carl Riccadonna believes that concerns about higher gas prices may be premature. "Gasoline prices are up roughly 16% since mid-December; however, the trend to date is not particularly unusual," write Riccadonna.  "Gas prices have a distinct seasonal pattern: Typically, they rise in the first half of the year, plateau during the peak summer driving season and retrace most of the earlier gains in the back half of the year." And that's exactly what appears to be going on now. "As last reported, the average retail price for regular grade gasoline was $3.78 per gallon. This compares to an average of $2.78 per gallon in 2010, $3.52 in 2011 and $3.62 in 2012. At face value, the $0.53 per gallon price increase from mid-December is troubling, but this is actually relatively consistent with the regular seasonal pattern." Indexed to 2012 gas prices, it looks like prices this year are just following the normal seasonal trajectory it always does. Here's the chart Riccadonna provides: Deutsche Bank
The Volcker rule - named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law - is expected to limit bank investments in private equity funds, but not necessarily private equity-style investments outside of a formal fund structure. In a bid to pool money for deals without raising a private equity fund, the Wall Street bank has been lining up clients who are willing to put money into accounts set up to invest in private equity-style deals, the sources said. Goldman would also set aside some of its own money and partner capital into separate accounts for the same purpose, they said. Under the new plan, Goldman would then make investments in a syndicate fashion, contributing investor money, along with its own capital and partner dollars, the sources said. That would be different from a traditional private equity fund, where money from various investors has already been pooled together in a formal fund structure. "It is the same pitch as before, 'We are putting a lot of our own money in this,'" said a person familiar with Goldman's marketing of the new business. "They are saying, 'We are still in this business.'" The details of the new structure, including whether Goldman would still get fees for managing client money and how profits would be taxed, could not be learned. Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said on Monday that the firm is merely taking a strategy used in other investment businesses and applying it to private equity. "We believe these investments will continue to be important to our clients and the economy, more broadly," Raphael said. "We will, of course, comply with all aspects of the Volcker rule as it is finalized." VOLCKER RULE The Volcker rule aims to limit banks' exposure to these kinds of investments. The rule, which has not been implemented yet, will allow firms to place up to 3 percent of their Tier 1 capital into private equity funds. It will also prevent them from contributing more than 3 percent of any new private equity funds they raise. A draft version of the rule appears to allow banks to continue making private equity investments, as long as the investments do not reside in a fund structure. "It's not a model of statute writing," said Dwight Smith, an attorney at Morrison &amp; Foerster who focuses on bank regulation. "In terms of merchant banking and direct investments in portfolio companies as opposed to investing in funds, those are fine and not subject to Volcker at all." Some major banks such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc have been pulling back from private equity investments ahead of the rule. But others, including Goldman and Wells Fargo &amp; Co, are betting that workarounds will help them retain at least some lines of business. Returns from private equity investments can be high. But they are also risky. The largest leveraged buyout, the $45 billion takeover of Texas utility TXU in 2007, has turned into one of the most spectacular failures of the last decade's buyout boom. Goldman was part of the private equity consortium that took TXU private. The company is now known as Energy Future Holdings. Since the financial reform law passed in 2010, Goldman has shut down its proprietary trading desks and outlined plans to gradually wind down its stakes in hedge funds each quarter to prepare for Volcker rule. But it also gathered a team of lawyers, lobbyists and strategists to devise arguments that would protect as much of its proprietary investing business as possible, sources said. The central argument that emerged from their effort was that activities like merchant banking and debt investing through credit funds should be exempt from the rule - or parts of it - because they are akin to making loans, the sources said. PARTNER MONEY Goldman has a long history of successfully raising private equity funds that mix its own capital with money from employees and clients. GS Capital Partners VI, the largest such fund Goldman raised, closed in 2007 with $20.3 billion in assets, 45 percent of which came from the firm and its partners. Goldman's private equity assets represented 19 percent of its Tier 1 capital at year-end, though it is not clear how much of those assets are tied up in funds. Goldman partner capital is also invested in other types of investment vehicles, such as credit funds, and the firm has been trying to make sure they are exempt from Volcker restrictions as well. In a February 2012 meeting with the Federal Reserve, for example, Goldman executives argued that credit funds should not be subject to Volcker restrictions because investors typically require a 5 percent "skin in the game" from sponsors. Goldman's private equity and merchant banking businesses are large and lucrative, and hold a sizable portion of the personal wealth of senior Goldman executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, one of the sources said. Goldman is betting that its investments not tied up in funds will be protected from Volcker rule. Members of Goldman's regulatory reform group -- overseen by Harvey Schwartz, who is now chief financial officer, and John Rogers, who is chief of staff -- have given presentations to regulators about potential pitfalls of Volcker, and tried to educate the Fed and other regulators on the best way to write the rule, sources have said. One source who attended meetings with regulators said that officials seemed receptive to Goldman's arguments, but cautioned that they worried about banks becoming overexposed to risks in private equity investing. NEW PRIVATE EQUITY It is unclear when the final Volcker rule, which had been scheduled for July 2012, will be unveiled. It may not be fully implemented for years to come. In the meantime, a group of Goldman bankers, in the merchant banking division headed by Richard Friedman, have been pitching clients on the new way of co-investing in private equity deals with the firm. Tanya Barnes, a newly minted managing director, is one person working on the project, sources said. Barnes has a background in distressed debt investments and previously worked in Goldman's Special Situations Group. The firm has been upping its marketing game to persuade clients that the deals are worth their time, even though they are not in a traditional fund, one of the sources said. Smith, the attorney, said banks may still be required to reduce exposure to the merchant banking business. "The Federal Reserve has this inherent authority to tell banks not to do things even though it's technically legal for them to do so," he said. "The Fed could look at a bank's array of merchant banking activities and just say, 'Look, that's too much, even though you haven't triggered the Tier 1 capital limitation.'"

APThere's a new political party in Germany. Its major platform, headed into this year's German elections in September: abolishing the euro. The group, which calls itself "Alternative for Germany," is made up of several prominent economists and intellectuals with a reputation for euroscepticism. Deutsche Bank posted a nice summary of the movement today on its website â€“ who it is, what it's all about, and its chances for success. In the report, Deutsche Bank's Nicolaus Heinen explains who is behind Alternative: The movementÂ Alternative fÃ¼r DeutschlandÂ (Alternative for Germany) is centered around the German economist Bernd Lucke, a professor of macroeconomics in Hamburg. Other spokespersons are former FAZ journalist Konrad Adam and a former state secretary in Hesse, Alexander Gauland. Another prominent supporter is the former president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) Hans-Olaf Henkel â€“ a prominent and colourful eurosceptic who wrote a book about establishing a North-EMU and a South-EMU. Other supporters are well-known eurosceptic economists such as Stefan Homburg (Hanover), Charles Blankart (Berlin), Wilhelm Hankel and Karl Schachtschneider (both multiple plaintiffs at the German Constitutional Court of Justice in various euro-proceedings). Germany has arguably been the biggest winner from the creation of the euro. The currency bloc provides a relatively stable and low-cost destination for German exports. However, the idea of bailing out other countries, like Greece, Spain, Italy, and the like â€“ even though those countries were running up debt to buy German exports all of those years â€“ is still pretty cringeworthy in Germany. Alternative hopes to capitalize on that. Heinen notes that this isn't the first eurosceptic party to hit the German political scene, but it is the first one in a while. (The one Heinen recalls was established in the late 1990s but fizzled out after a few years.) The problems for these parties in the past have been four-fold, according to Heinen: fragmentation, money, content, and appeal. The situation now, amid the economic crisis engulfing the bloc, is dramatically different than then. So, how big of a problem for this new party do those four issues present? Here is Heinen's take: Fragmentation remains the crucial issue:Â The economists that make up the movement have quite differing views on how to achieve their political goals. They are just at the very beginning of their opinion-forming process. While their communication is professional, they have almost no experience in policymaking. Also, fragmentation within the eurosceptic party spectrum remains an issue: AD offered to cooperate with the euroscepticÂ Freie WÃ¤hlerÂ (free voters) during the state elections in Lower Saxony in January but theÂ Freie WÃ¤hlerÂ refused to agree. TheÂ Freie WÃ¤hlerÂ ended up with 0.5% in Lower Saxony. Money: The financial resources of the movement are scarce. Additional funding from economically powerful sources remains unlikely as long as the degree of internal fragmentation remains high. Content: As long as AD does not further carve out its position in other policy areas, campaigning on just one topic will remain a risky strategy that has not paid off in the past. Appeal: In contrast to other fragmented eurosceptic movements, the AD has some prominent supporters in its ranks. Most prominent supporters of the movement are highly professional media personalities as well as well-known eurosceptics like Hans-Olaf Henkel. Thus, a new eurosceptic party with prominent supporters could attract the mediaâ€™s attention as Angela Merkelâ€™s euro rescue politics remains a recurrent issue in German public debate and talk shows. Alternative still needs to officially register as a party and collect the requisite number of signatures to participate in elections come September. Moreover, Heinen says aside from the four factors above, much of Alternative's success will be determined by the public mood toward the euro crisis when September arrives â€“ will markets be flaring up, or will the environment seem largely benign?

Ever since the stock market rally began, there have been two schools of thought explaining this rally.Â  One school believes that the rally has been driven by improving fundamentals like rising corporate profits and an improving global economy.Â  The other more skeptical school believes that it has been driven by a dovish global central banks that have been pumping money into the financial markets. In a report published late last month, Morgan Stanley's Gerard Minack tackled the issue by offering two charts that sum up the entire debate The first chart correlates the stock market with the Fed's expanding balance sheet: Morgan Stanley The second correlates stock market valuations with economic surprises. Morgan Stanley Minack doesn't buy the argument that the Fed alone is driving markets.Â  He offers four reasons, which we summarize here: To borrow from UBS's Art Cashin, it seems the Occam's Razor-type explanation that markets have been driven by fundamentals is more likely. It's worth noting, however, that the two schools of thought don't have to be mutually exclusive.Â  Reformed Broker Josh Brown argues earnings are up because of the Fed's easy monetary policy: Because the Fed is not driving the stock market - it is driving the fundamentals that are driving the stock market. Once you make this distinction, it frees you up from a lot of the nonsense and conspiratorial scuttlebutt that passes for market commentary these days. The Fed's ZIRP policy is the most important driver of US earnings growth right now in my estimation which is what's behind the rally in share prices. Perhaps both schools are right.
WikimediaDuring his appearance on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street"this morning, Warren Buffett told famed hedge-fund manager Doug Kass he had won the contest to be the official market "bear" at Berkshire Hathaway's annual Omaha shareholder meeting in May. Buffett had put out a call for "credentialed bears" in his annual letter to shareholders Friday to help "spice things up" at the confab. It's quite a distinction. It's also somewhat surprising, because Kass earned the invite by letting Buffett know he has been short Berkshire stock for awhile.Â  In a post on Real Money, Kass explained how a humble email to CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick in advance of Buffett's interview won him the position.Â  I included in the email to Mr. Buffet my curriculum vitae and a column wrote in March 2008 that explained the rationale behind why I was short Berkshire's shares back then almost five years ago. (It turned out to be a successful short and, surprisingly, for the right reasons.) As well, I included references for Mr. Buffett of four hedge-hoggers and investment managers who were acquaintances of his, whom I knew he respected and were familiar with my body of work. Kass goes on to compare himself to the biblical Daniel trapped in the lion's den. But we're sure he'll do fine.
lev radin / Shutterstock.comMany CEOs carefully cultivate a quiet and considered public image, limiting contact to quarterly earnings calls or the occasional carefully-considered interview.Â  Then there are the others. The ones who make headlines with outbursts on politics, about their competitors, or even against an entire country's work ethic. At best, these incidents are distracting. At worst, they hurt a companies reputation and lose them customers. We identified the biggest loose cannons at major companies who can't seem to stay out of the news.Â  Â 
In 2012, the U.S. exported a $2.2 trillion worth of goods.  According to a new report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is an all-time high. This is also a huge improvement from 2011 when the U.S. exported $1.5 trillion worth of goods. Exports grew in 35 U.S. states, with 29 states setting new records for export sales, said the report. "Nationally, jobs supported by exports increased to 9.8 million in 2012," added the Commerce Department. So, anyone who says America doesn't make anything anymore is wrong. So who's buying all this stuff? Sales grew the most in countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. According to the report: Nationwide, 2012 U.S. merchandise exports to countries with which the United States has a trade agreement outpaced other markets nearly two to one. This included exports to: Oman (+22 percent); Panama (+20 percent); Costa Rica (+19 percent); Chile (+18 percent); Jordan (+18 percent); Colombia (+14 percent); Australia (+13 percent); Peru (+12 percent) and Mexico (+9 percent). Here's a map from the Commerce Department showing the destination of U.S. goods: U.S. Department of Commerce It's interesting to note that according to China's national customs bureau, China exported total of $2.05 trillion worth of goods during that same period.
He had some advice for Tim Cook: Ignore Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn. Einhorn recently filed â€” then dropped â€” a lawsuit against Apple; Einhorn wants Apple to create a preferred stock that pays a dividend in perpetuity. "I would ignore him," Buffet said. "I would run the business in such a manner as to create the most value over the next five to 10 years. You can't run a business to push the stock price up on a daily basis. Berkshire has gone down 50 percent four times in its history. When that happens, if you've got money you buy it. You just keep working on building the value." In other words, Cook should use Apple's massive pile of cash to buy back stock. He said he told Steve Jobs to do this, but Jobs didn't take the advice. "I did talk withÂ Steve JobsÂ a few years ago about what they might do with the cash. The best thing you can do with a business is run it well, and the shares will respond," Buffet said.Â  "When Steve called me, I said, 'Is your stock cheap?' He said, 'yes.' I said, 'Do you have more cash than you need?' He said, 'a little.' [laughs] I said, 'then buy back your stock.' He didn't ... But if you could buy dollar bills for 80 cents, it's a very good thing to do."
CNBCLast week Mike Mayo went head to head with Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan's investor day, arguing why investors might consider (say) UBS over JPM. Dimon got the better of him in that tiff, dominating with a quick zinger that the Street repeated for days — "That's why I'm richer than you." Today the infamously feisty Mayo got a chance to shake it off on CNBC's Squawk On The Street with Carlos Quintanilla. Mayo's bottom line: It's time for shareholders to start getting active. He's started buying 100 shares in companies that he'd like to see improve. The point, of course, is that he can get rowdy at investor day should he so choose. Citigroup, Mayo said, is his first priority right now. "I think the change of CEO at Citigroup could be epic," he said. A few words on his thesis for Citi and Quintanilla was on to the question on everyone's mind — Does having spats with CEOs make Mayo a better analyst? "I think it's the job of an analyst to hold management's feet to the fire, ask questions such as... how are you going to create more value for shareholders?," Mayo responded. "By all means that's my job that's every analysts job to do that. I don't think it's been done enough with regard to Wall Street. Look, when you look at the financial crisis, investors weren't doing their job, regulators weren't doing their job, nobody was minding the store. So we have a choice right now, either we investors can step up to the plate or you're going have more regulation. I prefer the former — that shareholders, me, other analyst like myself speak up...at annual meetings." Quintanilla then asked Mayo what analysts should do about getting stiff-armed by a company. "...If any analyst is getting stiff-armed or treated unfairly it's up to that anlayst to... bring it up to the public view, go on CNBC, give you a call. Hey, for that matter give me a call. If you're being treated unfairly by an organization, give me a call let's find a solution here because that's not the way it's supposed to work." Hear that analysts? Mike Mayo has your back.

The drop in personal income last week got some media attention, particularly given that it was the largest one-month drop in 20 years. USA Today: - Personal income growth plunged 3.6% in January, the biggest one-month drop in 20 years, the Commerce Department said Friday. And consumer spending rose just 0.2% with most of it going toward higher heating bills and filling up the gas tank. The income drop was offset by Americans' savings a hefty 2.6% rise in December. But most of that gain, analysts said, reflected a rush by companies to pay dividends and bonuses before income taxes increased on top earners at the start of 2013. There were spending declines in January for big-ticket items that last three years or more, like cars and appliances, and non-durable goods, like clothing and food. Some economists said the declines could be blamed on a 2% federal payroll tax cut expired Dec. 31.  Many immediately attributed this decline to the difference in dividend income. Companies who paid special dividend before the year-end generated an artificial one-time jump in personal dividend income in December. That made January look like a large decline on a month-over-month basis. It turns out the dividend was indeed a large portion of the "biggest one-month drop in 20 years". But as the chart below shows, it wasn't all of it.   Some have attributed a portion of January's decline directly to the increase in payroll tax and higher social security payments. However, if one adjusts for all the movements associated with "government social benefits" (payroll tax, social security, veterans benefits, etc.), the shape of the personal income trajectory remains relatively unchanged - in fact the decline in January looks worse.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that just as companies paid special dividends before the tax regime change, they also paid some bonuses and other distributions to employees (mostly executives) prior to the tax increases. Moreover, it's important to remember that in December it wasn't at all clear who exactly will pay higher taxes - the discussion initially was focused on $250K/year and then $400K/year and higher. That could have impacted a much larger group than the fiscal cliff compromise ultimately did. Since there is generally some flexibility around the timing of income recognition, some people tried to shift as much of it into 2012 as possible. And that generated the temporary spike in personal income that can't be explained by special dividends. When all the dust settles, the reality is that personal incomes are increasing at around 2% per year or less, just keeping up with the GDP growth. For now it's simply about muddling through, as near-term economic growth in the US is expected to remain subdued. USA Today: - "With tax hikes and spending cuts buffeting the economy, growth in the first half of the year is likely to be at a sub-2% pace," James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics wrote in a note. "At this pace, the unemployment will not improve and pressure will remain on the Federal Reserve to continue its asset purchase program."
Indeed, this was something of a hot topic in Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony before Congress last week. One of the big issues the central bank faces is the inevitable loss it will have to take when interest rates rise and the value of the Fed's bond portfolio declines. Although not an economic problem â€” as "losses"Â for a central bank are more of an accounting issueÂ â€” there could be a PR problem when theÂ Fed stops making payments to the Treasury from the interest income it receives on its bond portfolio. Deutsche Bank strategist Stephen Abrahams recently explained why this could be such a nightmare: The possibility of suspending remittances and carryingÂ unrealized lossesÂ could complicate the Fedâ€™s relationshipsÂ with the rest of Washington and the public.Â While remittances help the federal government pay down debt,Â any shortfall in operating income leading to a suspension of remittances would require the Fed to borrow from Treasury. And while unrealized losses have no effect on Fed operations because of the way government accounts for them,Â they would leave a private company technically insolvent. It is unclear how Washington and the public might react to these circumstancesÂ and whether theÂ Fedâ€™s independence might be challenged. The Fed appears already to be preparing for this problem.Â Below is the explanation Bernanke provided in his Congressional testimony: Another aspect of the Federal Reserve's policies that has been discussed is their implications for the federal budget. The Federal Reserve earns substantial interest on the assets it holds in its portfolio, and, other than the amount needed to fund our cost of operations, all net income is remitted to the Treasury. With the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, yearly remittances have roughly tripled in recent years, with payments to the Treasury totaling approximately $290 billion between 2009 and 2012.6 However, if the economy continues to strengthen, as we anticipate, and policy accommodation is accordingly reduced, these remittances would likely decline in coming years. Federal Reserve analysis shows that remittances to the Treasury could be quite low for a time in some scenarios, particularly if interest rates were to rise quickly.7 That's the bad news with regard to remittances. Bernanke goes on, though, in an attempt to mitigate it: However, even in such scenarios, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by the Federal Reserve's purchases will remain higher than the pre-crisis norm, perhaps substantially so. Moreover, to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury. This morning, in a new speech, Fed Vice-Chairman Janet Yellen devoted some space to the topic of remittances as well.Â Below is the key section from Yellen's speech in which she attempts to play down the effect of lower remittances: Focusing only on the ebb and flow of the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury, however, is not, in my view, the appropriate way to evaluate the effect of these purchases on the government's finances. More germane is the overall effect of the program on federal finances. If the purchases provide even a modest boost to economic activity, increased tax payments would swamp any reduction in remittances. By depressing longer-term interest rates, the purchases also hold down the Treasury's debt service costs. These effects can be quantified through simulations of the Board's FRB/US model. In the simulation I described earlier, a hypothetical program involving $500 billion of asset purchases would reduce the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product (GDP) by about 1.5 percentage points by late 2018. The lower debt-to-GDP ratio mainly reflects stronger tax revenue as a result of more-robust economic activity. It's becoming clear that Fed is becoming increasingly concerned about public perception, especially given all of the chatter about how the Fed is going to exit. Yellen and Bernanke are laying the groundwork, explaining why although the lack of remittances might not be great PR-wise, they're not technically problematic for any economic reasons.

Apple's stock continues to fade. It's down another 1.5% today. Part of the story here is well known: Steve Jobs is gone, there's no big blockbuster product on the horizon, and Android is a real threat to the iPhone. But there's a bigger story that's related to the overall market. Mark Dow tweeted this great chart comparing Apple to the gold miners over the last year. Bloomberg, Business Insider Says Dow: Not saying that $GDX (blue line) and $AAPL are similar behavioral phenomena...well, actually, I am. We wrote about something similar a couple of weeks ago. For years during the crisis, Apple was basically an asset class of its own (like gold). While other stocks were massively correlated, moving in tandem, Apple was ripping higher, divorced from market gravity. But with the sun rising, and the crisis panic fading, markets have become less correlated. And suddenly there's less demand for a unique asset that's shown itself to be untethered from everything else. So just as there's less need for gold in a world where there's more optimism and less panic, so too is there less need to own Apple. And so in addition to all of the product stuff, the Apple decline is also about macro-economics and the end of the panic.
OECD via QuartzIn urging would-be do-gooders to head to Wall StreetÂ in a recent article for Quartz, ethicist William MacAskill argues that by making a lot of money and then donating it, young people can actually do more to improve the world than by toiling in the low-paid vineyards of the non-profit sector: Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well. A lifetime salary of over $10 million is typical. Careers in nonprofits start at about $40,000, and donâ€™t typically exceed $100,000, even for executive directors. Over a lifetime, a typical salary is only about $2.5 million. By entering finance and donating 50% of your lifetime earnings, you could pay for two nonprofit workers in your placeâ€”while still living on double what you would have if youâ€™d chosen that route. Brooke Allenâ€™s riposte counters that any philanthropist/banker eager to â€œsave the worldâ€ would have to be sure that his contributions to charity arenâ€™t offset by damage he does while carrying out his day job. From our perspective, it also matters what kind of banking system our imaginary saintly bankers would be joining. If the system is dangerously large, the risks of doing damage to the economy would be higher, and perhaps they would have to up charitable contributions a bit more to offset the deleterious impact of participating in the banking system. This working paperÂ (pdf, p. 14) from the Bank for International Settlements hammers on the point that big banking systems can be bad for growth: There comes a point where further enlargement of the financial system can reduce real growth. Second, financial sector growth is found to be a drag on productivity growth. Our interpretation is that because the financial sector competes with the rest of the economy for scarce resources, financial booms are not, in general, growth-enhancing. This evidence, together with recent experience during the financial crisis, leads us to conclude that there is a pressing need to reassess the relationship of finance and real growth in modern economic systems. More finance is definitely not always better. Why is that? Arenâ€™t we told again and again that capital is the key to economic growth? To an extent, yes. But if there are too many bankers and too little real economy, it means thereâ€™s not enough quality business to go around. As a result, banks make a dash for the bottom, lending more to riskier borrowers, or operating on skimpier amounts of capital. (Or both!) Without enough capital, banks get jittery about declaring when loans go bad. So instead, they â€œevergreenâ€ them, pushing out the payback dates, which helps them look healthier but creates an unhealthy banking system and clogs up capital in struggling companies. In fairness, MacAskill isnâ€™t arguing that society needs more bankers. Heâ€™s just saying that those who do become bankers can do a lot of good if they give some of their pay to charity. Thatâ€™s true. But Allen is also right to point out that a banking systemâ€”even if itâ€™s populated with altruistic financiersâ€”can do its share of harm.
Tory Burch is a notable addition to the annual Forbes billionaire list.Â  The women's apparel company she started in 2004 is now worth an estimated $3.5 billion, making her 28.3 percent stake worth over $1 billion. Burch could be worth even more if the company decides to go public, something that many industry people speculate could happen now that her legal battle with ex-husband Chris Burch is over.Â  Tory Burch LLC brought in $800 million in revenues in 2012, according toÂ Forbes. By comparison, Michael Kors brought in $800 million in revenues in 2011, went public that year, and is now worth $10 billion.Â  Burch started her business in her kitchen 10 years ago. Today, she is famous for her Reva ballet flats, which are a staple among working women.Â  At 46, she's the second youngest self-made female billionaire. The youngest is Spanx founder Sara Blakely, 42.Â 
There's a brand new billionaire financier on the 2013 Forbes Billionaires list, a 53 year-old Hong Kong woman named Pollyanna Chu. Forbes' list puts together the richest people from all over the world and divides them by nationality, industry and age and more. Chu made the list as biggest shareholder and CEO of Kingston Financial, a brokerage firm. In 2010, Chu and her husband Nicholas decided to fold Kingston into another part of their family business, Golden Resorts, a hotel and casino company with properties in Macao including the Grandview Hotel and the Casa Real Hotel.  The couple started Kingston in 1993, after success in the real estate business in California. According to Forbes, Nicholas and Pollyanna both studied and met in the United States. It was Pollyanna's father who said they should look into setting something up in Hong Kong's newly booming market. From there it was all about building, even though Chu says she knew very little about finance when they started. To grow in Asia, Kingston focused on IPO distribution and mergers and acquisitions, becoming a top five firm for the latter in 2010. The Chu's decided to fold the private brokerage into the publicly traded Golden Resorts in hopes to expand internationally. That's how Kingston Financial Holdings came to be. Last year, Chu bought 75% of Sincere Watch, a distributor of Frank Muller watches in mainland China, and added that to her growing empire. She also has a 14.11% stake in a Premier League team, Birmingham City, according to The Daily Mail. Chu holds a B.A. in Management from Golden Gate University and an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy in Business Management from York University. She and her husband have one son named Kingston.

Some of the bearish calls we've heard on gold lately are closely tied to the outlook for real interest rates. The idea is that as real interest rates begin to normalize from ultra-low levels, gold will underperform. The inverse correlation between the price of gold and the interest rate on 5-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), for example, is fairly tight, as the chart below shows. Yet, when one examines the chart, as @Dutch_Book pointed out on Twitter, while the initial sell-off in gold that started in November correlated with a slight backup in real yields, it's definitely starting to appear overdone. Since then, gold has continued to tumble, even though real yields reversed course and kept heading lower. Bloomberg, Business Insider If the gold bears are expecting normalized real yields to keep sending gold lower, we'll have to start seeing some economic data that would actually cause real yields to normalize.

From Politico's Mike Allen in Playbook: MUST-SEE TV! Tonight on "Charlie Rose," a smackdown between Joe Scarborough and Paul Krugman. After arguing over the debt on their blogs, they're taking it to the airwaves, for the full hour. Tapes today on Charlie's legendary set at Bloomberg HQ in Manhattan. Airs 11 p.m. on WNET in NYC, and WETA and WHUT in D.C., and 200+ other PBS affiliates. Scarborough and Krugman have gone back and forth over the past month-plus over whether the deficit is as big deal as Scarborough says it is. In mid-February, Scarborough memorably dismissed Krugman and other like-minded pundits' usage of charts as something that "liberals make up on their mom's PowerPoint." Scarborough also called Krugman as extreme on the deficit as the NRA's Wayne LaPierre is on guns. One of the problems with Scarborough's argument, as Krugman and others have noted, is that none of the important people who agree with Scarborough are mainstream economists. (H/T Dylan Byers)

Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen is the favorite to replace Ben Bernanke, and she's just delivered a speech in DC titled Challenges Confronting Monetary Policy. The whole speech is worth reading, but pretty much this is the most important line: Turning to the potential costs of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases, there are some that definitely need to be monitored over time. At this stage, I do not see any that would cause me to advocate a curtailment of our purchase program. This echoes the same sentiment expressed by Bernanke, himself, in a speech from Friday, wherein he said: In light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price stability, and, ultimately, financial stability. Indeed, as I noted, a premature removal of accommodation could, by slowing the economy, perversely serve to extend the period of low long-term rates.
APMarch 2 (Reuters) - Las Vegas Sands Corp said it "likely" violated the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws the bribery of foreign officials, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday. The filing marks the first disclosure by the casino operator, controlled by founder and billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, that is was under investigation. The SEC subpoenaed company documents in February 2011 relating to its compliance with the antibribery act while the U.S. Department of Justice also advised Sands it was conducting an investigation, the company said in its annual report filing. "There were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA," the company said. Sands spokesman Ron Reese said on Saturday he had no additional comment beyond the SEC filing. Reuters reported exclusively in August that Sands allowed a man identified by the U.S. Senate as an organized crime figure to move a $100,000 gambling credit from a Las Vegas casino to one of its Macau casinos. The company's findings are related to deals in mainland China led by executives no longer employed at Sands, the Wall Street Journal reported, sourcing a person familiar with the matter. Sands, in the filing, said the issue would have no material impact on the company's financial records and that it would not need to restate any past financial statements.

The resurgence of US auto sales is one of the big stories of the recovery. In February, auto makers sold light vehicles at a 15.4 million unit annualized rate. This chart is from Calculated Risk. Calculated Risk How high can it go? A new note from Citi's Itay Michaeli says it can easily get to 16-17 million. His note is titled: 11.8 Million Reasons to Be Bullish on SAAR. Michaeli says that despite the big surge in car sales, we're still seeing below-average fleet scrapage. There's a lot of pent-up demand. If Someone Asked You â€” In 2012, U.S. auto sales rose a robust 13% to 14.4 million. The popular explanation was that an aging fleet was finally releasing pent-up demand. Subscribing to this explanation, one would think that the U.S. scrap rate must have surely gone up last year, right? Wrong. According to fresh Polk data, the U.S. apparently scrapped only 4.7% of light vehicles last year (11.8mln), down from 5.0% the prior year (5.2% avg. since â€˜02). So why did auto sales rise? Because of the very improvement in vehicle density that our Sep-11 density survey originally predicted (â€œDo They Want to Drive?â€). In other words, for the first time since 2007, the U.S. vehicle population managed to grow by 1.0%, which is more in-line with the driver population. So What Does This Mean? â€” Vehicles continued to age last year (now 11.4yrs old) despite a â€œstrongâ€ SAAR, meaning that investors likely havenâ€™t missed the pent-up demand cycleâ€”in fact it doesnâ€™t appear like itâ€™s even begun. This may be very good news for the U.S. auto cycle, so long, of course, as vehicle density doesnâ€™t spoil the party again (our survey closely tracks the 2yr density outlook, next survey due out in May). But with &gt;251 million light vehicles on the road, returning to a mid-5% scrap (avg. 2002-08) + ~1% population growth easily gets us to a 16-17 million SAAR.

My real expertise is in portfolio construction and understanding the world of saving/investing.  And as I’ve evolved and matured during my career I’ve been forced to become comfortable with one truth: You will be wrong in this business.  A LOT.   That’s just a simple reality.  But those who tend to succeed in this business versus those who don’t tend to be the ones who learn from their mistakes and accept that being wrong is inevitable and therefore build a plan around this reality. I’ve been through an interesting transition in the last 5 years where I was forced to alter many of my market strategies to confront the reality of unprecedented government interaction and a changing macro landscape.  So I became more of a macro expert than a micro expert on many things.  And that required a vastly different view of the world.  And in learning that view of the world I was forced to realize that I knew a lot less about macroeconomics than I needed to.   The road to developing Monetary Realism has been fraught with lessons, some mistakes and a maturation process.  Most importantly, it involved me understanding how wrong I was about many things. In the past, I’ve said “it’s only in being wrong that we can learn to be right”.  So I loved this piece I saw over at Josh Brown’s site on how our need to be right can often be our biggest downfall (via Harvard): “All are harmful because they prevent the honest and productive sharing of information and opinion. But, as a consultant who has spent decades working with executives on their communication skills, I can tell you that the fight response is by far the most damaging to work relationships. It is also, unfortunately, the most common. That’s partly due to another neurochemical process. When you argue and win, your brain floods with different hormones: adrenaline and dopamine, which makes you feel good, dominant, even invincible. It’s a the feeling any of us would want to replicate. So the next time we’re in a tense situation, we fight again. We get addicted to being right.” I wish more of our leaders, co-workers and neighbors would open their minds to this simple truth.  You will be wrong about many things in life.  And it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to confirm all of your biases.  But what if we all started to recognize that improvement often starts with understanding how to be wrong?   Imagine how much more we’d all get accomplished.  I say embrace being wrong.  And more importantly, be open-minded enough to learn and adapt around being wrong so you can be right more often.
Could the Italian elections precipitate a return to the intense days of the European sovereign debt crisis? Morgan Stanley -- which places 30% odds on a new election -- offers this nice chart which serves as a potential guide to danger. This shows the "OMT Range" on Italian sovereign debt in the red horizontal lines. In other words, ever since the European Central Bank announced its plan to backstop government debt, Italian borrowing costs have been in the range enveloped by those lines. Only if Italian borrowing costs (or costs relative to German borrowing costs) shoot above the top red line should you be worried that the imputed backstop is starting to weaken. Morgan Stanley
Asher B. DurandIt should be a very big week for the economy and world markets. A few reasons for that. First, there's lots of data. As you can see on this calendar, we'll be getting Services ISM, the ADP Jobs Report, Consumer Credit, Non-Farm Payrolls, The Trade Balance, and the Fed Beige Book. Then beyond that, it's a huge week for central banks. From Michael McDonough, among the central banks that will act this week are: The ECB, The Bank of Japan, the Bank of Indonesia, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Bank of England. Beyond that, it should be big in terms of budget politics in the US and parliamentary politics in Italy, both of which have the potential to move markets. Also, watch for headlines out of China's National People's Congress, which is in session.
Joe Weisenthal, Business InsiderA quick take on Italy from Morgan Stanley, which sees a 30% chance of a return to crisis and elections. Our base case is that Italy is able to form an (albeit weak) government, keeping our economics and strategy base case at ‘eurozone crisis contained, not resolved’. We assign a 30% probability that the ‘Crisis’ stage of the CRIC cycle returns, although with less intensity than in 2011 or 2012. Italian political risk scenarios: We assign a subjective 70% probability that another round of elections can be avoided in Italy, but only a 10% probability that such a government will be strong and stable. We assign a 30% probability to our bear case that no viable government can be formed, and new elections are needed. We caution that the situation remains fluid. Italy's elections are definitely still top of mind for many investors, even though many markets outside of Italy have forgotten the events of exactly one week ago.

Italy -- which you must remember has the largest stock of outstanding government debt in the Eurozone -- is getting pasted again. Yields are ticking higher, and the stock market is off over 1.3%. Key developments of the weekend: As SocGen's Kit Juckes notes in his morning note, there's been no progress in forming a government. Still each party says that they won't work with each other. There were some headlines over the weekend about the prospect of new election soon. Here's a snapshot of Italy's FTSE MIB stock index. FTSEMIB
flickr/sadjinaRISK OFF. Markets are generally lower around the world following a brutal day in Shanghai. The Shanghai Composite stock index fell 3.6%. The decline was lead by the Shanghai Property Index, which fell 9.25%, after new measures were introduced to curb the rise in property prices. This had rippled effects, including a dive in the Aussie dollar, and a 1.5% loss in the Australian stock market. Europe is down as well. Italy still is seeing no progress on government formation, so the FTSE MIB index (Milan stock market) is down 1.37%. Germany is down 0.6%. Italian borrowing costs are ticking higher. In the meantime, US futures are up as well. For more on the big dive in Chinese property stocks, see here &gt;
China's property stocks are selling off today on news of new efforts to contain the hot Chinese property market. Some expert praise China's efforts to actively contain what many think is an asset bubble. But according to a new 60 Minutes report, China's regulators may already be too late. You see, China's economic growth has brought riches to the middle class. But that middle class cannot invest abroad and bank returns are paltry. And the Chinese have been turned off by their extremely volatile stock market.  Just look at today's massive today's sell-off, and you can see why. With nowhere else to put their money, the Chinese have been shoveling their money into real estate, which has fueled a massive building boom. The problem is no one is moving into many of these new properties. Yet with prices only going up, the investment dollars continue to pour in. This echoes of the U.S. experience.  Americans scarred by the bursting tech bubble shunned stocks and headed toward the real estate market where it seemed prices would only go up. And the experts 60 Minutes' Leslie Stalhl spoke to think this will end badly like it did in the U.S. in 2007 and the years after. "There are multiple classes of people who are going to get wiped out by this," said Gillem Tulloch, a Hong Kong based analyst.  "People who have invested three generations worth of savings -- grandparents', parents', and children into properties -- will see their savings evaporate.  And then of course there is 50 million construction workers who are working on all of these projects around China." Anne Stevenson-Yang of J Capital Research shared this sentiment while laying out the doomsday scenario. "Everybody wakes up one day and they find out their money's gone, and their apartments are worthless," said Stevenson-Yang.  "That's the doomsday." An imploding Chinese property market has the potential to have major global implications. Stevenson-Yang warns this could evolve into a debt crisis, which could freeze up the Chinese credit markets. This is problematic for people outside of China because China is the world's second largest economy and arguably the world's most important source of growth. Only time will tell if things unfold like the doomers suggest.  Unfortunately, the doomsday scenario is exactly what happened in the U.S. And China appears to be following the same path.
CNBCA wave of new money coming into equity markets is a "powerful force" to reckon with and means that risks such as the U.S. budget cuts and uncertainty in Italy are unlikely to derail a stellar rally in the markets, one expert told CNBC. While there has been much talk of a "Great Rotation," a shift by long-term funds into equities from bonds amid improving sentiment, the real driving force behind recent gains in equities has been an inflow of new money that was previously held in cash, said Laura Fitzsimmons, vice president for futures and options at JPMorgan Investment Bank. (Read More: Why Talk of a 'Great Rotation' May Be Overblown) She said the shift suggests markets would be able to weather headwinds such as concerns about the impact of the U.S. "sequester" - $85 billion worth of spending cuts that took effect on Friday after lawmakers in Washington failed to agree to an alternative budget plan. "There's definitely been an underlying shift in markets," she told CNBC's Asia "Squawk Box." "People talk about a 'Great Rotation,' but actually I think it's just new money that's coming into the market that had been sitting in cash and that's a pretty powerful force to be reckoned with." U.S. stocks shrugged off the looming spending cuts to close higher on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a fresh five-year high. Equity markets globally have also bounced back after inconclusive election results in Italy last week dealt risk appetite a blow, with European shares closing on Friday almost 2 percent above eight-week lows hit earlier in the week. (Read More: Dow Likely to Bust Through Record – Then What?) "I think equities look over-stretched and I'm not alone in that view. But when you talk to real money investors that went long at the start of the year, they still feel reasonably comfortable with their positions," Fitzsimmons said. "They feel that we have weathered the storm so far. We've had the Italian elections, the 'sequester' – there are lots of issues out there - but we're not seeing the real pullback you might have expected given trading conditions in previous years," she added. Jason Hughes, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said it was still too early to say how the U.S. "sequester" would impact risk appetite in the weeks ahead. (Read More: Obama on Sequester: No Apocalypse, 'Just Dumb') "Now that we have tipped over the 'sequester' there is more of a risk for markets, but it's true that the search for higher returns means that there is limited downside for equities," he said. Fitzsimmons said although she expected a pullback in the S&amp;P 500 below the 1,500 level, a significant retreat was unlikely while investors' risk appetite remained largely intact. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 1,518 on Friday. It has rallied about 6.5 percent so far this year on the back of brighter U.S. economic data, a better outlook for China's economy and generally improved sentiment in the euro zone. "I'm not looking for a big pullback because dips will always be supported in this environment until we get a real risk off mood. And I can't exactly see where that is coming from at this point," Fitzsimmons said.
The Shanghai Composite is down 2.9 percent, with the decline being led by property stocks.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is down 1.3 percent. Australian stocks are taking a hit, and most Asian markets are down. The Nikkei however is up 0.3 percent after comments from Haruhiko Kuroda, whom prime minister Shinzo Abe has nominated as the next Bank of Japan governor..
