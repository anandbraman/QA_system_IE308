Australian companies added a whopping 71.5k jobs in February, the biggest monthly gain since July 2000. Economists were looking for an addition of just 10k jobs. The unemployment rate held at 5.4 percent as more people returned to the workforce. The mining heavy economy has struggled to find growth as its major export partners slowed. Here's a looked at the move in the Aussie dollar before and after the jobs report. Finviz
At an event in New York tonight, economists, investors, and economics publishers debated the question of whether the US needed a policy of a "strong" dollar. On the one side were two known hard money fans: Steve Forbes and Jim Grant, who both favor a gold standard. On the other side were economist Frederic Mishkin and hedge funder John Taylor. Anyway, it sounds like the gold bugs got their clocks cleaned. Bloomberg's Michael McKee tweeted up a storm. Mishkin cites Anna Schwartz research showing slower growth slower under gold. Grant not impressed by Anna Schwartz. @iq2us #strongdollar Forbes then gets history wrong: says going off gold standard in 1930s didn't work. In fact, strong growth followed. @iq2us #strongdollar Mishkin to Grant: no serious scholar disagrees there was more volatility under classic gold standard... @iq2us #strongdollar Grant: there's no linear improvement in monetary policy. We've gone backward into dark ages. @iq2us #strongdollar Grant cites "Little House on the Prairie" anecdote to counter Mishkin's Anna Schwartz research. @iq2us #strongdollar Sort of not sorry #strongdollar debate is over. Was hoping for more facts from Forbes/Grant. Actually, would have liked any facts. @iq2us Audience vote: Mishkin/Taylor win easily. Though neither side really supported a "strong" dollar. @iq2us #strongdollar
Reporting from Santiago, Chile There is no such thing as a ‚Äògood‚Äô fiat currency.  Any model in which a tiny banking elite wields dictatorial control over a nation‚Äôs unbacked paper money supply is deeply flawed. The concept itself is dangerous, and comparing fiat currencies is like debating which is the ‚Äòleast harmful‚Äô poison. That being said, the world is not yet at a stage where you can walk into a Starbucks and pay for a few lattes with a quarter ounce of silver. Society still functions on paper currency, and if you want to engage in commerce, you have to pick one. We‚Äôve frequently mentioned several currencies in this column which are better options, i.e. ‚Äòless ugly‚Äô, than the others. The Hong Kong dollar is one example. It‚Äôs pegged to the US dollar in a very narrow band, so you‚Äôre not taking any risk of it fluctuating. And if the world experiences a deflationary spiral, both the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar will surge‚Ä¶ so you‚Äôll be protected. Yet if the US dollar continues its path to irrelevance, the Hong Kong authorities will likely re-adjust the peg, giving you an instant nominal appreciation. The Singapore dollar is another option which have been steadily appreciating against other major currencies, backed by a strong economy and a government with zero net debt. We‚Äôve also talked about the Chilean peso. Like Singapore, Chile has a booming economy with minimal net debt. And the peso has been one of the best performing currencies in the world. But what most people don‚Äôt know is that there‚Äôs another ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô in Chile. It‚Äôs called Unidad de Fomento, or UF. To be clear, UF isn‚Äôt an actual currency. There are no UF bills and coins. But you can open a savings account here denominated in UF, and it‚Äôs freely interchangeable to pesos. Why would someone do this? Because UF is a store of value. It constantly adjusts with inflation. In other words, one UF today will buy you as many loaves of bread and gallons of gasoline that it bought five, ten, fifteen years ago. This way, you can ensure that the purchasing power of your savings is preserved. And if you have a UF bank account, you can even generate an inflation-adjusted return on top of that. This is a really innovative idea born from Chile‚Äôs own experience with hyperinflation several decades ago. And as I have traveled to over 100 countries, I have seen this concept in very, very few places. Of course, few banks in the world outside of Chile offer Chilean peso or UF-denominated accounts; and establishing a bank account in Chile is incredibly difficult. Like many things in this country, banking is very relationship-based. I liken the Chilean banking system to a private club. It‚Äôs closed to outsiders, and it‚Äôs very difficult to gain entry. But once you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in‚Ä¶ especially if you have a great relationship with your account executive. I‚Äôm pleased to say that I‚Äôve made very special arrangements for the folks coming to our sold-out Offshore Tactics Workshop in Chile at the end of this month. Attendees will be able to open local accounts, denominated in pesos or UF. Even though the event is sold out, though, you can realize the same benefits with our at-home video kit. The video kit is available for pre-order until tomorrow night at a very special price; click here to claim yours now. Read more posts on Sovereign Man ¬ª
 REUTERS/Edgard GarridoThe Dow has made brand new highs for 9 straight trading days. And rather than make people nervous, it seems to be sucking in even more bulls, creating even more optimism. In a new note out this evening, Citi macro strategist Jeremy Hale unveils a series of new trades, several of which can be characterized as: GO AMERICA. Here are some of the big ones, with our summary of his rationale in bullets: Sell US Treasuries Long the dollar vs. G10 currencies ¬†Go long US equities vs. corporate credit There's no doubt that the bulls are on parade. This comes after Morgan Stanley's big call about an "inflection point" for the US economy. Heck, even Richard Russell is a bull. There's a feeling that (and this is especially so after today's retail sales report) that the US economy is bulletproof, the Fed isn't going to screw it up, and things won't be too bad in Washington, beyond what everyone expected. Risk on.
One of our most favorite economic indicators to follow is South Korean exports. It's a favorite of Jim O'Neill.† Goldman Sachs and UBS both literally refer to it as a "canary in the coalmine" for the economy. Korean trade data†usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. Because Korea's exports are heavily exposed to China and Japan ó the world's second and third largest economies ó it is consider to have strong predictive power. In addition to being an early report, it's also a leading indicator for world trade. Below is a chart from a new report from Morgan Stanley's Joachim Fels. It shows how Korean exports are a leading indicator for global trade. Assuming its predictive powers hold, it would appear that global growth has bottomed. Morgan Stanley
Morgan StanleyOptimism for the U.S. economy has been coming back in a big way as the surprisingly positive data flows in. Yesterday, Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart published a big report titled "US Economics: An Inflection Point Ahead." "The severe financial crisis of 2008-09 necessitated significant downward adjustments by the private sector to the levels of aggregate demand and efficient supply," he wrote. "As the event recedes further into history, however, the drag on growth from these ongoing level adjustments plays out." Reinhart expects to the economy to accelerate in a major way within the next few months. "In the Morgan Stanley forecast for the US, the trajectory of economic activity marks an inflection point midway through 2013," he wrote. "Economic activity is currently held down by fiscal consolidation. However, the expansion of real GDP steps up to around 2-3/4 percent in the second half of this year and beyond." In a 22-slide presentation accompanying the report, Morgan Stanley's U.S. economics team points to an array of bright spots including the rebounding housing market, the resilient consumer, and the improving labor market. They also point to major issues that will continue to hinder growth.† However, the overall message is an extremely positive one. NOTE: Thanks to Morgan Stanley for allowing us to feature Mr. Reinhart's presentation.
Senate Democrats unveiled their first budget resolution in four years on Wednesday, a plan that includes nearly $1 trillion each in new tax hikes and spending reductions over the next decade. The budget, which was introduced Wednesday by†Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), stands in sharp contrast to the one unveiled Tuesday by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Here are some of the details in the Senate budget: ìOur budget is built on three principles," Murray said in opening remarks at the Senate Committee Budget markup of the budget on Wednesday. "Number one, we need to protect our fragile economic recovery, create jobs, and invest in long-term growth. Number two, we need to tackle our deficit and debt fairly and responsibly. And number three, we need to keep the promises weíve made as a nation to our seniors, our families, and our communities." In a statement, the White House praised the budget, saying it met President Barack Obama's test of balanced deficit reduction. "This budget makes tough spending cuts and leaves no sacred cows, but it also makes sure that seniors and the middle class arenít forced to bear the full burden of deficit reduction by eliminating wasteful loopholes through tax reform, †so that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share," White House press secretary Jay Carney said.

Last week, JCPenney took a hit when board member Steve Roth's Vornado Realty Trust decided to try to dump 10 million shares ó 40 percent of its stake. JCPenney CFO Ken Hannah spoke at Bank of America's 2013 Consumer &amp; Retail Conference today and he revealed what happened in the days before and after Roth made the move. The company had a board meeting in the days leading up to its Q4 earnings release on February 27. Hannah didn't see any change in Roth's demeanor during that meeting. "Steve was as supportive and as constructive in that board meeting than he has ever been," said Hannah.†"I can tell you that there was not one indication coming out of that meeting that he was going to do anything with his position." "There was not one discussion following our board meeting that there had been anything that changed with Steve," said Hannah, who noted that he's not speaking for Roth. "He did what he felt he needed to do." Hannah said that Roth likely "concluded that it just wasn't worth the effort." Vornado's CEO stepped down later that week, then Roth gave the go-ahead to try to dump the shares that weekend. "His investment in JCP is less than 1 percent of a $25 billion enterprise value. So my guess is with him taking over the CEO responsibility, he didn't want the distraction," said Hannah, who noted that it took up "a third of the time" on Roth's most recent earnings call.  Roth was seen as a big ally of activist investor Bill Ackman at the retailer. They were both elected to the board at the same time. Vornado has 13.4 million shares left. or a 6.11 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.Forget Market Timing, Focus On Risk Analysis (The Big Picture) Market timing isn't easy and investors should instead work on risk analysis, according to Barry Ritholtz. "The data overwhelmingly shows that no one is ever going to make a risk assessment that allows them to top tick on the way out going to 100% cash at the highs and bottom tick at the bottom, going all in." Instead Ritholtz says investors should try to 1. Identify trends in the market 2. Watch if earnings are rising or falling 3. Figure out whether stocks and cheap or expensive 4. Are interest rates going up or down 5. Identify what the corrections mean for your portfolio 6. Better grasp market volatility and risk viz-a-viz opportunities 7.

Banks Are Trying To Sell Structured Products To A Broader Market (The Wall Street Journal) Traditionally only the very wealthy and institutions bought structured products that the Wall Street Journal defines as "complex and opaque investments packaged by investment banks based on derivatives, such as options, indexes, commodities or swaps." Banks are now trying to make these products, that are being closely watched by Finra, available to independent advisors as well. While some tout these products because of the gains they can bring, others warn that they can be expensive, carry a lot of risk, and are difficult for clients to understand.¬†  Households, Not Hedge Funds, Really Own The Stock Market (Goldman Sachs) "Households directly own 38 percent of the U.S. equity market," according to Goldman Sachs' David Kostin. When you take into account mutual funds, pension funds and insurance policy holdings however that number goes up to about 80 percent. Hedge funds it turns out only own about 3 percent. Goldman Sachs How Bill Ackman Constructs His Portfolio (Advisor Perspectives) In an interview with Advisor Perspectives, legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said his active investments have offered him higher returns. He also described how he constructs his portfolio. "We think having 8 to 12 core positions at a time provides an adequate degree of diversification, while allowing us to concentrate in a handful of ideas that we know very well and believe have highly favorable risk/reward characteristics. If our capital base were permanent, we‚Äôd probably only do active investments. But it isn‚Äôt, so the fact that I don‚Äôt ever want to be forced to sell an active investment in the course of an engagement means we also need to hold passive positions. Historically, around 55% of our portfolio has been in active investments, 15% or so has been in cash, and the balance has been passive."Howard Marks Tells Us How To Invest In Uncertain Times (Oaktree Capital) Howard Marks says the world is a more uncertain place today that in "any time in my experience." In a presentation he points out "black swans, landmines and long-term problems," and based on these he puts together an investment blueprint in which he tells investors to tread with caution. In his section titled "prescription for an uncertain world", Marks tells investors to 1. Moderate their expectations 2. "Emphasize corporate investments" 3. "Commit to active decision making" even if it is choosing to do nothing 4. "Remember the reasons for caution aren't imaginary" and 5. "Balance the pros and cons".¬† 
A post on deflation in Sweden (which its central bank does not want) got me to thinking about inflation targeting once again.  Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, has an inflation target† of† "2 per cent as measured by CPI." Bernanke has a similar target, as do many central banks.  The first major problem with inflation targeting is that increases in money supply and credit (the true measure of inflation) frequently appear in the form of asset bubbles, not consumer prices. Even if that were not the case, it's easy to show why 2% inflation targeting is a bad thing. † † Inflation Targeting at 2% a YearMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis Real Disposable IncomeMish's Global Economic Trend AnalysisReal Disposable Income Per CapitaMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis Real Disposable Income Per Capita DetailMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis As long as wages and income keep up with inflation targeting, and as long as asset bubbles do not form, central banks can get away with their highway robbery tactics. At some point however, asset bubbles do form and that's where big problems start. The Fed has sponsored three major bubbles in recent history.Three Major Fed-Sponsored Bubbles   In the wake of the dot-com bust, the Fed (via loose monetary policy) sponsored a housing and credit bubble that caused the global financial crisis. The Fed did not see the housing bubble partially because prices are not in the CPI, but primarily because Bernanke and Greenspan have the common sense of a rock. Following the housing/credit bubble bust, the Fed's "too big to fail" policy bailed out the banks at taxpayer expense. The Fed's subsequent QE to infinity policy created yet another stock major bubble that few see (simply because it has not yet burst). All the while, price inflation marches on, even if credit inflation does not (roughly the current state of affairs). Thus, in addition to the asset bubble problem, the second sad moral of this story is simple: Pursue price inflation long enough, then jobs move elsewhere and real wages are guaranteed to not keep up. Starting in a major way in the year 2000, jobs and capital moved overseas because US wages were uncompetitive globally. Let's not stop there because it gets even worse. Income Gap Discussion In addition to the "Income Gap" one must also consider "Income Skew".  Under the Fed's inflationary policies, a select few percent have done exceptionally well, another few percent have done well, and another (perhaps slightly larger group) have barely kept up.  The bottom 80 percent or so have fallen much further behind than the above per capita charts suggest.Income Skew I explained why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer in Top 1% Received 121% of Income Gains During the Recovery, Bottom 99% Lose .4%; How, Why, Solutions In response to that article a Reader Asked Me to Prove "Inflation Benefits the Wealthy" (At the Expense of Everyone Else)CPI Percent Change From Year AgoMish's Global Economic Trend Analysisclick on any chart for sharper image Except for a brief period in 2009, price inflation has been positive. The question is "Who Benefited?" I claim it is those with "first access to money" namely banks and the already wealthy. A few charts courtesy of Doug Short at Advisor Perspectives will prove my point.Real US Household IncomesMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis In "real" (CPI-adjusted) terms, 50% of households are no better off than they were in 1988. Let's dig a litter deeper.Growth in Real Household Income by QuintileMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis The above chart shows percentage income growth by quintile since 1967. Since 1988, the bottom, 4th and middle quintiles (a combined 60% of households) have negative real income growth. The next chart shows the same thing in a different way.Real Household Income by QuintileMish's Global Economic Trend Analysis No matter what your timeframe, only the top quintile did well. And from 1980 until 2000 the top 5% got the lion's share of income gains.Inflation is Theft  Inflation is an insidious hidden tax that benefits those with first access to money (the banks and the already wealthy), and government (via sales taxes, property taxes, and income taxes).  Government bureaucrats take your money and redistribute it primarily for wasteful pet projects in their districts or to those who contribute to the politicians' campaigns.  In spite of the often-heard mantra that "inflation wipes away debt", I suggest otherwise. Income typically does not keep up with expenses, and most have too few assets to inflate. The poor (last on the credit totem pole) overpay for their assets with cheap credit given to them at precisely the wrong times (as happened right before the housing bust). Inflation Clobbers Those on Fixed Income In case you missed it, please consider Hello Ben Bernanke, Meet "Stephanie", my response to a reader on fixed income attempting to live on Social Security plus interest on a $16,000 CD.  If routine price inflation did not benefit the banks and the wealthy at the expense of everyone else, we probably would not have it.Simple Solution (Easier Said than Done)  Conceptually, the way to eliminate the problem is simple: abolish the Fed and get rid of fractional reserve lending. In practice, the idea is easier said than done, because the wealthy are in control of the system and they are the ones who benefit from inflation.

A common theme in the private equity world as asset prices have risen is the apparent lack of opportunities to find good value in new investments. Now, Goldman Sachs analysts are warning clients invested in big, publicly-traded alternative asset managers about a "private equity cliff," and they say the big fees that fund managers collect from investors are at risk. The chart below shows the "cliff" Goldman is talking about. Goldman Sachs Research The dark blue bars on top show the billions of dollars in capital that have been raised by private equity fund managers since 2010. Goldman estimates that total funds raised and deployed in 2013 will hit $45 billion, up from $37 billion in 2013. However, the dark blue bars show that capital from previous private equity investments ‚Äì which has benefitted from rising asset prices ‚Äì is being returned to shareholders faster than funds can raise new money. In other words, assets under management are shrinking, which means fees derived from management of that capital will shrink as well. "As more invested capital is pulled out of¬†the ground, we see risk to fee-paying AuM and potential for choppiness in fee-related earnings," writes Goldman analyst Marc Irizarry. While private equity fundraising is on the rebound, it's nowhere near pre-crisis levels, when the capital that is now being returned to investors was initially raised, as the chart below illustrates. Preqin, Goldman Sachs Research And even though fundraising is nowhere near pre-crisis levels, that hasn't restrained the rapid growth in the number of funds trying to raise money in recent years. As the next chart shows, the number of private equity and real estate funds trying to raise money these days is up 25 percent from 2010. Preqin, Goldman Sachs Research Put these three things together, and you have the recipe for a shrinking private equity market. "Amid higher markets and higher valuations, we expect managers to be more selective, deploying capital at a more measured pace," writes Irizarry. "Commentary from credit investors such as OAK‚Äôs Howard Marks and FIG‚Äôs Pete Briger suggests to us opportunities to deploy capital at reasonable valuations are scarcer, and accordingly, disciplined managers are raising relatively smaller funds (e.g., OAK‚Äôs $5 bn Fund IX) and delaying their investment periods." So, what are private equity firms trying to do in order to mitigate this "cliff"? First, firms are launching smaller, more targeted funds. "Our¬†comparison of invested funds (i.e., ‚Äúolder‚Äù funds) and funds currently in their investment period shows sub-$3 billion funds are¬†increasingly common (now 46% of committed capital vs. 29% previously)," says Irizarry. Second, firms are seeking "more permanent sources of capital" than the typical private equity investor, writes Irizarry: Permanent capital vehicles and insurance partnerships provide non-traditional solutions to the ‚Äúcliff.‚Äù FIG has highlighted the potential of permanent capital (REITs, BDC‚Äôs) to bolster management fees, kicking off 2013 by raising $764 mn of new equity for Newcastle, adding to fee-paying AuM in PE. The firm aims to raise at least $5 bn in other vehicles that would likely accompany and co-invest with sector-specific funds such as WWTAI or a senior housing or nonperforming loan fund. Meanwhile APO now manages nearly $16 bn for Athene, a re-insurer and partner of APO. Athene is growing significantly via acquisitions such as Presidential Life ($4 bn of assets) and Aviva (expected to add $35 bn to the platform if it closes). APO benefits in two ways: 1) an asset allocation fee on all $16 bn of Athene Asset Management‚Äôs AuM and 2) management and performance fees for the approximately 1/3 of AuM that is managed in APO credit funds. We expect other managers to leverage this channel more given an estimated $1 tn insurance outsourcing opportunity (as per industry sources). Finally, Irizarry says, bigger funds are investing in smaller funds in order to capture "hidden fee-related earnings." Irizarry cites, for example, Oaktree's investment in DoubleLine. "This AuM is not necessarily consolidated into the firm‚Äôs total AuM, but¬†does provide another source of cash earnings and helps diversify the businesses," Irizarry says. The investment landscape is changing, and private equity firms are adjusting. If they don't, they stand to lose out on those fees the industry loves so much.

Beijingís Rising Rents Squeeze Newcomers Barred From Home Buying - Bloomberg The Chinese capital requires new arrivals to wait five years before purchasing a house, while cities including Shanghai permit ownership after one year of residency. Beijing introduced restrictions on non-locals in 2011, followed by about 40 other cities, part of a three-year, largely unsuccessful campaign by the central government to contain the growth of property prices. Average rents in the capital have jumped 23 percent since 2010, while demand for rentals surged 82 percent as migrant workers and graduates poured into the city, according to data from broker Bacic &amp; 5i5j Group.

Screengrab Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina has been named new pope. Bergolio, who is of Italian descent, is currently the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. His new name will be Pope Francis. The announcement is definitely a surprise, last we saw he was getting odds of 33/1 on Paddy Power. For one thing, he's 76 years old ó considerably older than many of the other candidates, and many had thought that the papal conclave would favor a younger candidate given Pope Benedict XVI's early resignation. However, he is the first pope from the "New World," and the first from Latin America ó an important change given that 40 percent of Catholics currently live there. Bergoglio has spent almost his entire life in Argentina, the AP notes.

AP ImagesQ: A question for debate:  We all seem to get mad that the financial-industrial complex is repeatedly rigged for the Big Boys.† Iíd suggest to you that the public should just give up on the wall street-banker/big bank/mutual fund industry as having any possibility of being fair to you or me.† Thus, it makes no sense to be mad at it.† Instead, people should invest the way their grandparents did: bonds, cash savings in a local bank or a hole in your backyard, real property, and (if theyíre savvy enough) businesses or stocks that they understand.† ñMichael G., San Antonio, TX † This is a really good question for debate, Michael, and I agree with some of the spirit of it.† I suspect millions of people have had a version of this thought, wondering if theyíre the suckers at a rigged game and whether itís time to take their marbles and go home ñ to bury their savings in the back yard or the local bank.† But while Iím sympathetic with the question, I disagree on the actionable consequences of your view. I particularly like your suggestion, paralleling Michael Pollanís food movement of the last few years,[1] to do only what your grandparents would recognize as investing.† Thereís virtue in simplicity, and you could not go too far wrong that way.† Many of us have an imaginary Amish pastoral scene in mind as a balm on a particularly confusing day. †The horse-drawn buggy approach to financial life could be a good financial life. Iím not willing to actually go along with the Amish pastoral investing life, however, either in my own life or for people who ask me my opinion on what they should do. Mutual funds, to pick the most beautiful of the babies youíve tossed out with the bathwater, are just like some of the other totally awesome things we love to complain about.† If youíve got money to invest, with a few clicks or a simple phone call, you can own a piece of a wide swath of the worldís most successful companies.† At any point in your lifetime, should you choose, you can get your investment back with a similar amount of effort, with a dayís notice.† Real property investing doesnít work that way.† CDs donít work that way.† Private business investing doesnít work that way.† Our grandparents had to wait for the end of their 6 months (or whatever time) period to get their cash out of CDs, or possibly years to liquidate their real estate or private businesses. ETFs, the ADHD suffererís version of mutual funds, are similarly awesome, if used correctly.† You can even invest in a wider variety of instruments than mutual funds, including currencies, commodities, real estate, in addition to the opportunity to short markets and take on leverage. As a recovering hedge fund manager, I also obviously maintain a soft spot in my heart for hedge funds as a way to access a still wider variety of investing strategies.† As a former mortgage bond salesman as well, I could similarly wax poetic about a whole universe of investment vehicles with an alphabet soup of acronyms that, like an Elizabethan sonneteer declaring his undying devotion, would make you long to† possess a super-senior CDO linked to a basket of credit default swap positions.† Ah, financial innovationÖBut I digress.† Where was I? In sum, Iím actually a fan of financial technology, albeit with one important caveat that I think will link back to your original question, about whether the financial game is incorrigibly rigged for the Big Boys. Not to be too John Kerry about it, but my answer is No, and Yes. I infer that what you mean by ìriggedî is the idea that insiders cheat in sufficient numbers to leave outsiders at a severe disadvantage when it comes to earning a fair and worthwhile return on capital. I disagree.† In my fifteen years in the financial industry I saw no evidence of widespread cheating.† On the contrary, I can honestly say I trust ìthe systemî in our country to treat outsiders far more fairly than any other industry Iím aware of.† I would also trust our system in the US better than any other countryís financial system, based on quite a bit of anecdotal and experiential evidence across borders. Where I would blanket-statement agree on the rigged part for your average outside investor, however, is in costs.† The insiders depend on your ignorance of the cost of their product. Most investment products designed in the past 50 years are compensation schemes for insiders. Hedge funds are the most egregious example, of course, as knowledgeable insiders correctly and dismissively refer to hedge funds as ëcompensation schemes masking as investment vehicles.î Products like retail ETFs, primary designed to encourage high-frequency day-trading, wrap up a casino-like product in an investing package, for the benefit of the house casino. Even the mutual fund industry typically charges far more than is necessary to accomplish what are really simple tasks with minimal value-added. Fees to insiders in all of these areas remain stubbornly high and extremely difficult to track down for the average outsider.† In no other area of life do we willingly purchase a product costing many thousands of dollars without asking about the price of the product or attempting to price-shop the product. I canít emphasize enough how much of the inside game is devoted to convincing outsiders of the ëspecial sauceí of a particular investment vehicle.† Contrary to what the insiders want you to believe, simple would generally be better and low cost would be best of all. I linked to this page before, but it bears repeating.† I have no link to this investment advisor, Iíve never met him, and I just found his stuff a month ago.† Do yourself a favor, print out pages 9-12, post them on your bulletin board, and refer to them frequently when considering where and how to invest. [1] He famously advised people to avoid eating anything your great-great-grandmother wouldnít recognize as food.† Incidentally, my great-great-grandmother ate a lot of Nutella.† In my own mind.

Alan Neuhauser/DNAinfo.comMIDTOWN ó Job hunters searching for discreet interview spots safe from the prying eyes of current employers may have a haven in Midtown. Restaurant Thalia, located on Eighth Avenue near West 50th Street, is billing itself as a low-pressure eatery ideal for under-the-radar meet-ups. "We are the perfect place for covert job interviews. Your secret's safe with us," the restaurant boasted in one of two Twitter posts, adding that its Monday lunch rush was peopled by "laid back lunch meetings or secret interviews for your next job. ;)" Industry experts called the marketing approach one-of-a-kind. "I have not heard of a restaurant promoting themselves that way," said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. "But it's a unique way to market your business. We'll see if it becomes a positive techniqueÖ now that the cat's out of the bag." Charisse Arboleda, a hostess at Restaurant Thalia who runs the establishment's social-media outreach, said her tweets were inspired "only out of observation. Lately I see this all the time. It's just obvious, an employer waiting for someone, or a potential employee, he's funny, has energy. It's been going on." The restaurant is large, with space to seat as many as 191 people, she pointed out, reducing the chance of an unwanted encounter with a current boss or gabby coworker. Plus, she added, "We have a pretty nice, casual ambience. At night, it becomes a romantic place, but it's not that romantic during lunch." Which has perhaps helped limit the restaurants' illicit rendezvous to just job interviews, as opposed to more romantically-inclined meetings that might also call for subterfuge. "I've never really observed those," Arboleda, 33, said. "At least during lunch." More from DNAinfo.com:

Bloomberg TV screengrabBillionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper is still extremely bullish and he thinks the S&amp;P could rise 20 percent or more this year, CNBC's Kate Kelly reported on "Halftime Report" citing an unnamed source familiar with his thinking. Tepper, the founder of $12 billion-distressed-debt hedge fund Appaloosa Management,¬†doesn't see much more than short term volatility, Kelly said. She added that he's surprised that the year-to-date hasn't been stronger, according to a source familiar with Tepper's thinking. Tepper also sees real GDP growth of 2.25% and a lot of cash on the sidelines. Tepper has a track record for being one of the best performing hedge fund managers on the Street. ¬†So far this year, he's up more than 10%. ¬†February was flat for Tepper, according to Kelly.¬† Back in January, Tepper told Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle that he was going to "come out of the closet" as being bullish in 2013.¬† His reasoning was that there there were no major negatives and basically nothing to really be bearish about. "This country is on the verge of an explosion of greatness,"¬†he told Bloomberg TV,¬†"An explosion of greatness."
Earlier today I posted a commentary on Some Stunning Demographic Trends in Employment. In a footnote I commented on the unreliability of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment data for Nonfarm Payroll Employment, which included a link to historic revisions back to 1979 on the BLS website. I subsequently received a few emails requesting a chart to illustrate the changes. Here is a first pass at such a visualization. I took the data since January 2000 and plotted the change from the first to third estimate for each month through December 2012, the most recent month for which we have three revisions. During this timeframe there were 92 upward revisions and 62 downward revisions. The absolute mean (average) revision was 46 thousand, which breaks down as 48K for the upward adjustments and 45K for the downward adjustments. Interestingly enough, the direction of revisions was upward during the brief recession of 2001 but downward during the nasty recession from December 2007 to June 2009. The message is clear: Don't take the initial monthly employment jobs data too seriously.
The euro area's economic fortunes continue to diverge from those of the United States. In a new report this morning, Morgan Stanley downgraded its euro zone GDP forecast, citing weakness in France, Italy, and the Netherlands ñ some of the bloc's biggest economies. Perhaps most importantly, though ñ as Deutsche Bank strategist Bilal Hafeez points out in a note today ñ the euro area economy hasn't even begun deleveraging yet. In fact, the exact opposite is happening. The chart below shows total domestic debt, which aggregates government debt, private sector debt, and household debt. Whereas total U.S. debt is down to 340 percent of GDP after topping out at 370 percent in early 2009, the same measure in the euro area has actually continued increasing, and now stands near 390 percent of GDP. Deutsche Bank, EcoWin "So, for all the talk of austerity in the euro area, overall debt as a share of GDP has actually risen, while the debt ratio in the U.S. has fallen since 2008," writes Hafeez. Hafeez notes that public-sector releveraging (increased government spending) has essentially allowed the banking system to deleverage somewhat from peak credit in 2007/2008, and it's also facilitated households' ability to pay down debt. Deutsche Bank, EcoWin Contrast that with Europe, where "debt levels as a share of GDP have remained unchanged for the household, business and financial sectors since the 2008 crisis." In other words, "there has been no private sector deleveraging" in the euro area, writes Hafeez. "Meanwhile, the government debt ratio has risen." This all leads to an indictment of the policy approach in the euro area, writes Hafeez: The U.S. approach of staggering the deleveraging process across sectors appears to have worked well, while the euro area approach of private sector forbearance and public sector austerity appears not to have led to overall deleveraging. What has undoubtedly helped the U.S. has been that nominal GDP growth has been more than double that of the Euro-area since early 2009. So the U.S. has been able to keep domestic demand stronger than the Euro-area by its staggered deleveraging. The bottom line is that both growth prospects and the speed of overall deleveraging give the U.S. dollar a significant advantage over the euro for the coming years. These comments echo those of SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale strategist Kit Juckes, who told Business Insider, "U.S. economic outperformance reflects a better policy response than in Europe, and the U.S. has effectively 'won' the currency wars." "Jobs are returning, the trade deficit falling," says Juckes. "And most of all, even though [Federal Reserve] tightening is still a long way off, it's much closer than ECB or BoE or, most of all, BoJ tightening." There's still a lot of work to do in Europe.
CNBCWith the U.S. economic data coming in increasingly positive, economists have been forced to raise their forecasts for GDP growth. In the wake of today's bullish retail sales report, Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna has raised his estimates. Here's a summary: Here's an excerpt from LaVorgna's note where he explains why: The forecast adjustment was due to three developments: One, last week‚Äôs net exports data for January showed stronger than expected exports. The improvement in exports has been corroborated by the ISM survey, which showed further noticeable improvement in February. Two, February retail sales surprised significantly to the upside, and there were upward revisions. Notably, this was despite tremendous headwinds from the payroll tax hike, slower refunds and rising gasoline prices. March retail sales should get a boost from an early Easter Holiday (March 31) and a faster disbursement of refunds. The upshot is a much faster pace of Q1 consumption than what we had been forecasting, +2.5% currently versus +1.5% previously. This accounts for about half of our Q1 upward revision. Three, inventory restocking is progressing at a faster pace than what we had envisioned‚Äîthis week‚Äôs January business inventories were up +1.0%, and we also had upward revisions. Lavorgna also reminded us that durable goods orders, ISM surveys, employment, and housing have all been stronger than expected.
Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus growled Monday on Sean Hannityís Fox News show. ìItís going to be the big corporations, right? And who gets screwed? The middle class.î The Republican Party makeover is breathtaking. Now, suddenly, instead of accusing Democrats of being ìredistributionists,î the GOP is posing as defender of the middle class against corporate America ó and itís doing so by proposing to do away with the most progressive piece of legislation in well over a decade. Paul Ryanís new budget purportedly gets about 40 percent of its $4.6 trillion in spending cuts over ten years by repealing Obamacare, but Ryanís budget document doesnít mention that such a repeal would also lower taxes on corporations and the wealthy that foot Obamacareís bill. According to an†analysis†by the non-partisan Tax Foundation, Obamacare redistributes income from the wealthy to the middle class. This is mainly because it hikes Medicare taxes on the top 2 percent (singles earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000, including their investment income). This year, for example, families in the top 1 percent will be paying about $52,000 more in Medicare taxes, on average, than they paid in 2012. And where will the money go? Not to pay for the healthcare of poor families; most of them already receive Medicaid. The rich will be helping middle and lower-middle class Americans. Obamacare also imposes some taxes and fees on insurance companies, drug makers, and manufacturers of medical devices. Here again, most of this will be borne by affluent Americans, who own most shares of stock (assuming the taxes and fees come out of corporate profits). And, again, beneficiaries are in the middle and lower-middle class. In other words, Mr. Priebus has it exactly backwards. If Obamacare were repealed, who would end up making all the money? Big corporations and the wealthy. Who would get screwed? The middle class. The rest of Ryanís budget plan also runs counter to the new Republican thematic. Not only does it turn Medicare into vouchers (ìpremium supportî in Republican-speak) whose value canít possibly keep up with rising healthcare costs but it also dramatically reduces spending on education, infrastructure, and much else the middle class depends on. Meanwhile, it redistributes upward, cutting the top tax rate for individuals down to 25 percent ó a bigger tax cut for the top than even Mitt Romney proposed ó and the corporate tax rate down to 25 percent, from 35 percent today. Ryan would pay for these tax cuts by ìclosing tax loopholes,î but ó where did we hear this before? ó his budget doesnít say which loopholes, or even hint at what it would do with rates on capital gains and dividends. Like Romneyís plan, it leaves all the heavy lifting to Congress. The reality, of course, is that the only possible way Ryan could pay for his proposed tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations would be to raise taxes on the middle class. Donít expect the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, or other Republicans reading from the same talking points, to admit any of this. But if you look at what theyíre proposing rather than what theyíre saying, the GOP isnít really interested in balancing the budget at all. Itís out to redistribute income and wealth ó to the best-off Americans, from everyone else. If any party is into redistribution, itís the Republicans. And Paul Ryan is leading the charge.†
Daniel Goodman/Business InsiderThere's owning a steakhouse, and then there's perfecting steak. There's choosing cuts of meat, and then there's innovating meat with new cuts no one has ever had before. New York's Old Homestead Steakhouse specializes in perfection and innovation. Owners Greg and Marc Sherry have gone farther than just keeping a classic steakhouse feel in their restaurant, they're basically American steak ambassadors. Thanks to their efforts, Wagyu (more commonly known as Kobe beef) was brought to America from Japan in the early 1990s. Now the restaurant serves the most expensive cut of steak in the city. A $350 piece of Wagyu beef carefully sliced and imported from Kobe. "It's become a cult [thing] to come here and get a steak for $350 and a great bottle of wine," Greg Sherry told Business Insider. Just ask the guy who once had two cuts prepared and taken to his private plane. Or any of the parade of celebrities who have come in to the restaurant to try the cut of meat that Sherry describes as "the 4th of July in your mouth." The brothers found Wagyu when they went to Japan in the 1990s, tried the meat and immediately fell in love. Wagyu beef is fed on barley and bathed with beer. The cows are not allowed to graze so they don't develop muscles. Instead, their meat is full of fat (as you can see from all the white marbling on the left). Old HomesteadSherry told Business Insider that to get American food regulators to allow Wagyu into the country, he and his brother had to work with Japanese farmers to bring their facilities up to American health code. And so Old Homestead was first to bring the beef to America. But back to the place. Old Homestead has been around since 1868, when it was called the Tidewater Trading Post because the Hudson River crept right along the restaurant's West 14th and 9th Avenue location. The river has since receded, and what was once a neighborhood of meat purveyors and dock workers is now home to some of the most glamorous hotels and nightclubs in the world. Google's New York office is right around the corner. The Sherry family has owned the restaurant since the 1940s, when Harry Sherry, who started out there as a dishwasher, bought it from its former owner. "This was my favorite," Greg, Harry's grandson, told Business Insider. "I was groomed here, I was weened here." The relationships Harry established, and that his grandsons maintained, secured that Old Homestead gets the best, freshest cuts regardless of what's going on in the meat market. The restaurant has expanded too, with locations at Caesars in Las Vegas and The Borgata in Atlantic City. "I've been doing this for 40 years, you can't fake me out... I'm obsessed with quality control," Greg Sherry said, adding "We specialize in the four food groups, beef, beef, beef, and beef."
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVThe latest note from BofA/ML economist Michelle Meyer hints at the sense of enthusiasm and animal spirits that people are feeling in the U.S. economy. The title is: "The bottomless pocketbook." It refers to this morning's strong retail sales report, which has led Meyer to up her GDP forecast to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent: Retail sales jumped 1.1% in February, while ìcore controlî (ex-autos, building materials and gasoline) increased 0.4%. This shows resiliency on the part of the US consumer, given the headwinds in February, including higher taxes, delayed tax refunds, rising gasoline prices and poor weather conditions. The tailwinds, including stronger job growth and wealth appreciation, are seemingly stronger than we had believed. While we continue to look for softening in coming months from the lagged impact of fiscal cuts, we must acknowledge better momentum from the consumer. We are now tracking 2.6% for Q1 GDP, up from our prior tracking forecast of 2.2%. ... We can learn two lessons from this data: 1) consumers have greater support through labor income and wealth appreciation, which has also led to greater confidence, and 2) consumers may be willing to accept a lower saving rate for a period of time. The saving rate collapsed to 2.4% in January, the lowest level since prior to the crisis, and after todayís retail sales report, it appears consumers did little to build back savings in February.

Advisor Perspectives has an excerpt. One of the questions posed to Ackman had to do with him being in the press frequently. A lot of hedge fund managers won't ever speak to the press, especially when it comes to their short positions. † Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, is arguably one of the most media savvy fund managers out there. Right now, he's in the spot light for his $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a nutrition supplement seller he claims is a pyramid scheme. † He explains why he's so public. From VII:† Maintaining a high public profile appears to be important to the execution of your strategy. Why is that? The press is a necessary element of the strategy. Look at something like Procter &amp; Gamble. We havenít run a proxy contest. We havenít made a public presentation. All we did is buy some stock. That became publicly known and immediately the press was all over the company and what they were or werenít doing right. That saved us a lot of time and energy. On solid, high-profile boards of companies that are underperforming, sometimes the directors just need a little bit of a push. One of the best pushes is a reputational push, which a press spotlight can administer. That spotlight can be particularly important in our shorts. We donít short on valuation, but in situations where we believe a company is violating the law, or has misleading or inaccurate accounting, or has a potential regulatory problem. In these cases the attention really matters. If youíre a regulator with any sort of oversight of Herbalife [HLF], how can you ignore it when a reputable investor who has spent 18 months researching it says it is a certainty that the company is a pyramid scheme? Imagine if Iím right and theyíve done nothing on a company thatís in the paper everyday. Read more of the interview at Advisor Perspectives.
Believe it or not, hedge funds do not run the stock market.† In fact, they own only 3 percent of the market. "Hedge funds and ETFs represent small but growing shares of the equity market," wrote Goldman Sachs' David Kostin in a new report to clients. "Households directly own 38 percent of the US equity market," he wrote. "However, the total effective household ownership is closer to 80 percent when combined with indirect ownership in the form of mutual funds (20 percent), pension funds (16 percent), and insurance policy holdings (7 percent)." Here's the chart breaking down the ownership mix since the 1940s: Goldman Sachs
There have been waves of threats by Eurozone politicians to bully people into accepting ‚Äúwhatever it takes‚Äù to keep the shaky construct of the monetary union glued together. These threats peaked last year with disorderly default, and when that wasn‚Äôt enough, with the collapse of the Eurozone. But now, the ultimate threat has been pronounced: war. It wasn‚Äôt an idle thought by a wayward parliamentarian on the radical fringe but a well-articulated statement by Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker who was, until January, the President of the Eurogroup that manages the political aspects of the euro.And he‚Äôd picked Europe‚Äôs largest magazine, Der Spiegel, to make it (excerpts here, rest behind pay wall). He‚Äôd alluded to it before. Last August, as he was jabbering about Greece‚Äôs potential exit from the Eurozone, he lamented that ‚Äúmany Germans and the German media‚Äù talked about Greece as if it were ‚Äúa people you couldn‚Äôt respect,‚Äù and that Greeks depicted Chancellor Angela Merkel as if she were ‚Äúthe heiress of the Nazis.‚Äù And then his big threat, albeit in veiled form: ‚ÄúWhat we thought had been buried long ago, very quickly rises again.‚Äù His problem: the halting integration of Europe. European countries were small, but there was a solution. ‚ÄúWe must show the world something giant, and that‚Äôs the euro,‚Äù he said. He wanted Europeans to integrate more closely. And not just within the EU, but ‚Äúthe total continent, with extensions‚Äù‚Äîso maybe Turkey. They‚Äôd all eventually use the euro. And if it didn‚Äôt work out.... That was last year. Now, given the Italian election, he made it explicit. ‚ÄúFor my generation, the common currency has always been a policy of peace,‚Äù he said. He was worried that people were getting lost in national naval gazing. ‚ÄúThose who believe that the eternal question of war and peace in Europe would never reappear could be seriously mistaken,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe demons aren‚Äôt gone; they‚Äôre only sleeping, as the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo have shown.‚Äù The possibility of war‚Äîunless the euro survived and became the currency of the entire EU. He was struck by the realization how much the European conditions resembled those of 1913, on the eve of World War I. But then, after having thrown ‚Äúwar‚Äù on the table, he backed off; he didn‚Äôt believe that Europe was facing armed conflicts, but he saw ‚Äúconspicuous parallels.‚Äù In 1913, the prevailing wisdom was that there could never be another war in Europe because the powers on the continent were economically so interwoven that they couldn‚Äôt afford it, he said. ‚ÄúParticularly in Western and Northern Europe, there reigned a complacency that assumed that peace had been secured forever.‚Äù By 2050, Europe would have about 7% of the world population, he said. In order to remain relevant, it would have to be united. The heads of the governments in Germany, France, and Great Britain knew that their voices were heard internationally only because they were speaking through the ‚Äúmegaphone‚Äù of the EU. And the EU‚Äôs destiny was the euro. He listed proudly the ‚Äúserious reforms‚Äù that had been carried out, like keeping Greece in the Eurozone‚Äîregardless of what that did to the Greeks whose belts had been tightened by five notches, or what it did to their¬† economy that would be downgraded to ‚Äúdeveloping nation‚Äù effective June 2013. He praised the bailout funds and the European banking union‚Äîregardless of how they‚Äôd use taxpayers in some countries to bail out banks and their investors in others. But hadn‚Äôt the elections in Italy shown that Southern Europeans weren‚Äôt all that enthusiastic about his glorious plans? Hadn‚Äôt Italian voters just demolished Prime Minister Mario Monti and his pro-euro course of reforms and austerity? It didn‚Äôt matter. Abandoning the austerity policies ‚Äúwould be a big mistake,‚Äù he explained. Politicians shouldn‚Äôt promote the ‚Äúwrong policies‚Äù just because they were afraid they‚Äôd lose the next election. ‚ÄúIf you want to govern, you must take responsibility for your country and Europe overall. And that means: you must implement the correct policies even if many voters find them wrong.‚Äù A curious understanding of democracy. One fraught with peril. But one that has become all too common in the Eurozone where the will of the people has consistently been trampled into the ground. To make his message more persuasive, to get politicians to toe the line, to get taxpayers in financially stable countries to give up resisting the transnational wealth transfers, and to get the people in crisis countries to swallow without demur the bitter pills of his reform programs, he‚Äôd added what has become the ultimate threat in the euro bailout and austerity racket‚Äîthe possibility of war. But there may be complications. The ECB and the national central banks of the Eurozone set out to collect information on household wealth. A massive bureaucratic undertaking. Results are now ready. No one in Europe had ever done a survey on that scale before. And no one might ever do it again. Because the results are so explosive that the Bundesbank is keeping its report secret‚Äîand word has leaked out why.

Chinese ghost towns are widely considered to be symptomatic of its property bubble. But some, like Yale professor and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, Stephen Roach, have argued that these cities will become "thriving metropolitan areas" as China continues to urbanize. In a new report titled Demystifying China's "Ghost Towns," Bank of America's Ting Lu explains why all the chatter on ghost cities is overblown and says while there are smaller bubbles, it is inaccurate to characterize China's entire property sector as a giant bubble. Lu writes that there are a few ghost towns because of "failures in city planning and irrational over-building," but they are not as prevalent as media reports would have us believe. If there were, he said, the media would be able to find a lot more ghost towns than they have. "Favorite ìghost townsî covered in media have been invariably from the following short list: Ordos in Inner Mongolia province, the New South China Mall in Guangdong province, Chenggong in Yunnan province, Yujiapu in Tianjin municipality and Zhengdong in Henan province. The fact that global media failed to greatly expand the list in the past few years suggests that the number of ghost towns in China should be quite limited." Lu also says there is a huge difference between China and developed markets that saw their housing bubbles burst. In China, the economy is still growing fast, as is the urban population. Media reports also frequently say China has 65 million vacant homes. Lu calls into question the veracity of this data. The number, he said, came from China's State Grid data that said 65 million electricity meters in China were not operating, but it isn't clear whether this is because of vacant homes or because many of these just don't run. In fact, he said it's possible to see ghost villages since the country has 150 million migrant workers, but that 65 million vacant urban homes is a stretch. Based on his calculations of urban housing stock (129 million urban homes have been built since 1995), and factoring in things like the fact that some apartments lack toilets, kitchens and so on when they are first built, and people take some time to move in, there should be 20 million vacant homes in urban China. Bank of AmericaConsidering that policymakers are focusing on urbanization as a key growth driver, housing demand in Chinese cities is expected to surge. China's urbanization rate is up to 53 percent, from 39 percent in the past decade, and is expected to continue to rise to 65 percent in the next ten years. And as the government relaxes its hukou (residency permit) policy, urban residents are also expected to move from dorms to homes. He also took aim at the "60 Minutes" report that aired a few weeks ago. Lu writes that the reporter got some of the facts wrong. Lu doesn't expect that there is a huge property bubble that is set to burst. "Home prices vs. income growth, affordability, and housing value [lead me] to conclude that Chinaís property sector is not as worrying as those 'ghost town' reports have depicted."
Less than a week after the Obama administration suspended public tours of the White House in response to sequestration budget cuts, the President appears to be caving to Republican backlash over the decision. † In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that aired Wednesday morning, Obama said that he is asking the Secret Service to revisit their decision to shut down the tours. He added that the agency made the call without input from the West Wing, citing the need for furloughs.† ìWhat Iím asking them is are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups Ö who may have traveled here with some bake sales," Obama said. "Can we make sure that ñ kids, potentially, can...still come to tour?"† "Iím always amused when people on the one hand say, the sequester doesnít mean anything and the administrationís exaggerating its effects; and then whatever the specific effects are, they yell and scream and say, ëWhy are you doing that?íî Obama added. ìWell, there are consequences to Congress not having come up with a more sensible way to reduce the deficit.î Watch the full interview below:†
MyspaceThe New York Post's Dana Schuster has a wild piece about an amateur strip club that caters to the young finance crowd. It's called Saint Venus Theater and it's an exclusive, members-only club that meets in secret locations throughout New York City. Only those who are on the e-mail list know the location of the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday events that take place.†You have to fill out an application to be considered for membership.† The club was established just for finance guys. Saint Venus Theater was started three years ago by a man with a ponytail named Rob S. for his Wall Street friends. †As of June 2011, the membership list had about 3,300 clients, according to a†New York Observer†report.† The strippers aren't your typical full-time strippers either. According to the Post, they are "good girls" with normal professional lives and college degrees, but need to make extra money on the side. From The NY Post: ìThe art gallery doesnít pay my bills,î says Christine, a 22-year-old who works full time Monday to Friday downtown. ìI just want to have more money,î says Lisa, a 22-year-old graduate of a top design school who works unpaid at a fashion start-up. ìI want to go shopping.î Attendees say it makes them feel like they could have gone to high school or college with the girls. The club's Myspace page, which is definitely not safe for work, features an entire photo gallery these scantily clad young girls giving lap dances to clients. †You can see the faces of some of the guys. † Still, on its website (NSFW), Saint Venus Theater insists that it's "not a strip club, a burlesque revival show, a swingers event, or a fetish party." "We want to excite one's heart, mind, soul and libido, not just the libido. We have a wide variety of erotic performances that are always a tribute to woman and female sexuality."† Weird.†
Rob Wile/Business InsiderThe U.S. dollar is back! Thanks to a U.S. economy that is outperforming its peers in the developed world, an improving energy trade balance spurred by a domestic energy boom, and a shifting interest rate environment, market practitioners are coming around to the notion that the dollar is poised to enter a new bull market. However, it wasn't always so. While concerns about the demise of the dollar are nearly as old as the Republic itself, it was only recently that people were seriously freaked out about the dollar's weakness, and the end of its global dominance. In 2002, the U.S. dollar index peaked, subsequently losing 40 percent of its value over the next nine years. Some of the first dollar-death calls came amid an era that saw two costly wars initiated in the Middle East and big tax cuts by President George W. Bush, both of which helped to send U.S. deficits skyrocketing. A typical¬†analysis of the situation from the BBC, written at the height of the Iraq war, did not fail to mention these factors. JPMorganMeanwhile, the euro was rising. It had been introduced only a few years before, in 1999, and for the first time, there was perhaps to be a real alternative to the dollar as a global reserve currency. Global central banks, therefore, began diversifying away from the dollar in favor of the euro. Even rappers became involved in the unfolding story. The infamous video for Jay-Z's 2007 single, "Blue Magic," includes a depiction of a stack of euros being counted.¬† YoutubeScreengrab from Jay Z's "Blue Magic" The Associated Press interpreted the imagery thus: "Jay-Z's new video for 'Blue Magic'¬†seems to attempt to acknowledge the dollar's decline in an ironic way and to paint the artist as an international hustler who is smarter than those accepting greenbacks." "When the [Federal Reserve] was running really easy policy from 2003, the rest of the world wasn't, so being a dollar bear seemed obvious,"¬†Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale currency strategist Kit Juckes told Business Insider. The first abrupt changed came in 2008, though. Markets crashed in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, sending investors fleeing to the U.S. dollar for safety as part of the biggest "risk-off" move in modern history. It was evidence that in a panic, the world still craved greenbacks. However, the strength in the U.S. dollar index was short-lived, as by early 2009 investors were moving back into stocks, and the dollar continued its downward trajectory as "risk-on" sentiment returned. It got so bad that in 2009, Time Magazine¬†twice¬†asked¬†whether it was ‚Äúdying a slow death.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn 10 years' time it won't be such a dollar-dominated world. I'm sure of that,‚Äù Harvard economic historian Niall Ferguson told the magazine. Then, everyone else started doing way worse. "Sovereign credit worries in Europe and Japan are leading to some general risk aversion," an analyst¬†told Reuters in March 2010¬†(a prescient description of what was to come in the next few years). The euro area became embroiled in what has at times been a rather terrifying crisis, and emerging markets felt the painful effects of euro-zone bank deleveraging. Japan has struggled with nonstop political instability, not to mention a massively disruptive earthquake and nuclear disaster. While the post-crisis recovery in the United States has been tepid by historical standards, it's clearly done well when compared to the world's other developed economies. Now, everyone seems bullish on the U.S. dollar and is calling the big turn upward. Of course, even though the general perception in the American psyche after a decade-long decline in the value of its currency is one of dollar weakness ‚Äì after all, it's been a long way down ‚Äì this upward turn isn't actually a brand new development. In fact, according to Marc Chandler, head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, "the bull market in the dollar began several years ago." "The thing is that the dollar bull market is well entrenched," Chandler told Business Insider. "You might have just discovered it ‚Äì some people on Wall Street might have just discovered it ‚Äì but it's been underway for years." Bloomberg, Business InsiderThe chart at left shows what Chandler is talking about. The British pound sterling peaked against the dollar in 2007. The euro peaked against the dollar shortly thereafter, in 2008. The Japanese yen is the last major currency to top out (against the dollar), but since September, it's turned down decisively, and many expect the yen's tumble to continue, thanks to a new government that seems committed to taking extraordinary monetary measures to weaken the currency. The chart that has everyone buzzing in the last few weeks, though, is the one below, which shows an important change in the behavior of the dollar at home. Morgan StanleyOnly recently, the dollar has become positively correlated with risky assets like the U.S. stock market, reversing the relationship that has governed the relative performance of the two asset classes for a long time. (This positive correlation isn't unprecedented, but it hasn't really been observed sustainably since the 1995-2000 period.) Can the stock market and the dollar really rise in unison, though?¬†What exactly is happening here? In a recent report, SocGen's Kit Juckes wrote, "We are leaving ‚Äòrisk-on/risk-off‚Äô, and entering an age where growth determines FX performance." If that is the case, it's good news for the U.S. dollar. The U.S. economy now stands out as the clear growth leader in the developed world. Just look at the data out of Britain (the pound sterling is certainly paying for it), the euro zone, and Japan (even China is seeing fresh new growth concerns). Aside from an improving labor market (compare with the euro zone, where unemployment in many areas is still spiraling out of control) and a recovery in manufacturing, there is another bright spot in the U.S. economy that other countries can't claim ‚Äì a nascent boom in domestic energy production. SocGen currency strategist Sebastien Galy told Business Insider that this development on the energy front is "a fundamental shift...in the balance sheet of the U.S. which determines its credit-worthiness in the eyes of long term investors." David Woo, a rates strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, penned a big report this week explaining the mechanics behind the U.S. energy boom's supportive effect on the dollar. The gist of it is this: U.S. energy production has surged in recent years. At the same time, consumption has flatlined. Naturally, this means America's trade balance ‚Äì driven by the energy component ‚Äì is improving. BofA Merrill Lynch Global ResearchIn contrast, energy trade balances in the euro area and Japan continue to get worse. The rise of Chinese energy consumption has driven oil prices up. When the U.S. was more dependent on imports for oil, rising oil prices meant the dollar weakened. Now that the U.S. is becoming less dependent on oil imports, that negative correlation between oil prices and the U.S. dollar is fading away. "Going forward, it will be Europe rather than the U.S. that will have to bear the brunt of the cost associated with the growing number of Chinese and Indian consumers and their appetite for energy," writes Woo. In Britain, the trend in the petroleum balance is similar to that in the euro zone and in Japan.¬†These developments on the energy front are thus good for the value of the dollar and bad for those of the euro, the pound, and the yen. In addition to the energy boom, there is another compelling catalyst for dollar strength on the horizon in the United States. As of November 2012. Click to enlargeU.S. Treasuries appear to be closing in on the end of a 30-year bull market rally. In just the last few years since the market peaked in 2007, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into bond funds while equity funds have suffered massive outflows. Many analysts expect this trend to reverse as the U.S. economy strengthens. The idea is that perhaps in late 2013 or sometime in 2014, investors will begin to re-allocate a significant portion of their portfolios from bonds to stocks. This, of course, means rising interest rates from their current ultra-low levels, and that will make dollars more attractive relative to other developed-market currencies for international investors seeking yield opportunities. The yen, on the other hand, is undergoing a shift in the exact opposite direction. After years of stubbornly high real interest rates, the new monetary regime spearheaded by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is finally forcing them downward. In recent years, investors piled into yen as a safe-haven currency, helping to drive up its value. Now, with the yen expected to weaken dramatically (and in fact, it already has weakened substantially since September), there is talk of the yen returning to its old role as a funding currency. Deutsche Bank, EcoWinClick to enlargeIn other words, investors are starting to consider the prospect of borrowing yen in order to fund purchases of higher-yielding currencies. Deutsche Bank strategist Bilal Hafeez notes in a recent report that interestingly, during the three major turns in the U.S. dollar since 1995, the USD/JPY exchange rate has always been one of the last currency crosses to confirm the big change in trend. That seems to be happening again now. Therefore, Hafeez thinks the yen's stunning slide against the dollar in recent months is a big deal. He writes: The significance of the USD/JPY turn higher should not be understated. It is perhaps the only currency pair that has captured all the major macro themes since the 2008: an aversion to crisis-prone regions, ultra-easy Fed policy, the Euro-area crisis, and the investment boom in China. All these have until recently been positive for the yen against the dollar, and indeed contributed to the all-time high seen in the yen. The fact that the yen has now so decisively turned lower suggests markets are entering a new regime.  The notable shifts in market behaviour include the complete breakdown of the relationship between relative interest rates and USD/JPY and the declining correlation between the dollar and equities, such that the dollar is no longer weakening in ‚Äúrisk-on‚Äù periods.¬† When you put it all together, the reasons why it's hard to find anyone betting on the euro, the yen, or the pound at the moment become clear. Naturally, the opposite is now true for the dollar. "It‚Äôs the default long among the majors already," Deutsche Bank strategist Alan Ruskin told Business Insider. Galy agrees. "Lack of better choice is helping to boost the USD as investors assess their risk return ratios," he said. What about quantitative easing, though? The Federal Reserve is still buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities every month, and it doesn't look like the central bank is planning on easing up any time soon. Of course, with currencies, it's all relative.¬† "Some people who are bearish on the dollar talk about quantitative easing as if the currency market is just driven by one factor ‚Äì¬†monetary policy," Chandler says. "But even if you want to think the currencies are driven just by monetary policy, I would look at the balance sheets of [central banks in] other countries." Deutsche Bank, EcoWinA look at some of those balance sheets reveals that the Fed's ‚Äì relative to GDP ‚Äì isn't as big as those of others. One important observation here, though, says Ruskin, is that the "ECB balance sheet is shrinking, and shrinking sharply relative to the Fed balance sheet." If this continues, it could certainly restrain the rate of dollar appreciation. However, given the state of the euro area economy, ECB monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative for an extended period of time. "Even though Fed tightening is still a long way off," says Juckes, "it's much closer than ECB or BoE or, most of all, BoJ tightening." All of this means that the recent recoupling between rising U.S. stocks and a rising dollar could be a sign of something new.¬† Citi strategist Steven Englander is not convinced, however. "I think the jury is still out on the USD," Englander told Business Insider. "I am surprised at the pro-risk USD correlation, and do not discount the possibility that it will continue, but it still seems fragile." Englander says this particular dollar rally is missing that special something evident in previous bull markets: The positive correlation with risk over the last two months is unusual but not unprecedented. The USD is more typically a safe haven currency. When we have had big USD-positive rallies in the past, it has been because there was a U.S. asset that was uniquely attractive, such as real Treasury yields during the Reagan rally or high tech during the internet boom.¬†Now, we have a weaker form of USD uniqueness. Despite long-term concerns on U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, we are getting short-term outperformance in the U.S. economy and asset markets. This is largely because EM is treading water and the rest of G4 is in pain, but it is real outperformance nevertheless that makes the USD attractive.This may continue, but does not make the USD the blinding buy of the early 1980s or late 1990s, keeping in mind that our macro policies leave something to be desired. Moreover, the USD bounce does not seem structural, and could be turned around by other regions gaining traction.¬†Tax reform, entitlement reform, or energy independence would be structural, but we are not there yet. Hence my view that for now there are better themes to focus on (short GBP, short JPY and keeping an eye out for a potential EM rally). Nonetheless, the current tone toward the dollar is quite bullish. "All currencies appear to have peaked against the dollar from a purely mechanical perspective," Hafeez writes in the Deutsche Bank report. "If anything, we risk underestimating the extent of dollar strength in coming years."
World events are getting more complicated. US markets are ignoring these issues as central bank zero-interest-rate policies continue to drive asset prices higher. When things are event-driven, an investor has two options: (1) stand aside. Today that means cash earning zero while inflation erodes value.  Or, secondly, an investor can remain nervously invested and attempt to move nimbly. Other options are really allocation combinations of these first two. The 2013 event inventory includes: Washington's political antics, China's growth vs. real estate bubble policy, Japan's central bank's highly stimulative regime change, Italy's government-election mess, Eurozone recession risk, the Bank of England governing body's recomposition, Egypt's civil instability, Syria, Iran nukes, the dispute between China and Japan over islands and what lies beneath them or in the territorial waters around them, Nigeria's instability, and post-Chavez Venezuela. Lastly in this partial list, and newly on the front page, is North Korea. Let's get to North Korea. The situation seems to be intensifying. The new young Kim has set a course that is more harsh and militaristic than expected. When armistice agreements are revoked and readiness states of armies ratchet up, the risk rises of an accident leading to war. We have obtained permission to post a March 7, 2013 commentary about North Korea on our website. NightWatch is following these events closely. You can find their discussion under the "Special Reports" section at www.cumber.com, or the direct URL is http://www.kforcegov.com/Services/IS/NightWatch/NightWatch_13000059.aspx. Two key points must be noted. "In the NightWatch experience, the last time North Korean media and behavior were so bellicose was prior to the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul." That is the historical reference. Point 2: North Korea failed to act in the late 1980s.† At that time the US had an aircraft carrier group and a battleship group deployed off the North Korean coast. Contrast then with now, as we find ourselves dealing with sequester-induced defense cuts and withdrawal from wars of questionable value. Does North Korea perceive that the US is vulnerable? Add the Korea-Iran scientific-cooperation pact (Wall St. Journal, March 8) and you have missile and nuclear collaboration between two dangerous parties. We think the risk on the Korean Peninsula in 2013 is much higher than it was in the 1980s. Is the recent behavior of North Korea bluster and nothing more? If yes, global monetary policy will prevail and markets will head higher. If no - if shooting breaks out - markets are in for a jolt. Essentially, 80 to 85 percent of the capital markets of the world are now involved with or linked to one of the G4 currencies. The policy among all the managers of those currencies is to be stimulative, expansive as to central bank activities, and focused on a short-term interest rate near zero. This is a truly global phenomenon. We have long maintained that when the use of money has no cost (a zero interest rate); asset prices have an upward bias. We see that now in stock markets around the world, in the recovery of real estate, and in other asset classes as well. The dilemma that confronts an investor is whether to (a) wait for a pullback and enter the market, (b) sit on the sidelines and possibly miss a very large upward move in asset prices, or (c) commit at new, high levels, with trepidation. Last week, we covered 10,000 miles visiting clients, consultants, and referring professionals in several US locations. It was quite a week. At each stop, we found investors and their agents trying to determine what action to take. Rarely did we see them fully invested. Many suggested that a correction would create an entry opportunity and they would be buyers in such circumstances. Many are bewildered at the intensity of the rise in stock markets in the US and elsewhere. Many do not know what to do. The global central bank policy of a zero interest rate has created a platform unlike anything seen in the modern era. Investors have to determine whether they can accept central bank policies that are likely to be in place for a considerable additional period of time. The longer investors wait, the harder it will be for them to make a move into markets. Meanwhile, the pressures will mount for central banks to alter policy and change direction. They, too, are not sure what to do; but as central bankers they can hardly say so. On the stock market side, Cumberland remains fully invested in a selection of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We are deployed into sectors, industries, and broad-based ETFs in ways that will let us capture the upward bias of these markets. FOR TODAY we are fully invested. We will again emphasize the words for today. In an event-driven world, "for today" must be part of the conversation. As long as this existing central bank policy continues to unfold, markets will have an upward bias. However, if central banks act in any way to create a disorderly exit strategy, Cumberland fears there will then be a shock. The idea now is to patiently experience the present upward bias in assets worldwide. Do so nervously and with uncertainty. And thoughtfully start to rebalance early and be ahead of what may be a big shock in the future. At Cumberland, we remain fully invested on the stock market side and are gradually hedging duration or using barbells on the bond side, with emphasis on spread product rather than US Treasuries. The stock side can change any day or may not change for months. Zero interest rates are ubiquitous worldwide and very bullish for all asset prices, including global stock markets. The bond strategic-change process takes months. We believe we have months to work with, since the Federal Reserve has committed itself repeatedly to a prolonged period of very low interest rates. Also, increasing geopolitical risks result in the driving of global money flows into the US dollar, and that helps the Fed keep the Treasury yield curve at low interest rates for all maturities. We leave on Sunday for Paris and then on to Dubai. All meetings in Paris are private. In Dubai, besides private discussions, we will take part in one public forum, and we are excited about it. GIC has teamed with Wharton for a conference. See www.interdependence.org for the full schedule.† Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher is scheduled to keynote. My friend John Silvia and I are the discussants. My slides will be on the Cumberland website after my return. We fly back to New York from Dubai on March 27 and are scheduled to discuss our findings on Bloomberg Surveillance with Sara Eisen, Scarlet Fu, and Tom Keene. That will be from 6 to 7 AM New York time on March 28. We will try to send some notes along the way.
AP ImagesWhoops.¬† A Swiss financial adviser accidentally mailed a list of clients he was helping to skirt U.S. taxes, a missive that subsequently found its way to the hands of the U.S. government,¬†according to Bloomberg. Beda Singenberger¬†was said to have visited his clients in the U.S., delivering cash from their undeclared accounts or taking cash back to deposit in Switzerland. Authorities have since rounded up an 83-year-old exile from Nazi Germany and a retired U.S. Army surgeon. Over an 11-year period, Singenberger allegedly helped 60 people in the U.S. hide $184 million in secret offshore accounts with...interesting...names like Real Cool Investments Ltd. and Wanderlust Foundation, Bloomberg said. U.S. authorities have been blitzing Swiss tax shelterees since 2009, when they launched a major suit against UBS. Read the full story on Bloomberg &gt;
The Business Roundtable has published the results of its latest CEO survey. And the overall sentiment is bullish. ìCEOs foresee somewhat better economic performance for the next six months, with improved expectations for sales and capital expenditures,î said Jim McNerney, Chairman of Business Roundtable. ìThe relatively smaller improvement in the outlook for hiring, however, may reflect ongoing uncertainty and a wait-and-see attitude about the business climate in the United States, as agreement on the nationís debt and budgetary issues remains elusive." The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Survey Index jumped to 81.0 in Q1 from 65.6 in Q4 of 2012.† The long-term average is 79.2. Here's a summary of the survey: Business Roundtable
(nz)dave / FlickrDeutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna takes stock of today's strong retail sales report. While the retail sales gains are impressive, it is even more so in light of the rise in gas prices, increase in taxes, delayed tax refunds and widespread inclement weather in February. The retail sales data point to consumers' resilience, and as a result we are marking up our Q1 forecast for consumer spending from 1.5% to 2.5%. This will significantly lift GDP growth in the quarter, but we are waiting to see the business inventory data later this morning before we officially revise our forecast.

Dr. Ed's BlogStocks arenít as cheap as they were during the summer of 2011, when the forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 fell to 10.4. It is now back up to 13.5. However, there is a widespread consensus among our accounts that stocks remain relatively cheap. I agree. Thatís especially true now that several of the apocalyptic scenarios that weighed on valuation over the past three years seem less likely. Yet, at the same time, top Fed officials have explicitly stated that they intend to keep short-term rates near zero for a while even if the labor markets continue to improve. What about Tobinís q? It is a measure of the market value of an asset relative to its replacement cost. When values rise sharply relative to replacement cost that can signal a bubble as it did at the tail end of the 1990s bull market in technology stocks. For stocks, Tobinís q peaked at a record high of 1.8 back then during Q1-2000. At the end of last year, it was just below 1.0 at 0.9. Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Eye of the Beholder.

Flickr/lululemonathleticaThis is big. One of the most anticipated numbers in awhile has beat expectations. February retail sales were the first month that we were going to see the full impact of the end of the payroll tax holiday, and there was a lot of concern that the consumer was going to be sapped. Michael Block of Phoenix Partners has the summary: Nice Retail Sales number.† Headline 1.1% vs. 0.5% consensus, ex Autos 1.0% vs. +0.5%, Control Group +0.4% vs. +0.2%.† Prior month revised higher.† What was strong?† Auto parts, Building Materials, Gas Stations, Miscellaneous, Non store retailers.† Weak - Electronics, Sporting Goods, Dept Stores, Restaurants.† This is a big boost for the U.S. centric growth story.† So much for earnings and comps already telling us what we need to know.

Pete Souza (Official White House Photograph)Barack Obama did an interview with George Stephanopoulos on the debt and and budget talks that are happening now. The transcript is here. There are probably two big headlines to come out of it. One is that the two sides are too far apart for a grand bargain. The other is that Obama says there's no immediate debt crisis. The latter is the most controversial because people will say Obama is in denial, but it's objectively true. Borrowing costs are very low, and for the next several years, deficits are likely to be at what people call "sustainable" levels (levels that aren't bigger than nominal GDP growth). These comments from Obama, for example, are spot on: Well, theñ you know, those are still tough. But the conversations are still takiní place. Andñ and part of whatñ Iímñ Iím tryiní to encourage Congress to think about is yes, weíve got some big disagreements on the budget. But weíve made some big cuts. Thereís notñ in any wayñ an immediate crisis with respect toñ our finances.† The economy is growing. And, you know, there may be disagreements that we canít bridge right nowñ when it comes to financial situation. Iím hopeful that we can. But letís not have this crisis mentality stall all the other progress that needs to be made to helpñ Americans find jobs, help Americans grow the economy.† Iíllñ Iíll give you an example. We should be helping Americans refinance their homes right now. The housing marketís finally recovering. Weíve got an opportunity where evñ every American out there could get up to $3,000 in, basically, found money just by refinancing from high rates to low rates. Thatís like a massive tax cut for millions of Americans that would go to businesses, help create theñ the climate where peñ employers wanna hire more. The only thing thatís holding us back is Congress hasnít authorized it yet. Those are the kind of things that we should be able to do and do right away, even if we donít solve every otherñ disagreement that weíve got on. And here's what he says about the balanced budget. He says the main way Clinton balanced the budget is fast growth, and that pursuing a balanced budget just for a balanced budget's sake is pointless. ...Look, balancing the budget in part depends on how fast you grow. You rememberñ you were in the Clinton administration. The reason that you guys balanced it was a combination of some tax hikes, some spending cuts, and the economy grew.† And, soñ you know, my goal is not to chaseñ a balanced budget just for the sake of balance. My goal is how do we grow the economy, put people back to work, and if we do that weíre gonna be bringiní in more revenue. If weíve controlled spending and weíve got a smart entitlement package, then potentially what you have is balance. But itís not balance on the backs of, you know, the poor, the elderly, students who need student loans, families whoíve got disabled kids. Thatís not the right way to balance. This is all solid stuff: There's no debt crisis, pursuing a balanced budget just for the sake of a balanced budget is silly, and ultimately what's needed is growth. Note that the Democrats will be coming out with a budget plan today, and it won't get the U.S. to a balanced budget.
Reuters/David GrayChina's rapid economic growth rate has helped create problems that are very unique to China. Its emphasis on speed over safety, poor environmental track record, use of substandard construction materials, harsh regulations, and the propaganda aimed at protecting the image of the Communist party, are all part of the problem. Couples are getting divorced to avoid taxes, buildings and bridges have collapsed, and dead pigs are floating around in rivers. We identified 29 strange things that have happened in China because of economic and political governance.

Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple is facing many issues and challenges, all of which we have described in detail here. But, importantly, at ~$425, these problems are already "in the stock"--meaning that most investors have recognized and adjusted for them. At ~$425, moreover, Apple's stock appears to be cheap. The company now has about $150 billion in cash ($137 billion as of December 31), which means that Apple's business itself is only valued at about $250 billion. That's less than 2X revenue--for a company that is still coining money. Even if you assume that Apple's revenue growth will pause and Apple's profit margin will drop sharply--both of which appear likely to happen--the stock still looks attractive. Don't think so? Think about it this way: If you came up with $400 billion to buy all of Apple, you would be able to drop all of Apple's $150 billion cash in your pocket. This means that, on a net basis, you would only have spent $250 billion. Then you would own a business that generated a staggering ~$40 billion of cash last year. Even if you assume that competitive pressure will cause this cash-generation to get cut in half, the company will still generate $20 billion of cash per year. So you would get all of your cash back within 10-15 years...and you would still own the company. The only way Apple stock is expensive at this price is if the company has begun an inexorable and devastating decline, like Palm, BlackBerry, or Nokia. Given the industry that Apple operates in, this horror-scenario is perfectly plausible--there's plenty of precedent for it (including at Apple). But, at least for now, it doesn't seem likely. So, at $425, Apple's stock seems cheap. But there is still one thing that likely has to happen before the stock sees a sustainable recovery. Wall Street analysts have to throw in the towel. Most stock collapses follow a similar pattern. We've run through almost that whole progression on Apple. But we haven't quite reached the end. Apple's stock has collapsed, Apple's fundamentals have deteriorated, and analysts have cut their price targets. But, as yet, few analysts have downgraded and fully brought their forecasts into line with the new Apple reality. And that likely has to happen before Apple finally bottoms and turns up. Specifically, most analysts still rate the stock "buy," and the consensus earnings forecast for 2013 is for earnings to grow about 10% over last year. Apple itself has projected that its earnings will fall about 15%-25% this quarter. So projecting 10% earnings growth for the year seems pretty heroic at this point. So those earnings estimates still likely have to come down. And, at some point soon, we should start seeing some apocalyptic assessments and downgrades. Then, assuming Apple doesn't actually follow in the footsteps of Palm, we should be all set for the recovery.
A couple weeks ago the UK got its credit rating downgraded. In the wake of that, we argued that Prime Minister David Cameron had to do the hardest thing any politician would ever have to do in the wake of a downgrade: Say he was wrong and spend more money. But Cameron (and his finance minister Osborne) have no plans to reverse the ship, taking a "beatings will continue until morale improves" approach to the economy. In a new FT piece, Martin Wolf absolutely eviscerates Cameron. These two paragraphs are some of the sharpest, best writings against misguided austerity we've seen. Mr Cameron argues that those who think the government can borrow more ìthink thereís some magic money tree. Well, let me tell you a plain truth: there isnít.î This is quite wrong. First, there is a money tree, called the Bank of England, which has created £375bn to finance its asset purchases. Second, like other solvent institutions, governments can borrow. Third, markets deem the government solvent, since they are willing to lend to it at the lowest rates in UK history. And, finally, markets are doing this because of the structural financial surpluses in the private and foreign sectors. Again, Mr Cameron notes that ìlast monthís downgrade was the starkest possible reminder of the debt problem we faceî. No, it is not, for three reasons. First, Moodyís stressed that the big problem for the UK was the sluggish economic growth in the medium term, which austerity has made worse. Second, the rating of a sovereign that cannot default on debt in its own currency means little. Third, the reason for believing long-term interest rates will rise is expectations of high inflation and so higher short-term rates. But such a shift is going to follow a recovery, which would make austerity effective and timely. There is so much in the two paragraphs above that if you understand them, you'll know more than 99.9 percent of the population about the debate. Wolf is right on that the existence of the Bank of England means the government has far more ability to spend than a country lacking its own central bank. He's also right that the U.K. deficit is the flipside of a massive amount of private sector surpluses (savings) which need to go somewhere (U.K. government bonds). And Cameron's takeaway from the Moody's downgrade is 100 percent wrong. Just as the S&amp;P downgrade of the U.S. had no impact on U.S. borrowing costs, same for Moody's downgrade of the U.K. The message is to grow the economy. That's the U.K.'s key problem, not borrowing. As we noted yesterday, when David Cameron first came into power with an austerity agenda, he was praised by many centrist pundits for making hard decisions. Now it's ending in shambles, but he can't bring himself to turn things around.
Another awful European economic datapoint. Industrial production fell 0.4% in January. It was expected to decline by just 0.1%. From the report: In January 2013 compared with December 2012, seasonally adjusted industrial production fell by 0.4% in both the euro area (EA17) and the EU272, according to estimates released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. In December 20123 production grew by 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. In January 2013 compared with January 20124, industrial production decreased by 1.3% in the euro area and by 1.7% in the EU27. Ultimately not much new. The economy is bad. Eurostat
It's pretty clear that Obama's post-election high is waning. A new Wapo-ABC poll confirms some other polls which show The president's approval is on the decline, a fact that won't help him in fights with the GOP. The first two questions concerning the poll relate directly to him. The first is general approval. The second is approval on handling the economy. Both show a few point dip in approval and a jump in disapproval from when the poll was last conducted in January. WaPo-ABC WaPo-ABC Importantly, a majority still feel that at least for them personally, the economy has begun to recover. WaPo-ABC † Check out the full poll here &gt;
Wikimedia CommonsYesterday we got the Paul Ryan budget. It involved big tax cuts, eliminating Obamacare, and big cuts to virtually all categories of spending. Today it's the Democrats' turn. The Democrats will introduce their first formal "budget" in 4 years at a press conference at 10:30. Erik Wasson at The Hill reports on what will be in it: The first budget from Senate Democrats in four years includes nearly $1 trillion in new taxes but would not balance the budget. The blueprint unveiled by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on Tuesday to her Democratic colleagues would also turn off the next nine years of the sequester and replace those spending cuts with a 50-50 mix of tax increases and spending cuts. A key thing is that the Democrats are going to get panned for never getting to "balance" as Paul Ryan says he does in 10 years. And though it's true that a balanced budget sounds nice politically, it's economically pointless as Evan Soltas explained at Bloomberg View yesterday. As long as the deficit is lower than nominal GDP growth in the year, the total national debt is shrinking relative to the size of the economy. And for traditional measures of debt sustainability, that's what matters.
American Enterprise InstituteMorgan Stanley economist Vincent ReinhartOne of the big themes of 2013 is the end of the US economic crisis. That's not to say that the economy is incredibly strong (GDP growth remains mediocre and unemployment is too high) but several of the key conditions that characterized the financial crisis, and the ensuing years, are starting to fade. The household deleveraging process, for example, is almost done. That's coinciding with a beginning of real interest rate normalization. In financial markets, we're seeing an end to the risk-on-risk-off situation, and more dispersion among stocks. One of the first firms to jump on board this idea was Goldman, which made its big call that things would start to normalize in 2013, particularly the back half (and now Goldman thinks it's possible that it's happening already). Others have jumped on board too. In a new note, Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart talks about the coming inflection point for the US economy, and he also talks about the change coming in the second half of the year. In the Morgan Stanley forecast for the US, the trajectory of economic activity marks an inflection point midway through 2013. The severe financial crisis of 2008-09 necessitated significant downward adjustments by the private sector to the levels of aggregate demand and efficient supply. As the event recedes further into history, however, the drag on growth from these ongoing level adjustments plays out. In our forecast, the expansion of real GDP steps up to around 2-3/4 percent in the second half of this year and beyond. Indeed, the resilience of the private sector in our market economy probably would have been more evident by now had not Washington politics intruded. Uncertainty about fiscal policy last year and the reality of budget consolidation this year places the US currently in the middle of three quarters in which real GDP growth averages about 1 percent. Reinhart, along with his famous economist wife Carmen Reinhart, have done a lot of work on† post-financial crisis economies, which they say are weak for 3 reasons: household deleveraging, banks cleaning up their balance sheets, and the introduction of new rules and capital regulations imposed by government. But economies don't stay weak forever. In this note, Reinhart shows this chart, which shows that eventually, the post-crisis economic malaise does fade. We're getting to the point where the impact should be zero, and will still keep improving. Morgan Stanley So overall, Reinhart is consistent with what others are saying. The deleveraging is coming to an end. The private sector is normalizing. The crisis is over.
Have you been waiting around to "buy the dip" on this latest stock market rally? You've been waiting a long time. Dan Greenhaus at BTIG puts the current rally in perspective, noting that it's been 78 trading days since the last 5% correction. We're getting towards one of the longest post-crisis rallies. ¬†What the chart shows is that the current rally, 78 trading days since the end of the last 5% pullback, is at the upper end of the range during the current recovery. That doesn‚Äôt mean it cannot continue of course but it is just another observation worth passing along, suggesting that at least some breather would be welcome. From our client‚Äôs perspective though, we‚Äôre hearing that the sell-side has been talking about a pullback for a few percentage points now (we‚Äôre at roughly 2%). ‚ÄúThe market wants to go higher and higher it will go‚Äù we‚Äôre told. Maybe so but nothing lasts forever and after a rally of this duration, of this magnitude, recent history suggests digestion. BTIG
Polycart via flickrMarkets are generally lower around the world. China fell 0.99% in its session. Japan registered its second straight down day, falling 0.6%. In Europe, Italy is off 0.44%. US futures are basically flat. The big story of the day that will be coming up will be the retail sales report out in February, which should give us one of our first clean looks at the consumer now that the Payroll Tax Holiday has ended. That report comes out at 8:30 AM ET. Also the Democrats unveil their budget today.
