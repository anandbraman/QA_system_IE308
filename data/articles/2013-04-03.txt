RedfinEconomists have been getting increasingly bullish about the housing market.  In fact, Robert Shiller has warned that some housing markets already look "frothy". All of those cities also feature on Redfin's list of Real Estate Flash Sales â€“ places where homes are sold within 24 hours of being listed. Click here to jump straight to the photos &gt; In a five-month span, 78 homes sold within 24 hours in San Jose. The San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area has a median home price of $630,000, according to the latest data from Fiserv/Case-Shiller. Redfin agent Ashley Rabello who has been involved in 10 flash sales told us that she previously saw flash sales during the bust as people rushed to get good deals or sellers were in trouble and trying to exit as soon as possible. "At the moment buyers are taking advantage of the low interest rates, and as long as there are incentives to buy, we will see steady demand," she told Business Insider. "However, as more and more sellers learn how opportunistic the market is and decide to sell their home the supply in most markets will increase, and the amount of flash sales and competition may plateau." Here is a virtual tour of one such home in Meadowlands, San Jose that sold for $1.12 million.
LearjetIt's tax time, and most Americans are trying to figure how much they owe the IRS. Still, many corporations and wealthy individuals have already prepared for the big day by assiduously spending money in deliberate ways to minimize their tax liability.Â  The result is billions in lost revenue for the government every year.Â  These are just some of the most galling tax deductions that are perfectly legal.Â 
Markets are lower early in the Asian trading session. Japan's Nikkei is down 1.8 percent. Korea's Kospi is down 0.9 percent. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX is down by 0.6 percent. Considering North Korea's threat to use nuclear weapons, you would think that markets would be exhibiting much more volatility. But the relatively sanguine mood just goes to show how serious the markets are taking North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un. SBS/CNBC reporter Chery Kang, who is based in Seoul, attributed today's early sell-off to a combination of disappointing U.S. economic data, uncertainty regarding the Bank of Japan's interest rate meeting, and the threats out of North Korea. Earlier, Stifel Nicolaus' Dave Lutz argued that the sell-off in the U.S. markets wasn't just about the North Korea.  He said that if it was, we would see South Korea's stock markets tank and credit default swaps surge, which didn't happen.

REUTERS / Yuya ShinoHaruhiko KurodaThe Bank of Japan is in its first monetary policy meeting with new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the helm. It's a momentous event because Kuroda will implement the monetary policy aspects of "Abenomics" that will do the heavy lifting in helping Japan overcome more than a decade of deflation. So, everyone has been waiting for this meeting â€“ and they have a long list of things they expect Kuroda to announce. Given how far the yen has already depreciated and Japanese stocks have risen, though, most analysts agree that the outcome of tonight's meeting is already being discounted by markets. The question is this: could Kuroda do something even more aggressive than what is already priced in? Citi analyst Steven Englander says the Bank of Japan has "strong incentives" to be aggressive at this meeting in giving markets a positive surprise. He points to the chart below, which shows that the Japanese Nikkei's correlation with the yen is close to record highs, while the Nikkei's correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is near lows. Citi In other words, the weak yen is a lot more important for the Nikkei right now than a strong S&amp;P 500. This means, says Englander, that the weakening yen "has been doing double duty in terms of restoring competitiveness and generating a feel-good wealth effect" in Japan. "To us this signals that the BoJ faces strong incentives to keep the Japanese yen weak, so as to maintain the joint benefits from competitiveness and the wealth effects," says Englander. "While it is possible that they have not had enough time to draft a program or overcome BoJ board resistance, there is likely also a penalty to creating ambiguity among investors on how committed the BoJ is to moving aggressively to hit its targets." According to Bloomberg, Kuroda may hold a press conference following the meeting at 2:30 AM ET. The BoJ's interest rate announcement could come any time between now and then.

Last month, Lululemon recalled 17 percent of its pants for being too sheer.Â  The incident blew the door wide open for Lululemon's mounting competition, cost the company millions of dollars, and resulted in the resignation of its chief product officer.Â  In a release today, Lululemon explained why so many of its pants were recalled.Â  "We have found that our testing protocols were incomplete for some of the variables in fabric characteristics," the company said. "When combined with subtle style changes in pattern, the resulting end product had an unacceptable level of sheerness." In other words, Lululemon wasn't thoroughly testing the product it was putting out.Â  The company initially blamed the problem on its supplier in Taiwan. The supplier fired back that it wasn't responsible. Lululemon is implementing a new team and policies to keep the problem from happening again. It's important that Lululemon take action: the sheer pants scandal was its fourth quality-control issue in the past year. If consumers don't trust Lululemon, they'll likely go to competitors like Athleta for their yoga-wear.Â 
REUTERS / Toru HanaiKikuo Iwata, Haruhiko Kuroda, Hiroshi NakasoThis is it – the moment the Abenomics-watchers have been waiting for. Wednesday night, the Bank of Japan will conclude its first monetary policy meeting with new BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the helm. So far, Japan's great "Abenomics" experiment – which seeks to employ bold policy tools to overcome more than a decade of deflation – has been mostly talk. Now, the rubber meets the road for Kuroda, the monetary policy dove selected by recently-elected Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to lead the charge from the BoJ, which has to do a lot of the heavy lifting. There are a few things everyone is looking for, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Deutsche Bank – an increase in the size of the Bank of Japan's quantitative easing program, a directive to start buying longer-dated bonds as part of those asset purchases, a cut in the interest rate the central bank pays on excess reserves, and stepped-up purchases of risk assets like ETFs. Below is what BAML analysts Shogo Fujita, Masayuki Kichikawa and Shuichi Ohsaki predict for Kuroda's meeting. Announcement of early introduction of an open-ended framework (FY13).  A suggestion of a forward-guidance framework. (such as “easing to continue until a 2% inflation target is feasibly attainable”) Announcement of elimination of the banknote rule and unification of JGB purchases through the APP and rinban operations. (We expect the APP will be maintained for risk assets, integration will depend on the construction of procedural systems i.e. will not be immediate)  Extension of the central JGB purchasing zone to longer maturities (with the shift to full rinban this is fully expected, extension to 10 years, plus small rinban increases in the 10- to 30-year range expected, the BoJ may defer announcement of details/technicalities for a later date).  After unification of JGB purchasing operations, an increase in the current monthly purchase amount from slightly under ¥5tn to ¥10tn (possibly with a move to net purchase targets like the FRB, implementations and details may come at a later date).  Announce gradual elimination of fixed-term funding operations. (A shift to JGB purchases likely. This would make it unnecessary to lower the IOER. Implementations and details may come at a later date.)  Announcement of the BoJ’s intention to increase purchases of risk assets such as such as ETF, J-REIT, corporate bonds, and CP. (Details to be provided at a later date, but the BoJ’s capital will have to be reinforced or BoJ will have to receive a government guarantee against losses if it is to increase risk asset purchases. We believe the most credible option is for the APP to handle only risk assets and for the government to provide a first-loss guarantee scheme for the APP up to a certain amount.)  Deutsche Bank analyst Makoto Yamashita says the market will "hinge on the details" of the meeting. "We expect BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to emphasize a regime shift at the Bank, which is likely to become a catalyst for yen depreciation and a rise in stocks," says Yamashita. That would be welcome news for investors betting against the yen, which is expected to continue falling as a result of Abenomics policy initiatives, but has found a bit of support in recent weeks, effectively stalling one of the most popular currency trades in the world. However, most agree that the market is already expecting so much of Kuroda and the BoJ that the outcome of this press conference has probably already been discounted. "The market is already positioned for boldness, with the largest speculative short JPY position since the heyday of the yen-funded carry trade in mid-2007, according to CFTC data," says Société Générale analyst Alvin Tan. "We remain on the sidelines in JPY for the short-term." Deutsche Bank strategist Taisuke Tanaka agrees. "The markets have largely discounted these possibilities," Tanaka writes in a note to clients today. "Thus, we believe the new regime's decision will not spark a second 'Abe market' (i.e., a repeat of the market upsurge following the election victory of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) and may disappoint markets." On the other hand, Citi strategist Steven Englander says the BoJ has a strong incentive to surprise markets today, given the correlation breakdown between Japanese stocks and the S&amp;P 500. According to Bloomberg, Kuroda may hold a press conference Thursday at 2:30 AM ET following the conclusion of the central bank's meeting on monetary policy.
Her last day is April 15, according to a brief statement released by the company.Â She's been overseeing product at the yoga company since 2008.Â  The statement didn't say who will replace her.Â  The company recalled its luon yoga pants last month for being too sheer. The incident was the fourth quality-control issue that Lululemon has had in the past year.Â  Analysts blame the problems on Lululemon's quick expansion and lack of control over its supply chain.Â  But the issues come at a time when Lululemon is facing unprecedented competition from other retailers like Gap's Athleta.Â  While the recent sheer yoga pants recall is the most visible gaffe for Lululemon, longtime customers complained that product quality hasn't been the same in recent years.Â  But much of the criticism has been focused on CEO Christine Day.Â  "Day has ruined everything special about Lululemon. The bullet proof quality, the fit, the femininity, the lululemoness of the product," Carolyn Beauchesne, author of the blog Lululemon Addict, wrote last month.Â 
The EU has been feeding the corrupt PIIGS (find a spot for a C in there for Cyprus) everybody else's tax money, and it has done so knowingly and willingly - well, either that or blindingly stupidly-. Now that the loot has been divvied up, everybody else gets to pay a second time. Or so is the plan. Which will fail.   So what's happening in Italy 5 weeks after the elections? The short answer is: not much. They haven't been able to patch together a new government, because various parties refuse to form a coalition with various others. Leftie Bersani refused rightie Berlusconi's advances, and outside-the-system Beppe Grillo, as he's said all along, refuses to work with any and all of them. Which is why a few days ago President Napolitano threw together a team of 10 advisers who are supposed to tell him how to make things work after all. Since there is no feasible coalition between existing parties, they will probably as a last resort advise him to try a technocrat government of one kind or another. That will not be appreciated, because many Italians will argue that they might as well hold on to the Monti technophiles while the next elections are being prepared. Things have changed since Monti was pushed forward, and a second Wall Street/IMF/World Bank made man could lead to anarchy, not smooth sailing. Interesting to see that the 10 men adviser group has people from the leftie and rightie factions (as well as lawyers etc.), but none from Grillo's Five Star M5S. Also interesting is that Napolitano has left one option undiscussed: M5S have offered to form a government, which might survive with the support of Bersani. Word is that Grillo hasn't even rejected being prime minister himself. The President's term expires May 15. Parliament will have to elect a new president, with a possible first presidential vote as early as April 18. But whoever's followed Italy over the past few months can easily understand how hard that vote will be. It's absolutely possible that not only will there be no government in place 6 weeks from now, but that beyond that there'll be no-one left to mediate the process either. While Berlusconi and Bersani want old and corrupt political stalwarts for president (Romano Prodi?!), Beppe Grillo has suggested Gino Strada, a celebrated war surgeon operating in global combat zones who's been vocal in rejecting Rome's support for several NATO operations including the invasion of Afghanistan. Apparently ECB chief Mario Draghi did make a phone call to Napolitano, telling him, no doubt, to stay the course and make sure there's going to be a euro-friendly government (no Grillo!). Trouble for Draghi - and Merkel and Brussels - is, Napolitano, an 86-year old former communist, has nothing to lose. He can bide his time while no solution is found, and tell Grillo to form a government anyway, ideally one week or so before his term is up. One thing Napolitano cannot do, because his term is almost up, is dissolve parliament.   Cyprus? Let's see..., a 2-week old government that cut a deal with the troika. A little over a week later, the Finance minister responsible for the deal has resigned and president Anastasiades' son in law stands accused of transferring €21 million out of Laiki Bank to a UK bank one week prior to the deal (along with at least 100 other well connected savers). Less than a week after the bailout deal was announced, Cyprus was handed extra time to implement the deal's measures, and depositors are cut for much higher percentages than "estimated". This is a set pattern, not an unfortunate course of events. It's like Groucho's line: "These are my principles!. And if you don't like them, I have others...". Turns out, the entire deal was a con game from the get go, and the entire eurozone is well on its way there too. The IMF "gives" €1 billion because Cyprus has such a great set of economic "reform" measures, i.e. fire who you can, cut pensions and benefits where you can, raise taxes and sell your most valuable public assets. Cypriots have no idea what's going to hit them. Oh, and the president announced that a casino will be opened soon. Michalis Sarris, the Finance minister who brokered the troika deal and resigned, had a 30-odd year career at World Bank, and has an earlier term in the same post from September 2005 till March 2008. He was also a longtime non-executive chairman at Laiki Bank during the time it made the investments that brought it down, and became more actively involved at the bank in 2012 to "cleanse" it in order to comply with the troika bailout. Either a man who knows how to get the job done or a man who raises a few suspicions, take your pick.   You know, and this is not the first time I argue the point, the EU and the euro could well have been successful; just not with the one-dimensional-thinking religious zealots that make up its present leadership structure. There's nothing wrong with European unity in itself. But that one dimension - i.e. the refusal to discuss anything other than pushing forward with "the project" despite serious and reasonable doubts and questions - is not a minor flaw, it's a fatal one. If you want to make something work, you will always have to leave space for - thinking about - the possibility that it won't. Brussels does no such thing. That right there is the seed that breeds inevitable failure. The EU has resorted to trampling its weakest members. That's not something that started with Cyprus, it's merely the next step in the process. "Official policy", as dictated entirely by the richest member states, could from the very beginning only have worked in times of unbridled wealth and growth, since these would have temporarily kept inbuilt flaws from view. As soon as the financial crisis first reared its head in 2006/2007, though, this game was up. From then on in the EU as a governing body has started to react as your own body would do if for instance you were exposed to extreme cold for a prolonged period of time (hypothermia). That is, in order to save the core, blood flow to the extremities (in the EU case, the peripheral countries) would be cut off, eventually resulting in the amputation of toes and fingers. The Roman empire didn't fall because of just one cause, but this hypothermia-like dynamic certainly played a big role. The more Rome resorted to squeezing the peripheral regions to maintain its own wealth, the more resistance it encountered. Until the periphery sacked the entire empire. The best, or make that the only, advice for southern European countries is Get Out! before you're liquidated as so many frozen gangrenous digits. If you don't, the moment will inevitable come when the core accuses you of infecting it with life threatening afflictions, thereby morally justifying to itself unceremoniously dumping you in the great azure yonder. The people of Italy, Cyprus and Spain should neither be seen nor treated as mere essentially disposable extremities, but the way the EU was first set up and then governed made it inevitable that they would be at the first sight of adversity. And since these countries don't have the political power to affect the necessary changes in Brussels and Frankfurt, their only option is to quit. Or be suffocated completely, but there is no way all PIIGS plus Cyprus (and add a second S for Slovenia) will accept that, because southern Europe is as loaded with historic pride and independent spirit as it is with corruption. There's no way there won't be a first country that will elect to leave the eurozone. And it'll be all dominoes all the way down from there. Sure, it hasn't happened yet, though I've said for years it would. But has anyone seen the manufacturing numbers for Europe, including the core countries, this week? The entire European economy is falling like a stone, and the worse it gets, the more the core will attempt to squeeze the periphery. At some point it will become clear that there are only 3 core nations left (Germany, the Netherlands, Finland), and 14 peripheral ones. And then the periphery will start doing the squeezing. That is what we should all really start being afraid of, for there be the seeds of bloodshed. And that blood will spill around the world.
Mt. Gox, the world's first and largest Bitcoin exchange, appears to be down. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like for us when we try to access the site. We are seeing a lot of others tweeting about the same problem. aaand Mt Gox goes down mtgox.com These outages highlight the fundamental problem with the virtual currency that has seen its price surge in 2013 – confidence. ConvergEx Group strategist Nick Colas touched on this in a recent note about Bitcoin: What’s interesting to note is why BTC prices plummet, which they did in the back half of 2011. The cause was a very short-lived hack attack on one Bitcoin “Wallet” company out of Japan, which caused the price to drop from $27 down to $2 in a few months. Confidence in money as a store of value is the ultimate driver of its value, both in the cyber and real worlds. These are definitely key issues that will need to be overcome if Bitcoin wants to go mainstream. mtgox.com
What happens when a country emerges from deflation? Memories of the conquest of inflation are still fresh, but for examples of the reverse we must go back to the 1930s. Japan was one of the first to reflate successfully, thanks to Korekiyo Takahashi, finance minister from 1931 to 1936. His programme involved taking the country off the gold standard and issuing large amounts of bonds to be bought by the central bank. In today’s terms it combined fiscal stimulus, quantitative easing and currency depreciation. The effect was dramatic. Under Takahashi, national income rose 60 per cent while consumer prices rose 18 per cent. The debt-to-GDP ratio stabilised while stocks doubled. According to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Takahashi “brilliantly saved Japan from the world depression”. But there was no happy ending. At the age of 82 he was assassinated by officers enraged by his “exit strategy” of cutting military spending. Reflation should have been withdrawn but inflation soared under the aegis of irresponsible militarists. The lesson of Takahashi-nomics is that reflation can take hold quickly if policy makers are determined. 1. One wonders whether Bernanke, in his heart, would preferred a far more aggressive and consistent bond-buying program the past four years. If so, did he refrain because he felt the Fed lacked the political capital with Congress to do so? Who knows, maybe if the Fed had pursued such a policy, he would not have been reappointed. But this episode does show just how effective monetary policy can be during financial crisis. 2. Of course, the more severe Bernanke critics will see his praise of the pro-inflation Japanese central banker as evidence the Fed will enable the Obama Democrats to inflate away the massive US federal debt rather than cutting spending. 3. More evidence that when a central bank does engage in aggressive monetary policy, exit-strategy communication is vital.

Gold's precipitous decline in recent months has garnered a lot of attention in the headlines. Of course, gold is only a single commodity in an asset class that had, for the most part, a pretty dismal first quarter of 2013. The chart below shows how the entire complex has come under fire, making the broader asset class one of the worst performers of the year so far. In a recent report on commodities, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale analysts Michael Haigh and Jesper Dannesboe sought to explain the reason for across-the-board weakness in 2013: The conditions are finally coming into place for a sustainable US economic recovery. This will provide some support for pro-cyclical commodities. However, while the US economy hasÂ arrived at â€˜recovery-friendly conditionsâ€™, Europe is not there yet, and theÂ recent acceleration inÂ Chinaâ€™s economic growth is likely to fade by mid-year as the Chinese governmentâ€™s policies toÂ rebalance the economy act as a brake. Therefore, the upside for commodity prices as a group is only moderately positive for the year and most of the upside is likely to come from energy prices. The recent sharp sell-off in base metal prices is, in our view, now overdone, and we should see a partial recovery during the second quarter. But this is unlikely to be extended into the second half of the year as Chinese economic growth should be slowing by then. Some commodities, like gasoline, actually had a pretty decent Q1. However, it's tumbled 4 percent just today as energy commodities have come under fire, and now, it's about to turn negative year-to-date, joining most other commodities in the red.

APThe North Korean army announced that it has received the final approval necessary to launch nuclear weapons on U.S. targets. From Yonhap News: In a statement, the North's supreme military command said it is formally notifying the White House and the Pentagon that "reckless operations" involving "cutting-edge" nuclear weapons have been finally approved. Most analysts put North Korea's nuclear weapons capability years away from a reliable rocket, warhead, and re-entry vehicle — all needed for a "cutting edge" strike. The KCNA statement said exactly, North Korea would attack with a "smaller, cutting edge, lighter and diversified nuclear strike." Researchers tend to agree that development of such technology would take many more tests, making the truth behind North Korea's boasts quite unlikely — though most estimates also admit that no one can be 100 percent positive the technology has not been developed.  Furthermore, this announcement is eerily similar to several others coming out of state-owned media KCNA and the North Korean administration over the past month. Perhaps it's in response to Secretary of Defense Hagel's announcement of the placement of missile defense batteries in Guam, calling North Korean rhetoric a "clear" and "present" danger. Recent military movements from the U.S. indicate the military expects a launch, but likely not nuclear. Prominent arms analyst Jeffrey Lewis told an Australian think-tank that U.S. troop mobilizations west of the peninsula indicate that a North Korean missile launch is imminent. From the Lowy Institute for International Policy: This is unacceptable. The United States, Australia, and other allies appear to be taking important policy decisions on the basis of the imminent deployment of the KN-08 [a North Korean missile]. If this is the case, they should say so directly and provide the basis for asserting the imminent deployment of the KN-08. The kicker, though, is that until recently, analysts thought these particular North Korean missiles were just a prop. Little is known about KN-08 road-mobile missile, other than from what was seen at a parade in April 2012. Analysts say it could be medium-range, or worse, an intercontinental variety. Still, they have no idea what to expect.  There's also talk about the somewhat less terrifying Musudan, which is believed to be a variant of the SCUD — a missile more fit for hitting soft-targets, like population centers, rather than taking out military targets. Recently, the Army released information about a wargame concerning the fall of Kim Jong-Un, the collapse of the government, and follow on actions to protect the estimated eight nuclear warheads in North Korean possession.
APNEW YORK CITY â€” The cooperating witness who was instrumental in theÂ alleged bribery plot that took down state Sen. Malcolm Smith, a Queens councilman and city GOP bosses is a bankrupt, smooth-talking real estate investor who personally owes a staggering $126 million to Citigroup, DNAinfo.com New York has learned. Moses "Mark" Stern, 40, brokeredÂ the backroom deals that involved $80,000 in cash payoffs and a scheme to get Smith, the Democratic senator, on the Republican ticket for this year's mayoral race, according to sources.Â  His sweet-talking and negotiations led to Tuesday's arrests of Smith,Â Councilman Dan Halloran,Â Bronx Republican party head Joseph Savino,Â Queens GOP vice-chairman Vincent TaboneÂ and two Rockland County officials. In the criminal complaint against the six defendants, Stern is never identified but only referred to as the cooperating witness, or "CW." Stern, who has a scraggly beard and wears a yarmulke, seems to have a knack for the art of persuasion. In the spring of 2007, at the height of the real estate bubble, the Monsey, N.Y., resident got Citigroup to give his firm First Republic Group Realty $126 million in mortgage loans to buy 11 strip malls in the southeast, despite his spotty track record on investments, according to court records. Â  First Republic bought the properties for $128 million but went bankrupt in 2009. That same year Citigroup sued Stern, claiming he was on the hook for all the money. The failed real estate deal also led to federal fraud charges in 2010 against the escrow agent involved in the loan transaction, according to an indictment in Manhattan Federal Court. The escrow agent is accused of lying about paying millions of dollars in closing costs.. Stern does not appear to have ever been charged. But the criminal complaint against the six political figures says the cooperating witness pleaded guilty on March 11. Stern,Â who is reportedly married with nine children, owns two properties next to one another in Monsey. One is a ramshackle home, while the other is a mansion currently under construction. People who answered the door on Tuesday night and Wednesday at the addresses declined to comment. Records show that two previous companies Stern ran, Grupo Xtra and Clothestime Stores, filed for bankruptcy. In a response to Citigroup's civil filing, Stern said in an affidavit that he didn't owe the banking giant a dime since it bought First Republic â€” and its 11 properties â€” for $1,000 at a public auction. He claimed the properties were valued at $140 million and brought in annual profits of $5 million. Still, Citigroup won a judgment against him for all the money. A lawyer who represented Stern in the civil action recently won a judgment against him for unpaid legal fees. Stern's work as a cooperating witness with federal investigators dates back to at least Aug. 5, 2011, when he and the Spring Valley, N.Y., Mayor Noramie Jasmin discussed him obtaining a parcel of town property to develop, according to the criminal complaint. The real estate project led to the arrests of Jasmin and her deputy, Joseph Desmaret, on fraud charges Tuesday. Stern went on to wheel and deal on behalf of Smith in his efforts to bribe Halloran and the party bosses for their blessing to run on the GOP ticket, according to the criminal complaint.
The Japanese Social Security system has a report out on the aging problem in Japan (Forbes link).Â  That Japan has a rapidly aging population is an old story, but the new numbers are worth considering. Japanese Work Force 2010 = 82m 2025 = 71m (-13%) 2040 â€“ 58m (-30%) Japanese Total Population 2010 = 127m 2050 = 80m (-37%) Japanese Aged Population 2010 â€“ 11% of population is 75 or older 2025 â€“ 22%+ will be &gt;75 (Double) I defy any economist to show me a road map for Japan that does not lead to crisis based on these numbers. I donâ€™t care what Abe says, or what the new head of the Central Bank, Kuroda, does. It will not matter.Â  As a country, Japan is a long-term short. Japanâ€™s pay-as-you-go Social Security system will rob future workerâ€™s paychecks. The cost of medical care for the +75 group is 5Xs that of younger citizens. Budget deficits to pay for all this will have to explode, the national debt with it. There have been dozens of rallies in the Nikkei the past 23 years. With each rally, the bulls came out and proclaimed that the bottom had been set. The current rally is no different. The thinking by many is that a new golden age for Japanese stocks is upon us. I find that hard to believe. I donâ€™t care how much money Japan prints. Those printing presses canâ€™t offset the powerful force of demographics, at least not for long.  Â  There are always different views on Wall Street. There are plenty of folks who love Japanese stocks, believe that printing money solves all problems and that demographics donâ€™t really matter at all. Time will tell.  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â  
(Source requests not to be attributed)A father and son from Austin say they've just sold their 2007 Porsche Cayman S for approximately 300 Bitcoins. That's $39,000 (not including a 0.99 percent processing fee). Blane, an IT specialist and software engineer, and his father say they sold the car last night to an anonymous buyer who cashed out his Bitcoins using the site Bitpay. (They asked us not to use their last name.) We stumbled upon their claim in a Bitcoin discussion forum, and were able to reach out to them directly via email. Blane emailed us two screenshots he says prove the transaction took place: Blane And the page they'd set up showing the car, as well as a Harley, on offer: Blane According to Blane,Â his father created a Cragslist ad for the car a couple of months ago, and there was immediate interest: ... we received a few offers on the way up, one for 1000 bitcoins when they were $26 apiece, and interest really spiked once we started nearing $100 a coin. In the end, we had four potential buyers ready to pick up the car at around 400 BTC, the first user to make their way to Austin got the car. Reached by phone, Blane'sÂ father said the buyer, who wishes to remain anonymous, is a "young businessman" not from Texas who "does a number of things, from construction to running services in the food and beverage industry."Â  He sent a surrogate to complete the transaction. From Blane:Â  ... all four of us were on the phone, me, father, buyer, and surrogate while he sent the coins. We watched the transaction make its way through the network over a span of about 30 minutes, then he signed a bill of sale and passed on the title. Â  Blane and his father described the deal as a watershed moment both for themselves and Bitcoin in general. They sayÂ they're now considering opening an online business devoted to selling cars for bitcoins. Â  The Porsche had 8,200 miles on it.Â 
FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Cheap Stocks Outperform The Stock Market Over Time (Smead Capital) Buying cheap stocks at the start of the year is a good investment strategy, according to Smead Capital.Â  "To those investors who agree that valuation matters dearly, we believe there are two choices. The first choice is to buy all 100 of the lowest quintile stocks. The other choice is to have some qualitative screens to find individual securities off of this undistinguished list.

Smead Capital Successful Investors Need To Possess Six Key Traits (Advisor Perspectives) Kendall Anderson of Anderson Griggs Investments, drawing on former NYU professor Doug Bellemore writes that for investors to be successful, they need to possess six key traits.Â  1. Patience - Investors need to identify and purchase cheap stocks and wait for five to eight years. 2. Courage - The investor should have the courage to ignore those who disagree with him/her. 3. Intelligence and common sense. 4. Emotional stability -Â  To not be overwhelmed by emotions on Wall Street and to be able to carve out the facts. 5. Hard work - Do meticulous research. 6."Willingness to sacrifice the investment protection of diversification." Two Advisors Leave Morgan Stanley For Prospera (Reuters) Stephen Shipley and John Rubottom have left Morgan Stanley Wealth Management to join independent Prospera Financial Services. The duo managed $121 million in assets. Morgan Stanley "has lost at least 68 veteran advisers who managed more than $10 billion at the firm," according to Reuters.  We Are Seeing Cracks In The Stock Market (Business Insider) Stock markets ended the first quarter on a high. But some experts say if you look below the surface, you're already beginning to see cracks. Here are some key signs from Doug Kass: 1. "The Russell 2000 underperformed on Monday (-1.3%) and was down (-0.5%) on an up day on Tuesday." 2. "The advance/decline line is eroding as the market's rise narrows." 3. "The number of new 52-week highs is narrowing." 4. "Transports trailed, down 1.5% and 1.2% on the first two days of the week, respectively -- check out the chart of FedEx (FDX)." Kass goes on to point out that it is unusual when defensive stocks lead the market during new highs. We Are Witnessing The Tulip Bubble In Real-Time (Art Cashin) UBS' Art Cashin thinks the Bitcoin craze is like the Dutch tulip bubble of the 17th century. "It is rare that we get to see a bubble-like phenomenon trade tick for tick in real time.Â  Usually it's kind of regional aggregate pricing like real estate reports.Â  But, all that may be changing â€“ before our very eyes â€“ quite literally.Â  The bubble du jour may be something called a 'Bitcoin'." Aggressive bidding for Bitcoins has caused prices to double to over $100 in two weeks. "Last night trading turned a bit whacky and the Bitcoin spiked above 145 before plunging in a few trades back to $126," wrote Cashin.Â  "Just what the world needs â€“ a "safe" currency."
Tesla Motors reached profitability for the quarter â€” a huge step for the startup â€” by urging customers who had reserved cars but not yet made their payments to do so, according to Bloomberg. Cory Johnson, editor-at-large for Bloomberg Television, obtained a March email sent by Tesla to a customer, asking for help in reaching the milestone that would help the company and those who drive its cars: Tesla is right on the cusp of profitability this quarter for the first time in 10 years since the company started. This is a huge company milestone that will not only be great for the company, but also for our customers. In order for Tesla to be able to count your Model S for the quarter, we simply need to receive payment. Johnson noted Tesla confirmed the email was accurate. Receiving payments ahead of schedule may have made Tesla profitable for the quarter â€” and given its stock price a significant bump â€” but it could leave the electric car company weak for the next quarter, since payments that would have been made in the coming months were made ahead of schedule. Here's the Bloomberg video:
via Human Events Legendary hedge fund manager George Soros has reportedly asked to withdraw a lot of money from Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management. Â  This news was buried in Juliet Chung's piece on the hedge fund war over Herbalife that appeared in the Wall Street JournalÂ on Monday: Â  A win in Herbalife also would come as Mr. Ackman is trying to raise billions in permanent investor money, which would give him more control over his investments, and as Soros Fund Management within the past several months has asked to withdraw several hundred million dollars from the $12.5 billion firm. A Soros spokesman declined to comment. Ackman has publicly declared that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products. He believes Herbalife is a pyramid scheme and has a price target of $0.Â  [Hat Tip: ValueWalk]

Reuters/ Steve MarcusAnother headache for SAC Capital founder Steve Cohen... The ex-wife of Cohen has won the reinstatement of her lawsuit against the billionaire hedge fund manager that seeks $8.25 million in damages, Bloomberg News' David Rovella reported. In 2009, Patricia Cohen filed a lawsuit against Steve Cohen allegeding that he hid millions from her during their divorce.  She alleged that some of that money had come from insider trading in RCA shares back in 1985 before it was acquired by General Electric, according to DealBook. The case was dismissed in 2011 because it was filed after legal deadlines.  An appeals court ruled that it was filed in time, according to Bloomberg.   Cohen married patricia in 1979 when he was 23 years-old.  They had two children together and got divorced in 1988.

The stock market is selling off today with the Dow down by over 100 points. But there is one sector that is in the green: defense stocks.Â  The US Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (ITA) is up 0.8 percent. This could be explained by the escalating tensions in North Korea. "North Korea rhetoric presents real, clear danger, threat to US, allies," said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel earlier today.  Here's a look at how some of the other big defense contractors are doing today. Google Finance

YouTubeLast night Italian authorities confiscated $1.6 billion worth of assets from the Italian "Lord of the Wind," energy mogul Vito Nicastri, the AFP reports. This is the largest seizure of mob-linked assets in Italian history. Authorities believe that Nicastri has ties to the mafia â€” and not just any mafia, the Sicilian crime family headed by Matteo Messina Denaro, the so-called "Boss of all Bosses." From AFP: "This is a sector in which money can easily be laundered," Arturo de Felice, head of Italy's anti-mafia agency, told news channel SkyTG24 today. "Operating in a grey area helped him build up his business over the years."... Nicastri had "numerous and high-level contacts with mafia figures" the anti-mafia agency said, adding that this had been confirmed by messages found during the arrest of two local mafia bosses. Wikimedia CommonsAs for Denaro, he's been on the World's (and Italy's) Most Wanted List for years. He's headed the Cosa Nostra since 2006 and is also known as 'Diabolik' after a cult Italian comic strip criminal. Arrest attempts in 2010 (after authorities were able to reconstruct Denaro's DNA) and in 2011 failed. Denaro's still at large, leading the mafia and still very feared despite this and other recent mafia linked asset seizures. According Sicilian paper Gazetta del Sud authorities have received information indicating that Denaro is plotting to kill a Sicilian prosecutor. From Gazetta: Details of Messina Denaro's alleged assassination plan against Palermo prosecutor Nino Di Matteo were contained in two anonymous letters sent to Palermo prosecutors a few days ago, sources said. The government has ordered Di Matteo's police protection to be beefed up. Scary stuff.
Gold crumbling is a big story that more people are talking about. As you can see in this chart from KITCO, just a few days ago, gold was still above $1600. Today it's touched $1550. Kitco What's interesting is that this is supposedly coming at a time of stress and concern about the banks (see all the Bitcoin hype). And it's also coming as the market is weak (Dow down 100 today). There's basically no story that's helping the gold bugs, and actually pretty much all of the commodity complex has been weak.
Google FinanceStocks are falling. The S&amp;P 500 is down 16 points, which is around 1.0 percent. Gold is also getting hit. According to CNBC, traders are concerned about the rising tensions in North Korea. This sell-off also comes in the wake of a disappointing ADP jobs report, which could be a bad sign for Friday's official jobs report. It's worth noting, however, that stocks are still within a handful of points of their all-time highs.
REUTERS/Keith BedfordU.S. economic data has been coming in surprisingly strong. And last Friday's better-than-expected income and consumer spending data has prompted many Wall Street economists to revise up their Q1 GDP forecasts. While some have yet to raise their official GDP targets, many have reflected the revisions in their tracking estimates, a number that gets updated continuously with each new input to GDP. This is surprising as many expected the post-financial crisis era of below trend growth to extend for many years. Here are some of the new forecasts: Deutsche Bank: +3.0 percent While Deutsche Bank's Joe Lavorgna expects 3 percent growth, he says better than expected real consumption data (one percentage point above DB's forecast) and strong construction spending could send Q1 GDP up 3.7 percent. In a tweet last week, LaVorgna said Q1 GDP could rise as much as 4 percent. While sequestration has hurt public spending, the private sector is improving. But "because some of the increase in consumption could show up in imports," he's sticking with his 3 percent call for now. Bank of America Merrill Lynch: +3.0 percent BAML analysts are tracking Q1 GDP growth of 3.4 percent after stronger retail sales, inventories, and consumer spending. JP Morgan: +3.8 percent (tracking estimate) "The latest round of data, particularly the February personal spending numbers released last Friday, suggest the economy grew quite briskly in the quarter just ended. By our estimation Q1 GDP growth now looks to be tracking around 3.8%, which would make it the third fastest quarter in the current expansion which began in mid-2009. There is still a decent amount of Q1 data to be released before the first look at GDP at the end of April, but barring some fluke we believe the quarter's growth will almost certainly print decently above-trend." Macroeconomic Advisors: +3.6 percent (tracking estimate) Macroeconomic AdvisorsGoldman Sachs: +3.4 percent (tracking estimate) There's been a significant improvement in growth since the fourth quarter, but recently ISM manufacturing index fell to 51.3 and construction spending rose 1.2 percent, only partly "retracing February's 2.1 percent decline."
So it is that Las Vegas Sands chairman Sheldon Adelson finds himself on the witness stand this week, defending his company from a former consultant who alleges he's owed millions from Las Vegas Sands after persuading Chinese government officials to permit Adelson to expand his empire. But of course, all of that only dates back to 2001 at the earliest. We wanted to take you back to the beginning, and explain how Adelson ended up at the top of the casino world. We previously alluded to his rise when we ranked him No. 13 on our Horatio Alger Index of most impressive rags-to-riches stories in America.Â  If you missed that, you'll quickly agree that he's come a long, long way.
Gold is having another rough day after yesterday's selloff. The shiny yellow metal has been trending down since around 10:15 AM, but it really took a hit in the last 15 minutes or so, dropping another $10 just since then (though now it's starting to retrace its losses a bit). The subgraph below shows the big spike in volume around that time. Right now, it's down around 1 percent on the day, trading near $1560 an ounce. Yesterday, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale put out a big report declaring the end of the era of gold. Most of the sentiment we've seen on gold lately has been negative. ThinkorswimClick to enlarge
Wikimedia CommonsOpening arguments in a $328 million lawsuit against Las Vegas Sands casino mogul Sheldon Adelson begin in Las Vegas today, says Bloomberg. At question is how Adelson built his multi-billion dollar empire in Asia, specifically in gambling hot spot, Macau. This trial really goes back to 2008 when Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman, alleged that Las Vegas Sands agreed to pay him and his associates $5 million and 2 percent of the net income from the companyâ€™s Macau casinos if they persuaded the Macau Special Administrative Region to award the company a license to operate in the former Portuguese colony in 2002. At the end of the 2008 trial, a Las Vegas jury awarded Suen $43.8 million but that decision was overturned by an appeals Court because the judge had allowed "so- called hearsay evidence" to be considered during the trial. Now Suen is seeking $98 million in past damages and $230 million in future damages based on Las Vegas Sandsâ€™s profit from its Macau casino resorts, Bloomberg reports. Suen isn't the only one suing Adelson for alleged bribery, though. Asian American Entertainment Corp. is also suing Las Vegas Sands over its dealings in Macau to the tune of $376 million. Former Sands China CEO Steven Jacobs is also suing the company, alleging that he was fired when he would not engage in inappropriate conduct and use "improper leverage" against Chinese officials. Las month, in Las Vegas Sands' latest regulatory report to the SEC, the company admitted that it may have violated anti-bribery laws.Specifically, the filing said that â€œthere were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions.â€ Now here's the thing: $376 million is a drop in the bucket to Adelson, who threw $20 million of his own personal wealth at the 2012 U.S. Presidential election without even batting an eye. Bloomberg estimates that he's the 17th richest person in world with a net worth of $26.4 billion. The Las Vegas Sands Venetian MacauWhat's really at issue here isn't money, it's Las Vegas Sands' potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The law bars American companies from bribing officials overseas for business (from the Department of Justice): ...Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of the mails or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. The Las Vegas Sands has three casinos in Macau, so if Suen wins this lawsuit, it could open the floodgates to dealings that began in 2001 when the Macau government invited bids for casino concessions for the first time.
Some market watchers like to argue that the message on the covers of widely circulated print periodicals are contrarian indicators of the market. Rather than calling it an outright contrarian indicator, the housing experts at John Burns Real Estate Consulting consulting believe it is indeed a lagging indicator. "Magazine covers tend to focus on what is happening in home prices, which is a lagging indicator," writes Rick Palacios Jr. of John Burns. "Note how Phoenix home prices were up in 2005/2006, which was the best time to sell, and down in 2011, which was the best time to buy." For now, they don't believe we're in a danger zone for housing. Below's a chart of John Burns' proprietary home price and risk indices. "When the HCRI increases from a D to a B, it is time to invest," writes Palacios. "When the index falls from a B to a D, it is time to divest. When the HCRI has reached a C or better and is improving, we recommend investing with more optimism, including investing for the long-term." We may not be headed for a housing crash.  But the return of housing optimism may be a sign we're topping. John Burns Real Estate Consulting
Henry Blodget / Business InsiderThe hottest new attraction in the United Kingdom these days is not a royal palace or some rocks in a field. It's the studio in Leavesden where Warner Bros. spent ten years making the Harry Potter movies. A converted factory that was once used to make planes in World War II, Leavesden is still a working studio. But a big portion of it has been transformed into a gigantic show-and-tell Harry Potter sound stage exhibit. About 5,000 people a day make the trek to Leavesden, which is a half-hour northwest of London. They pay about $30 apiece to get in. That means that Warner is coining ~$50 million a year from Harry Potter studio tours from ticket prices alone. (And you're not going to leave with just a ticket â€” believe me.) My family is way into Harry Potter, and we were in London last week. So, of course, we went. It was awesome.
One of the big economic stories that America is looking for forward to is the manufacturing renaissance. This is the idea that rising overseas labor costs and falling domestic energy costs will cause jobs and manufacturing capacity to return to the U.S. While we have yet to see significant evidence that this has actually begun, we at least know that the offshoring of jobs has decelerated and may have hit an inflection point. "The offshoring boom does appear to have largely run its course," writes Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth, pointing to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data on mass layoffs. "Offshoring layoffs have fallen sharply relative to both total layoffs and layoffs due to relocations elsewhere within the US," he writes. "This would seem to confirm that offshoring has lost a lot of its appeal over the past couple of years." Capital Economics
Flickr / dekstopAlternative currency Bitcoin has seen a spectacular rise lately. Â  The digital, decentralized currency that first emerged in 2009 is now trading above $141. It was trading around $35 in early march. Since there has been a great deal of chatter about the alternative currency, we were curious if any hedge funds were getting in on the action. Last month,Â Forbes' contributor Jon Matonis first reportedÂ that Malta-based prime brokerage firm Exante launched the first Bitcoin hedge fund calledÂ the Bitcoin Fund.Â We couldn't find any from the U.S., though. Part of being a hedge fund is having flexibility in what you invest in as long as it's disclosed in the operating documents. For instance, there are funds that buy houses, farmland and timber, so why not snap up a stake in Bitcoins?Â  We spoke to third party marketerÂ Don Steinbrugge, managing partner of Richmond, Virginia-based Agecroft Partners, and he told us that he's not currently aware of any hedge funds in participating Bitcoins, but that doesn't mean they couldn't play it. How To Play Bitcoin Steinbrugge thinks there are two ways hedge funds could play this new currency.  The first way is that the funds could trade the currency, which would be something a macro manager or Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) might do.Â  The second way hedge funds could participate would be in class shares. Â  "A lot of hedge funds have share classes of multiple currencies and, you know, there are issues with anyone's currency because long term you're kind of dependent on the federal reserve of that particular country. So I could definitely see long term people evolving share classes that they use. And if this new currency evolves and people view it as a better way to maintain value, I could see people evolving to use this too."Â  Hedge Funds Wouldn't Want A Big Stake The issue right now is that the currency is fairly small, Steinbrugge explained. There's currently only 11 million Bitcoins in existence giving it a market capitalization of just over $1.5 billion." That's very small for a currency so hedge funds could participate, but you couldn't allocate a lot to it. It would be a very small percent of a global macro or CTA portfolio," SteinbruggeÂ said. Steinbrugge explained that a hedge fund is not going to want to represent a large percent of the shares outstanding. Â They probably wouldn't want more than 5%, he added.Â  Since the market cap is about $1.5 billion that would make 5% equal to $75,000,000. So if it's a $10 billion hedge fund that would be 0.75% of the portfolio, which is a very, very small percentage. Â  Just Now Getting Attention Bitcoin, which has been around since 2009, has turned into a media freenzy lately, but that doesn't mean everyone is paying attention. Business Insider had a conversation with a global macro futures trader recently who didn't really know much about Bitcoins. In fact, he had only heard of it in passing. So if we had to guess, there are probably people in the fund space that haven't caught on quite yet.Â  The currency is definitely attracting more attention, though. Â So far this week, we have seen two Wall Street analysts put out notes (here and here).Â  And as it attracts more attention, it will be an interesting space to watch. Â Â  "I think there's a lot of concern about policies of central banks and the impact it will have on currencies in the long term. Â I think having an alternative currency long term will be very interesting to the hedge fund industry," Steinbrugge said. * If you are a hedge fund or know of a hedge fund who is investing in Bitcoins, please send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.com. We will be discreet.Â 
European Parliament / FlickrECB President Mario DraghiOMT: Outright Monetary Transactions. It's the ECB's plan to backstop troubled countries in the euro zone in need of financial assistance and prevent their borrowing costs (i.e., government bond yields) from reaching levels deemed unsustainably high. The mere announcement of OMT at the ECB's August 2012 meeting was enough to quell market turmoil and send bond yields across the euro periphery tumbling until this month, when Cyprus reintroduced contagion fears into European markets. Yet the OMT program still hasn't actually been activated yet, and still, no one knows how it's actually supposed to work.* According to Intesa Sanpaolo interest rate strategist Sergio Capaldi, who describes Slovenia as a "likely OMT target" in a note to clients, that may be about to change. Slovenia is the country the market appears to be viewing as the next likely candidate for a bailout from the euro zone. Government bond yields have surged there in the wake of the Cyprus deal, though they have started to back off a bit. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergClick to enlarge Capaldi provides an overview of the Slovenia situation and why he thinks they are a likely OMT target: Now that the Cypriot crisis is on the backburner, market focus has shifted to Slovenia and to possible contagion effects. Slovenia’s fiscal issues stem from the presence of contingent liabilities, i.e. debt non directly held by the government, but which may be considered as such given certain conditions. Bank debt is a classic example: governments are implicit guarantors of the stability of the entire system, therefore the markets tend to consider funding difficulties in the banking sector as akin to those faced by sovereign issuers. As a result, the banking system is the critical link. Slovenia’s new Prime Minster, Alenka Bratus<U+030C>ek, who has been in office for just over a week, has affirmed that Slovenia is not Cyprus, and that he doesn’t believe the country will need European financial assistance. Having taken stock of the umpteenth geography revision, and while acknowledging the obvious differences between the two countries in terms of the macroeconomic, financial, and fiscal profiles, a potential request for financial assistance (estimated at between one and three billion euros) to recapitalise the Slovenian banking system would involve the template used for Spain, and not for Cyprus. Unlike the latter country, the Slovenian banking system is smaller in size (significantly smaller than the European average) and a pressing concern will be to confirm that the bailout model used for Cyprus cannot represent a standard approach. What’s more, if an ESM primary market purchase facility is asked, the ECB could play a more active role and use the OMT programme in a market worth a total of 16 billion euros. Maturities in 2013 add up to around 1.50 billion euros, of which 1.42 billion in T-bills alone. Considering budget forecasts for 2013 (deficit of 5.1% according to the European Commission), net issues of 1.5 billion should be sufficient to cover the deficit. On the whole, gross funding should amount to around 3 billion euros (including T-bills), a sum which should be placed on the market with no particular hitches.  Yesterday, Slovenia's new central bank governor ruled out asking for international help. That, of course, could change if things get worse. Still, it's unclear whether Slovenia is actually eligible for OMT. Someone may put the question to ECB President Mario Draghi at Thursday's ECB press conference, though. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *At the March ECB press conference, Financial Times correspondent Michael Steen asked ECB President Mario Draghi: "Mr Draghi, you have just said that we know the rules on OMTs. I do not think I am alone in saying that, actually, I do not think we do. The only thing you have published that I am aware of is an approximately 440-word statement that you read out to us in September; other than that it feels a bit like we are slowly piecing together the picture. Would you consider giving us, at some point, a full, written, point-by-point document stating how it works, what a country must do, etc., or is this a deliberate policy to keep it a little bit vague?" Draghi replied: "I am not sure I understand your question. I think, by now, that you have in fact stopped asking questions about how the OMT works because you understand how it works. We have gone through all the conditions that would make a country eligible for OMTs and we have said that this would be a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the ECB to step in. We listed the conditions, we specified the role of the European Stability Mechanism, the International Monetary Fund, and so on and so forth. I do not want to go through all of this again and again. If you are referring to the legal documentation, that is a different matter. We are still working on this. It is coming out, but that is it in terms of information on how it works."
Here is a new update of a popular market valuation method using the most recent Standard &amp; Poor's "as reported" earnings and earnings estimates and the index monthly averages of daily closes for the past month, which is 1,550.83. The ratios in parentheses use the monthly close of 1,569.19. For the earnings, see the table below created from Standard &amp; Poor's latest earnings spreadsheet. <U+25CF> TTM P/E ratio = 17.5 (17.7) <U+25CF> P/E10 ratio = 22.5 (22.7) The Valuation Thesis  A standard way to investigate market valuation is to study the historic Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio using reported earnings for the trailing twelve months (TTM). Proponents of this approach ignore forward estimates because they are often based on wishful thinking, erroneous assumptions, and analyst bias. TTM P/E Ratio The "price" part of the P/E calculation is available in real time on TV and the Internet. The "earnings" part, however, is more difficult to find. The authoritative source is the Standard &amp; Poor's website, where the latest numbers are posted on the earnings page. (See the footnote below for instructions on accessing the file). The table here shows the TTM earnings based on "as reported" earnings and a combination of "as reported" earnings and Standard &amp; Poor's estimates for "as reported" earnings for the next few quarters. The values for the months between are linear interpolations from the quarterly numbers. The average P/E ratio since the 1870's has been about 15. But the disconnect between price and TTM earnings during much of 2009 was so extreme that the P/E ratio was in triple digits — as high as the 120s — in the Spring of 2009. In 1999, a few months before the top of the Tech Bubble, the conventional P/E ratio hit 34. It peaked close to 47 two years after the market topped out. As these examples illustrate, in times of critical importance, the conventional P/E ratio often lags the index to the point of being useless as a value indicator. "Why the lag?" you may wonder. "How can the P/E be at a record high after the price has fallen so far?" The explanation is simple. Earnings fell faster than price. In fact, the negative earnings of 2008 Q4 (-$23.25) is something that has never happened before in the history of the S&amp;P 500. Let's look at a chart to illustrate the unsuitability of the TTM P/E as a consistent indicator of market valuation.     The P/E10 Ratio Legendary economist and value investor Benjamin Graham noticed the same bizarre P/E behavior during the Roaring Twenties and subsequent market crash. Graham collaborated with David Dodd to devise a more accurate way to calculate the market's value, which they discussed in their 1934 classic book, Security Analysis. They attributed the illogical P/E ratios to temporary and sometimes extreme fluctuations in the business cycle. Their solution was to divide the price by a multi-year average of earnings and suggested 5, 7 or 10-years. In recent years, Yale professor Robert Shiller, the author of Irrational Exuberance, has reintroduced the concept to a wider audience of investors and has selected the 10-year average of "real" (inflation-adjusted) earnings as the denominator. Shiller refers to this ratio as the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio, abbreviated as CAPE, or the more precise P/E10, which is my preferred abbreviation. The Correlation between the S&amp;P Composite and its P/E10 As the chart below illustrates, the P/E10 closely tracks the real (inflation-adjusted) price of the S&amp;P Composite. In fact, the correlation between the two since 1881, the year when the first decade of average earnings is available, is 0.77. (Note: A perfect positive correlation would be 1 and the absence of correlation would be 0).     The historic P/E10 average is 16.5. After dropping to 13.3 in March 2009, the ratio rebounded to an interim high of 23.5 in February of 2011 year and is now at 22.5. The ratio in the chart above is doubly smoothed (10-year average of earnings and monthly averages of daily closing prices for the index). Thus the fluctuations during the month aren't especially relevant (e.g., the difference between the monthly average and monthly close P/E10). Of course, the historic P/E10 has never flat-lined on the average. On the contrary, over the long haul it swings dramatically between the over- and under-valued ranges. If we look at the major peaks and troughs in the P/E10, we see that the high during the Tech Bubble was the all-time high above 44 in December 1999. The 1929 high of 32.6 comes in at a distant second. The secular bottoms in 1921, 1932, 1942 and 1982 saw P/E10 ratios in the single digits. Where does the current valuation put us? For a more precise view of how today's P/E10 relates to the past, our chart includes horizontal bands to divide the monthly valuations into quintiles — five groups, each with 20% of the total. Ratios in the top 20% suggest a highly overvalued market, the bottom 20% a highly undervalued market. What can we learn from this analysis? The Financial Crisis of 2008 triggered an accelerated decline toward value territory, with the ratio dropping to the upper second quintile in March 2009. The price rebound since the 2009 low pushed the ratio back into the top quintile, and it has since hovered around that boundary. By this historic measure, the market is expensive, with the ratio approximately 36% above its average (arithmetic mean) of 16.5 (16.47 to two decimal places). Last month it was 34% above. I've also included a regression trendline through the P/E10 ratio for the edification of anyone who believes the price-earnings ratio has naturally tended higher over time as markets evolve. The latest ratio is about 20% above trend, up from 17% last month (19.6% versus 17.4% at one decimal place). Critics of this more optimistic view would point to the unprecedented P/Es of the Tech Bubble as the explanation for this "unnatural" slope to the regression. We can also use a percentile analysis to put today's market valuation in the historical context. As the chart below illustrates, latest P/E10 ratio is approximately at the 87th percentile of the 1587 data points in this series.     A more cautionary observation is that when the P/E10 has fallen from the top to the second quintile, it has eventually declined to the first quintile and bottomed in single digits. Based on the latest 10-year earnings average, to reach a P/E10 in the high single digits would require an S&amp;P 500 price decline below 550. Of course, a happier alternative would be for corporate earnings to continue their strong and prolonged surge. If the 2009 trough was not a P/E10 bottom, when might we see it occur? These secular declines have ranged in length from over 19 years to as few as three. The current decline is now approaching its 13th anniversary. Or was March 2009 the beginning of a secular bull market? Perhaps, and certainly the new nominal all-time high set at the end of March is a conspicuous tick mark for the optimists. But the history of market valuations suggests a cautious perspective.   Note: Follow these steps to access the Standard &amp; Poor's earnings spreadsheet: Note: For readers unfamiliar with the S&amp;P Composite index, see this article for some background information.
It's official. Goldman Sachs has inaugurated the second stage of Wall Street's development after Dodd-Frank and the Volcker Rule. The first post-reform stage was the transformation of proprietary trading units into market-making trading units. Before Volcker, Wall Street firms risked their own capital trading securities with counterparties. After Volcker, Wall Street firms risked their own capital trading securities in anticipation and reaction to customer order flow. The old way was to ask: "how can we make money by reacting to market events?" The new way is to ask: "how can we make money by reacting to customer reactions to market events?" See the difference? In the old way, you had counterparties. In the new way, you focus on customers. And those two words â€” counterparty and customer â€” are totally spelled differently despite beginning with the same letter. Officially, this was the "getting rid of things we aren't allowed to have anymore" stage: hedge funds, private equity funds, prop trading outfits. Goldman was a big leader in shedding the stuff they figured was taboo even before the final rules were written. And now we've entered the next stage, the "building new things that we think we can have" stage. In this stage, Wall Street firms will attempt to do things that are a lot like what they used to do â€” but in new ways, using new kinds of legal loopholes because the old ones were sewn shut with Volcker thread. Goldman is once again taking the lead in this business. Ordinary folks will think this means Wall Street is getting around the Volcker Rule. But that's why they are so ordinary. On Wall Street this is called "compliance." The new thing Goldman is going to start doing is running a credit fund for wealthy customers that will invest in the unrated debt of mid-sized companies. This will replace the old thing Goldman did to run a credit fund for wealthy customers that wanted to invest in risky debt. The old things at Goldman were called "hedge funds." The new thing is called a "business-development company." Actually, business-development companies â€” or BDC if you want to sound knowing â€” aren't really all that new. They've been around for decades. They just weren't all that attractive to investment banks that could run hedge funds, which were less regulated. Goldman's new business-development company will be called "Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC" â€” probably because the guy who came up with this idea has an office that looks out at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. It will sell shares to investors in a private placement. Liberty Harbor will then borrow money to enhance its ability to buy up loads of debt that has never been rated by a credit-rating agency. The managers of GS Liberty Harbor LLC â€” let's call it GoSaLiHa, pronounced "Go Sell It Ha!" â€” are a bunch of guys â€” and, maybe, some gals, but this is Wall Street so, you know, probably not â€” who went over to Goldman after their old hedge fund, Amaranth Advisors, imploded back in 2006. You will have to try not to confuse GoSaLiHa with a hedge fund run by these same people called Liberty Harbor, which is part of Goldman Sachs's asset-management group. Liberty Harbor manages about $5 billion in assets, according to a fund prospectus. That was one of the old things Goldman did. And although it's still doing this thing because the Volcker prohibitions are phased in over eternity, eventually Goldman's desire to run the fund without being able to own a major part of it will diminish. Ominously, when GoSaLiHa was first uncovered by Reuters' Matt Goldstein back in January, it was run by Greg Felton. He has since left Goldman. No one knows why. It will now be run by Raanan Agus, the co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, which is another hedge fund run by Goldman. But please remember: This isn't a hedge fund! Or a private equity company! There are many things a hedge fund or private-equity company could theoretically do that a BDC cannot do. The law limits the amount of debt a BDC can take on to an amount equal to its equity. BDCs cannot have single positions that are larger than 25 percent of their portfolio. Most importantly, they are also required to have most percent of their assets in privately issued securities of private companies not listed on any national exchange. But they can also do things that hedge funds could not. Like take in investors who aren't super wealthy. Investors do not need to meet the income, net worth, or sophistication criteria imposed on private-equity investment. So these things can be sold to ordinary investors â€” although that certainly is not Goldman's plan. It has too many extraordinary investors to even think about selling to ordinary folk. Bonus regulatory compliance: Goldman said in its public filings that this BDC will also count as an "emerging-growth company" under Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. This means it can take advantage of reduced reporting rules meant to encourage tech start-ups to go public. So none of those pesky Sarbanes-Oxley audited internal controls requirements. And if Goldman were to IPO this thing, the bank doing the underwriting could produce research reports touting it. What does it mean to have a credit fund that counts as a start-up for disclosure and a business development company run by Wall Street's premier investment bank? No one really knows. As far as I can tell, no one ever contemplated what would happen if someone put hedge-fund managers specializing in risky credit in charge of a BDC that is also a JOBS Act emerging-growth company. Or, at least, no one who wasn't at Goldman Sachs ever did. But what could go wrong?
Wall Street plaintiffs' firm Faruqi &amp; Faruqi has filed a defamation lawsuit against a former Faruqi lawyer who says a partner harassed her and forced her to have sex. Faruqi's $15 million countersuit says Alexandra Marchuk made up lurid lies about the firm and a prominent partner to ruin its reputation and get some cash. Indeed, Marchuk's allegations in the sexual harassment suit she filed against Faruqi are horrifying. She says Juan Monteverde harassed her relentlessly and, on the night of an office holiday party, pushed her to the floor and "quickly, forcefully, and painfully had sex with her." The countersuit portrays Marchuk, a 2011 Vanderbilt Law grad, as "obsessive" and adoring, and it says she repeatedly hit on Monteverde. It was Marchuk who asked Monteverde to go back to his office on the night he allegedly forced himself on her, the suit says. Faruqi &amp; Faruqi's suit goes on to allege that Marchuk had "not worn a bra and panties" the night Monteverde allegedly forced her to have sex. Monteverde, who was drunk, couldn't get an erection, so Marchuk performed oral sex on him, according to the lawsuit. "Monteverde did not resist," the suit says. Harry Lipman, a lawyer for Marchuk, told BI that Faruqi &amp; Faruqi's countersuit is "frivolous" and contains allegations that are a "tellingly desperate attempt to blame the victim." Faruqi &amp; Faruqi acknowledges in a press release posted by Above the Law that Monteverde "exercised very poor judgment," but says it's convinced he didn't sexually harass Marchuk. Monteverde is apparently a pretty big money maker for Faruqi &amp; Faruqi. He has led the firm's lucrative pursuit of "say on pay" litigation against huge corporations authorized under Obama's financial regulatory reforms enacted in 2010.
Wikimedia CommonsThe price of Bitcoin, the bizarre digital currency, has been skyrocketing.Â  And everyone's calling it a bubble. But it's not like most other bubbles. Art Cashin, UBS' man on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, contrasts the Bitcoin bubble to the Dutch tulip mania of the 17th century.Â  Here's Cashin: Trading Tulips In Real Time â€“ It is rare that we get to see a bubble-like phenomenon trade tick for tick in real time.Â  Usually it's kind of regional aggregate pricing like real estate reports.Â  But, all that may be changing â€“ before our very eyes â€“ quite literally.Â  The bubble du jour may be something called a "bitcoin." Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal made this same point earlier today. "You can go here and watch Bitcoin trade tick-by-tick, which is not something you could ever do with these other unconventional micro-bubbles." Everyone's trying to figure out what's going on with Bitcoin. Without explicitly arguing for causation, Cashin points to a correlation. The bidding for Bitcoins has turned a bit more aggressive since the Cyprus "bailin" and the seizure of a portion of bank deposits.Â  The Bitcoin recently traded at an amazing $100 (it had been $50 just two weeks ago). We have yet to see Bitcoin make a major down move. "Last night trading turned a bit whacky and the Bitcoin spiked above 145 before plunging in a few trades back to $126," wrote Cashin.Â  "Just what the world needs â€“ a "safe" currency."
missmeng via FlickrThe ISM services release is out. The headline ISM non-manufacturing index fell to 54.4 in March from 56.0 in February. Economists expected a smaller drop to 55.5. Any number above 50 indicates expansion, so this reading indicates that the pace of expansion in the American services sector slowed in March, but remains robust. The index was led lower by the prices sub-component, which tumbled 5.8 points to 55.9 from 61.7 last month. The employment sub-component fell 3.9 points to 53.3 from 57.2 last month, and the new orders sub-component decreased 3.6 points to 54.6 from 58.2 last month.

Wikipedia CommonsNow that Yale acceptance letters have been sent out, Bulldogs-in-waiting can start planning their college experience. And in the grand tradition of that venerable institution, some freshmen may want to consider joining a secret society. The thing is — they're not that secret. Last summer The Yale Herald conducted a survey of over 1,000 students that showed that a whopping 50.6% of seniors were in secret societies, while 63% of juniors were under consideration to join one. That isn't to say these clubs aren't attractive anymore. Over 73% of underclassmen surveyed said that they wanted to join one. Lucky for them, some upperclassmen were kind enough to share the questions they were asked while they were pledging. Now we're passing those along to you.

via Sotheby's International RealtyWe learned that the penthouse of New York City's Pierre Hotel was hitting the market for a record $125 million last week, and the official listing has finally surfaced with some photos of the space. The apartment, which belonged to late investor Martin Zweig, encompasses three floors and was originally the hotel's ballroom. Commenters over on Curbed NY have pointed out that the apartment's history as a massive ballroom means its an awkward living space today; that doesn't mean it's not pretty to look at. The 16-room spread is listed with Sotheby's International Realty.
They're Bitcoins!The value of the electronic currency Bitcoin has gone bananas in the last five weeks, blasting from about $35 a coin in early March to a new high of $145 last night. Bitcoin has now blown through my previous price target. So it is time to raise that target again. So I'm raising my Bitcoin price target to $400. Just kidding. I don't have a Bitcoin price target. And the idea of raising a Bitcoin target to "$400," I should explain, is sort of an inside joke: Fifteen years ago, when I was a stock analyst during the Internet boom, I put a $400 target on the stock of Amazon.com. Amazon was a highly controversial stock at the time — many people thought the company was "just a bookstore" and would "never make money" — and the stock had already reached what some people viewed as an insane level. I didn't think that predicting that Amazon could go to $400 was particularly radical — that was one of many possible scenarios supported by the numbers. But my target "plucked the chords of the zeitgeist," as the writer Jay McInerney once said about a book of his, and suddenly everyone had something to say about it. (Fortunately for me, Amazon soon blasted to $400 and beyond. And after a seven-year fallow period, it has continued to do well. On a split-adjusted basis, my "$400" target is about $67 in today's Amazon stock). But! If I were going to put a price target on Bitcoin, I would think that $400 would be a perfectly reasonable target. Unfortunately, so would $1,000. Or $2,000. Or $5,000. And, because you're probably already getting ready to blast me for "irresponsibly fueling speculation," so would $0. That's right: $0. Nada. Nothing. Me, in the Amazon $400 days.If the government comes in and declares Bitcoin illegal, or if someone figures out how to hack or counterfeit Bitcoin, or if Bitcoin speculators suddenly wake up one morning and collectively panic, Bitcoin prices will plummet. And there will no "fundamentals" for the value of Bitcoins to fall back on. That's something to keep in mind as you watch the Bitcoin frenzy build. A couple of days ago, I called Bitcoin the "perfect bubble." What I meant is that Bitcoin has all the elements required to become a massive speculative bubble ... along with the additional attribute of not being constrained by any "fundamental" value whatsoever. Specifically, Bitcoin has: So Bitcoin has everything it needs to become a major speculative bubble. But the difference between Bitcoin and, say, the 1990s Internet bubble, is that there really is no fundamental way to value Bitcoin. In theory, the fundamental value of a stock is "the present value of future cash flows" that the company will produce. The $400 target I put on Amazon in 1998, for example, was based in part on long-term revenue and profit projections for the company. But Bitcoin does not generate any cash flows. Business InsiderThe only "cash" that Bitcoin will generate in the future is cash that comes from someone who buys it from you (or accepts it as payment for something). So the "fundamental" value of Bitcoin can only be estimated the same way the fundamental value of, say, gold can be estimated — which is guessing at what someone will be willing to pay for it at some time in the future. That attribute creates more risk for Bitcoin speculators. But it also creates more potential upside. Because there is nothing to constrain the price of Bitcoins other than what other people are willing to pay for it. Another thing to keep in mind about asset bubbles is that the big ones take years to develop and hit their peaks. The dotcom stocks, for example, were dismissed as a "bubble" way back in 1995 ... a full five years before the peak. The housing market was called a bubble in 2003 and 2004, many years before prices peaked. And in the intervening years, the folks who accepted the risks and played the game made money hand over fist. It's also important to note that both dotcoms and houses have created massive sustainable value despite going through a "bubble" era. Yes, prices fell. But the value of the Internet sector is now vastly higher than it was at the peak of the dotcom bubble. And some day the same will be true for houses. Today, the excitement around Bitcoin is still confined to a tiny segment of the population — technology aficionados, monetary idealists, drug dealers, and, increasingly, speculators. This means that if Bitcoin prices continue to rise, there are hundreds of millions of new "players" who might enter the market and increase the demand for Bitcoins. This new demand could radically increase the demand (and price) for what will ultimately be a finite supply of Bitcoin. This increase in demand, if it occurs, will almost certainly not be steady. Instead, Bitcoin demand will increase in fits and starts ... with booms like the one we've seen over the past month followed by busts in which prices crash and everyone who did not buy in feels smug and smart. And then the process will repeat again, with a much higher high, followed by another interim bust. And so on. That's the way the great bubbles build. And Bitcoin could certainly become a great bubble. Of course, given the ongoing risk of hacking, counterfeiting, new supply, and government intervention, along with the technological challenges (it's really hard to figure out how to use Bitcoin), the interim crashes could be sharp and scary. And they could also be permanent. But, for now, the Bitcoin boom still appears to be in its early stages. So if I were still in the price target business, maybe I would raise my Bitcoin price target to $400. Or $1,000. Or $5,000. Because there's no reason why Bitcoins couldn't eventually be worth that much. And it's worth noting one last thing: The odds Bitcoin speculators are looking at are similar to the odds early Internet speculators were looking at: The most you can lose is 100% of your bet. The most you can make, meanwhile, is theoretically unlimited. And in some circles, assuming only a limited amount of capital is wagered, those odds are what might be described as a "good bet." So let the speculation continue!
Flickr/greenflames09For months now, the question has been when the stock market rally that began in November would finally face a downward correction. Now, everyone is starting to talk about market "internals" breaking down â€“ various technical factors that are warning of a pullback. In a note this morning, Miller Tabak Chief Technical Market Analyst Jonathan Krinsky says "the cracks in the market appear to be growing, with the small-caps and transports severely underperforming." Doug Kass says the same thing today, pointing to "subsurface weakness" in the market. Here are a few points Kass highlights in his note: TheÂ Russell 2000Â underperformed on Monday (-1.3%) and was down (-0.5%) on an up day on Tuesday. The advance/decline line is eroding as the market's rise narrows. Breadth disappointed â€“ yesterday,Â NYSEÂ decliners eclipsed advancing issues by over 200, excluding ETFs and fixed-income closed-end funds. The number of new 52-week highs isÂ narrowing. The bank stocks/brokerages are lagging. Transports trailed, down 1.5% and 1.2% on the first two days of the week, respectively --Â check outÂ the chart ofÂ FedExÂ (FDX). Semis got schmeissed (-2.0% on Monday and -0.8% on Tuesday). The cyclical index dropped by -0.7% on Tuesday, following a 1.2% decline on Monday --Â check outÂ the chart ofÂ CaterpillarÂ (CAT). The yield on the 10-year U.S. note remains low (1.86%) and is signaling slowing domestic economic growth -- speaking of the bond market, this week brought a continued disconnect between Treasury note and bond yields (lower by 3 to 4 basis points) compared to the market averages (slightly higher in price). "It is an unusual market feature when defensive stocks are among the leading groups in a market moving to new highs," says Kass. On the other hand, Phoenix Partners Group Chief Equities Strategist Michael Block doesn't think these signals are necessarily anything to worry about. "As for the argument that defensives have led, my advice is to think about what quant factors might be leading those stocks higher here," says Block. "There are style, size, and fundamental factors there that are likely the cause... and it has nothing to do with them being hiding places." Block points out that Russell 2000 outperformance is still trending up despite recent weakness, and that he considers these technical factors "an early warning sign and nothing to jump in against with both feet."

Flickr / sylvarBitcoins are getting more and more attention in mainstream financial circles. Sebastien Galy, a currency analyst at SocGen has put out a note to clients on the nature of Bitcoins and how one might go about valuing them. The analysis is pretty rough, but for the financially minded this is a good introduction to thinking about the economics of the currency. The middle part offers to ways one might go about thinking about valuing Bitcoins. Galy has kindly let us run his whole note, which is below the dotted line. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This proved an interesting subject from a central bank/regulatory point of view. Please find below a more comprehensive view on bitcoins. I thank the many who gave me some info, in particular Steve, my super-quant (ex)colleague from MIT. Bitcoins have a money supply that is theoretically increasing, following an algorithm approximating the effort of mining. As more hashing/solving power from miners appears on the network, the difficulty of solving the next problem increases. Right now the BTC/USD is tightly following the mining cost of BTC. It tracks how many people are getting involved into it (the more people mining it, the higher cost to get it because of fixed weekly supply). Some smart investors started to realize that under this situation, you really should buy and hold rather than mining it (obviously). As more buyers come in=&gt;higher prices=&gt;more miners=&gt;more buyers creating a positive feedback loop, whose nature is quite questionable. I was told thatHowever, with confidence in this BTC potentially increasing, the market actually starts building up its intrinsic value as a means of exchange, which might eventually make it potentially more stable in the long-term. Some professional investors believe the BTC thing is going to rise, though through a very bumpy road in the next few months. How can we value bitcoins intrinsic value? -- Monetary Approach. One way to value bitcoins would be to compare the money supply of the US vs bitcoins (1bn USD or so). That simplistic approach would make bitcoins very valuable if they end up being able to buy the same USD asset. This is a supply approach and easily solvable. -- Law of one price approach. On the demand side, a dollar is used to purchase, say, a piece of software, or game tokens within a game, or to pay someone for watching a video. There the reality meets the rubber. As far as I can see within a game, the value [of] the bitcoin is devalued as games introduce their own tokens (e.g. Metal storm has now three different levels of tokens depending on whether it is externally tradable, internally). If the bitcoin becomes too expensive it loses its usefulness as a numeraire used for exchange. Structure of the currency: -- Monetary Policy. With far more rapid advances in the technology of processing than mining, the rules have already been changed to stop some forms of mining which were too effective. This was effectively a form of revaluation of the currency. -- Legal framework. From a technical point of view, the bitcoin is not yet a currency in the sense that the currency is not anonymous. Volume is low and hence it is easy to influence the price. There is no certainty that the supply of bitcoins will follow the original rules, these rules have already been changed and presume a trust in the ones able to issue the currency. In many countries, printing money is a state privilege that will come to bite in the future as this, like gambling, is regulated for good reasons. In the U.S., the government introduced rules to cover electronic moneys. -- Technicals. From a trading point of view, we broke out of the upward-trending channel in an exponential upswing typical of aggressive bubbles. As [with] all bubbles, there is a good story behind it, the trick would be to measure both the supply side and more importantly demand side value of bitcoins.

APThe Obama administration is readying a push to get banks to make more home loans available to individuals with weaker credit, The Washington Post's Zach Goldfarb reports. It's a push that walks a tightrope, since it is expected to help boost the continuing economic recovery immediately but risks opening up the shaky lending that led to the housing crash. Obama's plan would provide for more lending to individuals such as young people buying their first homes, as well as people whose credit has been damaged by the recession. More details from Goldfarb: [A]dministration officials say they are working to get banks to lend to a wider range of borrowers by taking advantage of taxpayer-backed programs â€” including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration â€” that insure home loans against default. Housing officials are urging the Justice Department to provide assurances to banks, which have become increasingly cautious, that they will not face legal or financial recriminations if they make loans to riskier borrowers who meet government standards but later default. Officials are also encouraging lenders to use more subjective judgment in determining whether to offer a loan and areÂ seeking to make it easier for people who owe more than their properties are worth to refinance at todayâ€™s low interest rates, among other steps. Obama hinted at a push during his State of the Union address in January. "Even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected," Obama said. "Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. Thatâ€™s holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it."
REUTERS/Robert Galbraith The number is out and it's not so hot. Analysts expected 200K but instead it came in at just 158K. On the other hand, last week's ADP was revised from 198K to 237K. So the number was not pretty, but it's ADP and folks aren't likely to put a ton of weight. Here's an interesting chart by industry. Of note is that there were ostensibly zero new construction jobs. ADP Â  ---------- This Friday we get the Non-Farm Payrolls report. As a preview today we get the ADP jobs report for March, which just measures private sector job creation. Analysts expect to see 200K new jobs. We'll have the full number here at 8:15 AM ET.
REUTERS/KCNALately, we've heard a lot of blustery rhetoric out of North Korea. The problem is that we're so used to hearing a lot of blustery rhetoric from North Korea that it's usually hard to take seriously, and it's usually brushed off by the international community as more of the same. Today, North Korea blocked South Korean workers from entering the shared industrial complex in the town of Kaesong, which lies on the border between the two countries. It's the only inter-Korean economic project left in existence, and North Korea hasn't moved to block entry like that since 2009. Apparently, the latest developments in the Korean conflict are still not enough for international markets to worry about. However, they do appear to be taking a toll on South Korean markets, according to Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. In a note this morning, Reid writes: Turning to Asia, the escalating tensions between North and South Korea continue to dominate market headlines overnight. The Korean won dropped to a six-month low against the Greenback after the latest news that South Korean workers were refused access to an industrial park (Gaeseong zone) jointly run between the two countries for the first time since 2009. Demand for South Korean assets has taken a backseat ever since North Koreaâ€™s â€˜state of declarationâ€™ over the weekend and its decision to restart the Yongbyon nuclear site, which was shut down by the February 2007 disarmament accord. Koreaâ€™s 5-year sovereign CDS has come off its recent wides but still about 5bp wider on the week. If markets there are starting to take notice, it could be a sign that investors should at least keep one eye on this situation going forward.
AP / Charles KrupaGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
GlassdoorOn Tuesday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Apple by removing the stock from its exclusive "Americas Conviction Buy List." And this is causing tons of  confusion about how Goldman really feels about the iPhone maker. Here's the key excerpt from their note: Despite our optimism on this front, we believe the stock’s outperformance over the next 12 months will be more closely tied to whether or not the company’s next product cycles can reinvigorate market share momentum and installed base growth. We are optimistic in this respect, but there is still considerable uncertainty around the timing and impact of these product refreshes (we discuss our views on this in the body of the note). Until this uncertainty is resolved, the stock’s upside potential should be more limited than we previously anticipated. Bill Shope, Goldman's Apple analyst, slashed his price target to $575 from $660. So, that sounds pretty bearish. Here's where it gets confusing. Apple closed at $429 on Tuesday, which means Shope sees a massive 34 percent upside opportunity in the stock. Tuesday afternoon, Goldman's equity strategy team published its Monthly Chartbook, which included a list of stocks with the biggest upside opportunity (see below). To be clear, this list was based on March 28 prices and targets, which means it was before Goldman slashed its price target to $575. Still, with a 34 percent upside, Apple is still one of the 10 cheapest stocks in the entire market. So, "the stock’s upside potential should be more limited," yet it has one of the biggest upside opportunities in the whole market. Huh? Goldman Sachs
In his latest monthly commentary, PIMCO chief Bill Gross gets philosophical. His note is titled Man In The Mirror, and in something we've never seen before, there's a dramatic graphic up top. PIMCO So what is this all about? Basically, Gross is pondering the fact that various legends like himself, Warren Buffett, George Soros, Dan Fuss, and Peter Lynch may have just been products of an incredible period in financial history history over the last few decades. And one day that period may come to an end. And there will be no way to know who was truly great until the "epoch" changes, and one of great investors perfectly makes the change. Here are a few key paragraphs: Am I a great investor? No, not yet. To paraphrase Ernest Hemingwayâ€™s â€œJakeâ€ in The Sun Also Rises, â€œwouldnâ€™t it be pretty to think so?â€ But the thinking so and the reality are often miles apart. When looking in the mirror, the average human sees a six-plus or a seven reflection on a scale of one to ten. The big nose or weak chin is masked by brighter eyes or near picture-perfect teeth. And when the public is consulted, the vocal compliments as opposed to the near silent/ whispered critiques are taken as a supermajority vote for good looks. So it is with investing, or any career that is exposed to the public eye. The brickbats come via the blogs and ambitious competitors, but the roses dominate oneâ€™s mental and even physical scrapbook. In addition to hope, it is how we survive day-to-day. We look at the man or woman in the mirror and see an image that is as distorted from reality as the one in a circus fun zone. ... But let me admit something. There is not a Bond King or a Stock King or an Investor Sovereign alive that can claim title to a throne. All of us, even the old guys like Buffett, Soros, Fuss, yeah â€“ me too, have cut our teeth during perhaps a most advantageous period of time, the most attractive epoch, that an investor could experience. Since the early 1970s when the dollar was released from gold and credit began its incredible, liquefying, total return journey to the present day, an investor that took marginal risk, levered it wisely and was conveniently sheltered from periodic bouts of deleveraging or asset withdrawals could, and in some cases, was rewarded with the crown of â€œgreatness.â€ Perhaps, however, it was the epoch that made the man as opposed to the man that made the epoch. ... My point is this: PIMCOâ€™s epoch, Berkshire Hathawayâ€™s epoch, Peter Lynchâ€™s epoch, all occurred or have occurred within an epoch of credit expansion â€“ a period where those that reached for carry, that sold volatility, that tilted towards yield and more credit risk, or that were sheltered either structurally or reputationally from withdrawals and delevering (Buffett) that clipped competitors at just the wrong time â€“ succeeded. Yet all of these epochs were perhaps just that â€“ epochs. What if an epoch changes? What if perpetual credit expansion and its fertilization of asset prices and returns are substantially altered? What if zero-bound interest rates define the end of a total return epoch that began in the 1970s, accelerated in 1981, and has come to a mathematical dead-end for bonds in 2012/2013 and commonsensically for other conjoined asset classes as well? What if a future epoch favors lower than index carry or continual bouts of 2008 Lehmanesque volatility, or encompasses a period of global geopolitical confrontation with a quest for scarce and scarcer resources such as oil, water, or simply food as suggested by Jeremy Grantham? What if the effects of global â€œclimate change or perhaps aging demographics,â€ substantially alter the rather fertile petri dish of capitalistic expansion and endorsement? What if quantitative easing policies eventually collapse instead of elevate asset prices? What if there is a future that demands that an investor â€“ a seemingly great investor â€“ change course, or at least learn new tricks? Ah, now, that would be a test of greatness: the ability to adapt to a new epoch. The problem with the Buffetts, the Fusses, the Granthams, the Marks, the Dalios, the Gabellis, the Coopermans, and the Grosses of the world is that theyâ€™ll likely never find out. Epochs can and likely will outlast them. But then one never knows what time has in store for each of us, or what any of us will do in the spans of time. Read the full commentary here &gt;
Bitcoin has been on a parabolic surge. And people are telling all kinds of stories to justify the sharp move in the digital currency. They're claiming that it's a response to central bank intervention. And Cyprus. And all that kind of stuff. But if all that were true, wouldn't we see a rise in gold, which tends to do well on those impulses? Anyway, here's a chart of gold, which continues to be weak and boring. Kitco In his 'Bedtime With BTIG' note last night, Dan Greenhaus had this to say about gold: What hasnâ€™t worked during that timeframe has been the perceived safety of Gold and Silver; the GLD is down by 12.2% since October while the generic silver contract is down by nearly 23% over the same time frame. As we have advocated long gold positions in the past and remain long gold now, we can only paraphrase Dennis Gartman by saying â€œwhen something cant rally on perceivably bullish news, it aint in a bull market.â€ Weâ€™ll have more to say on this front another time but simply, we have not been fast enough in reacting to the decline in European CDS since June, an important indicator of gold prices.
In my book, the Missing Risk Premium, I argue the fundamental status orientation is why there is no risk premium in general, and why the perverse demand for low volatility assets is not arbitraged away (benchmark risk prevents this). Â This explanation is not even acknowledged by most (all?) academics for explaining things like the low volatility anomaly. Economists assume the main motivator is what can best be defined as greed, while I'm arguing envy is more important. I don't think it should be this way, that's a normative issue, I'm just saying that's how people behave. Indeed, I agree that an economist's conception of self-interest would be a major improvement: short-sighted selfishness is worse than long-sighted selfishness, but it's not nearly as destructive as envy. Alas, economists have the standard bias of thinking that everyone thinks as they do. Further, they have the bias that since it would be nicer to think people are not so much envious as rationally self-interested, it has to be true.  Humans have been genetically the same for about 50k years, and only in the past 350 years have we really changed life for your average person. The American Plains Indians had no conception of property rights when Columbus got here, and it highlights an earlier stage of society, more like our chimp cousins and the instincts they bequeathed us. It's nice to think that hunter-gatherer's are more peace-loving, and more in tune with the environment, more authentic, etc., when actually they are homicidal, dogmatic, and status obsessed; their lack of greed isn't a feature, it's a bug. It's good to appeal to higher aspirations, like telling your children they should aspire, not to be great men, but good men, because great men are often insufficiently empathetic. Yet, we shouldn't presume people are more greedy than envious, which is easy to do because most articulate chimps hide their envy behind altruism, as attacks on the 1% are presumably about wanting less injustice via equity. This is true for some, but I suspect it's not true for the vast majority, who simply want to knock those on top down closer to their level.
Flickr/eggplantThere's a growing meme that the momentum of the US economy is starting to fade a little bit. Nobody is too worried, but after a Q1 where growth may have been over 3%, the expectations for Q2 are significantly lower. So the data is getting really important to watch again. There are two important datapoints coming up today. Via Calculated Risk: â€¢ At 8:15 AM, The ADP Employment Report for March. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 205,000 payroll jobs added in March. â€¢ At 10:00 AM, ISM non-Manufacturing Index for March. The consensus is for a reading of 56.0 unchanged from 56.0 in February. Note: Above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction. ADP, of course, will be very closely watched as this is a preview for Friday's Non-Farm Payrolls report.
It's hard for any rational human to look at this chart and not conclude that Bitcoin is on an utterly parabolic rise, fueled by greed, speculation, and fascination, while being completely divorced from any "fundamentals." bitcoincharts.com We have no idea when the music will stop (it could go to $500 or $1000!) but at some point there will be a moment when it ends in tears, and people will wonder why they paid 40% more for something than it was selling at the day before. Here's what's really fascinating and unique about the Bitcoin boom. This isn't the first time we've seen a bubble in something in a privately created thing that's off the traditional financial markets. For example, in the early 2000s, there was a legitimate bubble in the stuffed animals called Beanie Babies. It's not clear why suddenly people started paying through the nose through them, and why whole industries were created around them, but it happened, and then they died. In the 90s there was something of a baseball card bubble. Bitcoin is somewhere in the middle: A privately created financial instrument. But what sets Bitcoin apart is the real-time data on it. You can go here and watch Bitcoin trade tick-by-tick, which is not something you could ever do with these other unconventional micro-bubbles. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin advocates (like all bubble apologists) have great stories (this is a response to Cyprus and wild central banks!), but in reality that's just an excuse. This is a fascination that people have, and the market is incredibly tiny, so it doesn't take too many new people wanting to dabble to make the price go nuts. That's all. And it's enjoyable watching it in real time.
While you were sleeping, the utterly insane roller coaster world of Bitcoin continued to do its thing. Just a few days ago we were marveling how the price of a Bitcoin had surpassed one $100. But then, via ClarkMoody.com, we woke up to see that Bitcoin had surged to $145 overnight. Clarkmoody.com But that wasn't the end of the story. Just in the early hours of Wednesday, the sellers appeared, and Bitcoin tanked to $126. Clarkmoody.com When you see moves like this, you know you're in a market fueled entirely by fear, greed, fascination and speculation, as moves become totally divorced from some underlying reality. Today should be a wild one.
Europe is a bit lower on the day. France is down 0.5%. Germany is down 0.2%. Italy, which continues to see political uncertainty, is down 0.8%. The big story of the day is Japan, where stocks rallied 3%! Nikkei.com On Thursday, Japan has its first Bank of Japan meeting under its new chief, and everyone's expecting some kind of aggressive new easing measure. Although this has been expected for awhile. Meanwhile, US futures are up a tad. In the US today, we get the ADP jobs report, a preview of this Friday's big Non-Farm Payrolls report.
