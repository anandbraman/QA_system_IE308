In its annual report on the world's least developed countries, or LDCs, the UN Conference on Trade and Development said that booming economic growth in the 48 nations on its list was having only minor impacts on living standards and the fight against widespread poverty. "The LDC paradox arises from the failure of LDC economies to achieve structural changes despite having grown vigorously as a result of strong export prices and rising aid flows", UNCTAD said. The 48 countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, had jointly seen their economies grow 5.6 percent in 2013 -- far above the 1.2-percent growth seen in developed countries. Yet nearly half of the population in LDCs continue to live in extreme poverty, almost 30 percent of people are undernourished and few are in secure employment, the UNCTAD report said. Nearly one third of people in these countries have no access to a clean water source and almost two thirds have no access to sanitation facilities, it said, also pointing out that one in 12 children there die before they turn five. One problem, the report said, was that many LDCs, especially the ones in Africa, are not investing enough in areas that generate secure employment, like manufacturing, technology and modernising the agriculture sector. In fact, the value produced annually by the average worker in the LDCs corresponds to just two percent of the value generated by their equivalent in developed countries, the report found. All LDCs are not equal though. Asian LDCs like Bangladesh and Cambodia, whose economies are dominated by manufacturing, had seen labour productivity swell 3.2 percent annually since the early 1990s, the report found. That is double the pace of African LDCs, whose economies are more dominated by oil, gas and metal mining, it said. Of the 48 countries on the LDC list, only one, Laos, appeared to be on track to achieve all seven Millenium Development Goals, which among other things called for halving poverty and extreme hunger by 2015. On average, the LDCs had reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 65 percent of their populations in 1990 to 45 percent in 2010. Asian LDCs did a better job, cutting the rate from 64 to 34 percent over the 20-year-period, compared to African LDCs and Haiti, which only saw a drop from 65 to 51 percent. While it is positive that some progress is being made, UNCTAD warned the slow advances seen so far in most LDC countries made the achievement of the likely and far more ambitious post-2015 goal of eradicating poverty by 2030 difficult to envision.   FREE AppDownload
Getty Images The Australian market dropped more than 1% on opening today. Energy stocks are getting smashed after OPEC oil producers decided against cutting production, which is expected to keep prices low. Crude oil broke through $US70 in trade overnight, for the first time since 2010. Ric Spooner, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets, says investors are pricing in the possibility of sustained weakness in the oil price and a scenario in which excess supply capacity might persist for the next year or two. “While today’s large drop in both oil prices and energy stocks might turn out to have been amplified by Thanksgiving holiday in the US and thin volumes, it does seem likely that OPEC’s decision creates the potential for a lower range of oil prices for some time to come,” he says. He says today’s OPEC decision means that new oil projects will be difficult to justify and finance for some time. There is also likely to be a decline in exploration activity. Santos has lost almost 10% to be trading at $10.50, Sundance Energy more than 15% to $0.695, Oil Search more than 8% to $7.77, Origin Energy 5% to $12.51, Woodside Petroleum more than 3% to $37.20 and Horizon Oil weaker by more than 6% to $0.21. A falling oil price has an upside in cheaper fuel, a major cost for airline Qantas whose shares jumped 3% to $1.85. Qantas is up 6% this week. The major banks were all weaker, led by Westpac which lost 0.87% to $32.94. Investing.com This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said in an interview with an Austrian newspaper that oil prices could fall below $60 by mid-way through next year. Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, also said U.S. oil production would fall after 2025 and that an oil market council should be created to monitor prices, the same day the OPEC cartel met in Vienna and left its output targets unchanged. "We expect that a fall in the price to $60 and below is possible, but only during the first half, or rather by the end of the first half (of next year)," Sechin told the Die Presse newspaper. On Thursday, OPEC decided against production cuts to halt a slide in global oil prices, sending benchmark Brent crude plunging to a fresh four-year low below $73 a barrel. Russia is not a member of OPEC. Sechin, who met representatives from world oil powers in Vienna earlier in the week, said he believed Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of production if prices remained low. On U.S. oil production, Sechin said: "After 2025, the production volumes will decrease, namely because of the resource base, to the extent that we know it today." Earlier on Thursday, Rosneft said in a statement that OPEC's decision to leave its output unchanged would not affect the work of the company.

Thomson ReutersTransportation app Uber driver Shuki Zanna waits for rides in his limousine in Beverly Hills(Reuters) - Ridesharing company Uber suspended its operations in the U.S. state of Nevada late on Wednesday in a setback that it said would cost nearly 1,000 jobs. Companies such as Uber allow passengers to summon cars using apps on their smartphones, rather than calling a taxi company, and have gained popularity in dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years. But they face opposition from taxi companies and some officials who argue the upstarts do not face the same stringent regulations as do traditional cabs, and insurance companies want their drivers to carry more expensive insurance policies. Uber's decision to temporarily suspend its service in Nevada came after a legal setback. On Tuesday, a Washoe County District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the company from statewide operations, siding with Nevada over regulatory concerns in a case that was referred to the court by a split panel of the state's Supreme Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. "It's unfortunate that Nevada is the first state in the nation to temporarily suspend Uber," spokeswoman Eva Behrend said in a statement, adding the shut-down would cost nearly 1,000 jobs. "We remain committed to working with Nevada's leaders to create a permanent regulatory framework that affords Nevadans the flexibility and innovation offered by Uber," Behrend said. Requests for comment were not immediately returned by Nevada's Attorney General's office. (Editing by Pravin Char) FREE AppDownload
Flickr / tiffany stevensonBERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Subdued food price inflation in Europe is unlikely to pick up any time soon, adding to the pressure on mainstream grocers as they struggle with changing shopping habits and competition from discounters. Prices paid in Europe for fast-moving consumer goods rose at their slowest pace since 2010 in the third quarter, and fell in Spain, France and Italy, according to consumer data firm Nielsen, weighing on retailers' revenues and share prices. The cost of fresh fruit and vegetables in particular has tumbled due to bumper harvests, a surplus caused by Russia's ban on food imports from the West, currency effects and fierce competition among grocers, stoked by the advance of discounters. Falling inflation has laid bare problems supermarkets were already facing as shopping habits shift. After decades investing in large out-of-town sites, grocers are struggling to adapt to more fickle consumers, who like to hunt for a bargain while also demanding more convenience stores and online shopping. "For a few years, those underlying challenges ... were partially masked by inflation which meant (grocers) still had absolute top line growth," said Will Hayllar of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants. "As that inflation has stabilized, the true picture of what's going on beneath has become more apparent." There is little sign of imminent relief, especially as oil prices -- a key input cost for farmers -- have dropped by a third since June, although potentially easier monetary policies and a weaker euro and sterling could help rekindle inflation. "Harvests this year have been pretty good. So you would expect that deflationary environment to exist for at least the next 12, probably 18 months," Mike Coupe, boss of UK grocer Sainsbury's, said in a recent results presentation. Low food inflation is toughest for mid-market players such as France's Carrefour and Britain's Tesco as it makes it harder for them to pass on rising wage and rental costs to shoppers, squeezing their profit margins. "Discounters have less wage impact, that is why it is a competitive weapon," said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former senior Tesco supply chain executive. "Low food inflation is good for the low-labor guys," he said, referring to the fact discounters employ fewer workers. The rise of discounters such as Germany's Aldi and Lidl and shoppers' heightened price sensitivity since the financial crisis has meant supermarket groups are struggling to keep any benefits from lower commodity costs for themselves. "If you looked at 2008, you’ll have seen an impact of some retailers taking advantage of price inflation through commodity price falls ... that's not a game we're going to play," said Andy Clarke of Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart. Asda, which has lower wage costs than its main rivals, was the first of Britain's leading grocers to cut prices, helping it stem the flow of shoppers to discounters. Carrefour, Europe's biggest retailer, said cheaper fruit and vegetables -- which make up 6 percent of sales in hypermarkets and 8 percent in supermarkets -- dragged down quarterly sales. Ahold, meanwhile, said the Russian import ban contributed to Dutch fruit and vegetable prices falling by 6-7 percent in the third quarter, although it sees that effect abating and has been helped by its exposure to the inflationary U.S. market. Executives expect the world's growing population to eventually prompt a recovery in global food prices, even if European price wars could still intensify. Lower prices are already helping sales volumes grow at their fastest pace since 2011, according to Nielsen, which expects volumes to rise further in the first quarter of 2015. A return of food inflation could drive a recovery in the sector, now the cheapest it has been relative to the broader market in 10 years, trading on 12-13 times forward earnings. "The last few times inflation was at these levels, the sector re-rated over the subsequent 12-18 months relative to market," said Citi analyst Pradeep Pratti. "We are getting closer to the point where a sector re-rating is increasingly looking likely."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's finance minister called for deep-rooted reforms to stamp out corruption in a military that collapsed in the face of an Islamic State advance, as he prepares to spend nearly a quarter of the 2015 budget on defense. Hoshiyar Zebari will push for about 23 percent of a proposed 2015 budget of $100 billion to be poured into defense and security when it is presented to Iraq's cabinet "very soon". Iraq has not published spending figures for this year, but according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Baghdad spent $7.9 billion on defense in 2013. The United States has also provided money and equipment since pulling the last of its forces out of Iraq in 2011. When Islamic State fighters swept through northern Iraq in June, they were almost unopposed by Iraqi soldiers. U.S.-led air strikes have since helped Iraqi forces retake some territory. While stressing that the security forces deserve support to counter what is seen as the world's most ruthless militant group, Zebari said tighter controls were needed. "Definitely we will recommend strongly that there should be some serious deep-rooted reforms in the military security establishment to fight corruption, mismanagement," he told Reuters in an interview conducted on Thursday. "But at the same time, the military has to be cleaned of all these numbers, figures of ghost soldiers and other mismanagement."  Ghost soldiers are enrolled men who do not turn up and fight but whose salaries go into the pockets of the commanders. The phenomenon has been associated with the collapse of the army during Islamic State's sweep through the north. "Definitely there has to be checks and balances. All the formations have to be reviewed in terms of the numbers. There should be no ghost members of the military," Zebari said. "People should be accountable. Your battalion, the number of your members should be accounted for, for weapons or salaries, for munitions for food. These are basic things it doesn’t need a genius (to understand)." Reuters Iraq's sectarian civil war, fueled by the ultra-hard line Sunni Muslim Islamic State, has complicated efforts to forge a military strategy against the insurgents. Aside from violence between majority Shi'ites and Sunnis, tensions between the Kurds in the semi-autonomous north and the Baghdad government have further fragmented the country. Zebari, a Kurd, said a recent deal with Baghdad had reduced frictions over Kurdish oil exports. Other reconciliation efforts are moving slowly, including plans to build a National Guard that can incorporate all sects and communities. "They are still in the realm of discussion, of exchanging ideas to finding the right formula to kicking off this project." Zebari does not have to look far for a reminder of the kind of damage Islamic State's predecessors, al Qaeda, inflicted in Iraq. A truck bomb close to the ministry killed at least 28 people in 2009. The finance minister said no one should expect magic results in the military and security forces, adding: "This will take time until the situation is stabilized, until they perform and show their capabilities in the battlefield." He seemed optimistic that the tide is turning in the war against Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria it controls. Zebari said the group could no longer engage in stand-up battles against Iraqi forces because any prolonged fighting makes them vulnerable to U.S. air strikes. But he warned that Islamic State was still highly effective at making and planting roadside bombs and booby-trapping houses. The group is also lethal because it can multi-task using conventional warfare, guerrilla tactics and suicide bomb squads. "After all these years nobody wants to see a caliphate of hatred. They are no longer an existential threat to our existence. They are still a very very serious threat," said Zebari. "How long it will take? I don’t have the crystal ball to tell you. It will take some time. I think we are winning, they are losing." (Editing by Catherine Evans) FREE AppDownload
Pop quiz! What’s a "zombie bank?" No, it’s not the latest Halloween costume to hit the shelves. It’s actually a term that’s used to describe insolvent banks that are being kept barely alive through government support or bailouts. If that phrase is new to you, you’re not alone. There are all sorts of economic terms that get tossed about in the news that don’t exactly lend themselves to intuitive understanding — making finance feel like an exclusive club with its own secret language. But New York Times best-selling author and journalist John Lanchester argues that everyone can — and should — be a part of the inner circle. In his new book, "How to Speak Money," Lanchester makes the case that everyone is capable of understanding how the economy works … as long as they can demystify all the acronyms and jargon. Since we’re all for helping people feel more confident about their finances, we sat down with Lanchester to learn more about his book — and even which concepts he finds confusing. John Lanchester: I’m an outsider myself to the world of finance and economics, and I found that the first obstacle to following this stuff was the vocabulary. It’s the first thing that gets in the way when you’re trying to learn, and it’s an essential tool to have in order to be engaged in the conversation. Finance can feel exclusive if you’re not following the thread. And that can make you feel powerless. The credit crunch during the recession was a very confusing time for me and for many others. We were all minding our own business, thinking that things were running along just fine — and suddenly there was this systemic convulsion (the recession, that is) that affected everyone. It was as if the global financial institute reached into everyone’s life and started messing with the settings. That was the moment when I felt an urgency to understand the world of finance — since there didn’t seem to be a system in place that I could really trust. RELATED: 6 Rookie Portfolio Mistakes Even Seasoned Investors Make Flickr / -Ben ThompsonFinancial terminology isn't intuitive, but some reading on the subject should help. It’s the fact that the terminology isn’t intuitive. Look at the plumbing industry, for example. It has its own jargon, and while you may not know the exact difference between a J-bend and a U-bend pipe, you can roughly figure out what they mean. But when I say "quantitative easing," well, there’s simply nothing there to help you understand what those terms mean — there’s no way in. It sounds bland, like a medication someone would take for constipation, but it’s actually a huge and slightly scary financial experiment. You have to go and find the explanation on your own. RELATED: 6 Ways Big-Picture Economic Trends Can Impact Your Wallet We could go round and round on that one and not get anywhere. You can’t prove it one way or another. There are some terms that financial professionals know in their bones and outsiders simply don’t. "Compound interest" is one. It’s not a complicated idea, but it’s one that insiders have in their DNA, so they toss it around without ever stopping to explain what it means. That’s an example not of deliberate exclusion but rather hard-wired, baked-in knowledge. But the important thing to consider here is the effect. If someone is talking about "vanilla mezzanine RMBS synthetic CDO," it doesn’t matter if the confusion is deliberate or not. The net effect is that you’re left feeling completely excluded. Editor’s note: Vanilla mezzanine RMBS synthetic CDO is a type of financial product that played a role in the subprime mortgage crisis. RMBS stands for residential mortgage-backed security, while CDO stands for collateralized debt obligation. How’s that for a mouthful? There’s a classic Peanuts Comic Strip cartoon where Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty are talking about that comfortable, safe feeling you get sleeping in the back of the car while your parents are in the front doing all of the driving and the worrying. And then, one day, all of a sudden it’s you in the front and there’s no going back. When it comes to the world of economics, right now we’re all in the front of the car. As we all learned during the recession, there’s no grown-up in charge. You have to take responsibility for your own economic choices. When people aren’t informed, the texture of our democracy thins. Democracy implies an informed electorate. And if we go into the ballot booth making decisions at random, that’s a problem. RELATED: Financial Power Trip: How to Show Your Money Who’s Boss Flickr/DellFinancial concepts, just like words, can be confusing. For one, there’s the relationship between credit and debt, which is really important and often misunderstood. The thing we call "credit" is really debt. It’s not a credit card, it’s a debt card. That’s not complicated or fancy, but understanding that is really just being honest with yourself. And then there are terms that, oddly enough, turn out to mean the opposite of what they sound like. For example, "securitization" sounds like a process that makes things safe. But what it really means is that you’re taking one big risk and spreading it into smaller risks. Let’s say I lend you money. I have to think really hard about whether you can pay me back. But I don’t need to worry about the risk if I securitize the loan, which means I transfer the loan to others and get paid back immediately. Now the borrower is paying back the people I transferred the loan to. But that breaks down the link between the lender and the borrower. This happened a lot during the recession — and people were given loans that they could never pay back. So, in this case, securitization wasn’t very secure at all. RELATED: Mortgages 101: What You Need to Know There should be increased transparency between experts and consumers. During the financial crisis, the riskiest and least understood product, a subprime mortgage, was sold to the least informed consumers. That sounds crazy, but it’s normal. There isn’t enough consumer protection at the point of sale, so everyone needs to adopt an increased sense that they are responsible for their own education. What I found works is simply following what happens day to day in the news. Every time you don’t understand a term, look it up. Over time you will build up a map of terminology. And pretty soon you’ll be able to look at the paper and understand what you’re reading, and then you can form an opinion about whether you think the information that’s being presented to you is reasonable.

REUTERS/Jason ReedMohamed El-ErianJudging from today’s sharp reaction, the oil market is surprised by OPEC’s decision not to reduce its production ceiling in order to curtail the accelerated price decline which now totals 25% for the year. It shouldn’t be. OPEC has a history of opting for strategic rather than tactical decisions; and, this time around, it may have done so from a position of caution rather than overwhelming strength. OPEC’s tactical decision would have been to cut its output ceiling as a means of limiting supply to the world energy market and, thus, boosting prices. But the impact of such a cut would have been less than in the past given the declining importance of OPEC oil in the global energy equation. Moreover, it is far from obvious that certain OPEC members would have abided by such a decision – especially countries facing significant financing issues (such as Venezuela). Then there are the strategic considerations. Due to both technology innovations (such as those impacting shale energy) and environmental considerations, the oil industry faces significant secular headwinds. A sustained decline in oil prices, while causing short-term pain for producers, serves to alleviate some of these headwinds – first, and foremost, by making some of the alternative energy sources less commercially viable. Such a decline also imposes pain on non-OPEC oil producers. Finally, let’s not forget that there are historical precedents to such strategic behaviors, including from the late 1990s when Saudi Arabia decided to no longer play the role of swing producer. The immediate impact was a precipitous decline in oil prices – but one that placed OPEC in a better position for the subsequent 10-plus years. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Alexander Natruskin Leonid FedunOil prices are plunging on Thanksgiving in the US as the latest OPEC meeting saw the oil cartel announce that it will not cut production.  And one Russian oil tycoon thinks OPEC is on a mission to get rid of the "marginal" oil players in the US shale market. According to a report from Bloomberg's Will Kennedy and Jillian Ward, Leonid Fedun — vice president and board member at Russian oil giant OAO Lukoil — said: "The shale boom is on par with the dot-com boom. The strong players will remain, the weak ones will vanish." On Thursday morning, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were below $70 for the first time in more than four years following news out of Thursday's OPEC meeting that the oil cartel would not cut production to combat a global supply glut that has been blamed for the sharp decline in oil prices in recent months. Russia, however, is not an OPEC member. Many have attributed the increase in global oil supply to increased production from US shale producers, which has ramped up sharply in the last couple years. Fedun said that OPEC's objective is to "clean up" the US shale market, and that oil prices will eventually rise once this occurs.  "In 2016, when OPEC completes this objective of cleaning up the American marginal market, the oil price will start growing again," Fedun told Bloomberg. And regarding Thursday's announcement from OPEC, Fedun told Bloomberg, "The major strike is against the American market." Fedun told Bloomberg that some US producers are surviving right now because they hedged their oil production at $90 a barrel, though these arrangements will eventually expire making life "much more difficult" for these companies. Back in late October, we highlighted comments from Morgan Stanley analysts who said that "unconventional" US oil producers would likely face pressure turning a profit at around $76-$77 a barrel.  Following news out of OPEC's meeting, WTI crude fell below $70 for the first time since June 2010.

Effective layering is ridiculously important, especially as we get deeper and deeper into winter. Ideally, you’d have a heavy-duty parka for the coldest temperatures and wind chills, but even if you’re just getting by with what you have, you can still stay relatively warm and dry. Here are some clothes I grabbed from my closet. This is pretty typical of what I’d wear on a casual day in late autumn / early winter when running errands, meeting up with friends, or just hanging out. Effortless Gent(Denim: Levi’s 508 regular taper; Shirt: J.Crew Cotton Twill (other styles); Vest: J.Crew Factory Quilted Vest; Coat: Waxed Cotton Field Jacket (similar); Boots: Chippewa 6<U+2033> Moc Toe Wedge; Socks: Gray/Black Herringbone cotton socks (similar); Beanie: Gray cashmere (similar); Gloves: basic cotton (similar); Scarf: charcoal plaid (similar) The photo above is just a sampling of what I picked from my closet that day. You may not have these exact items, and even if you did, you may not be in the mood to wear them, or feel inclined to combine them in the way I did. The good thing is, you can swap out lots of items for similar things in your wardrobe. OCBD <U+2194> flannel vest <U+2194> denim jacket <U+2194> sweater <U+2194> cardigan leather boots <U+2194> bean boots <U+2194> lace-ups beanie <U+2194> trapper <U+2194> wool fedora cotton gloves <U+2194> leather gloves <U+2194> fur-lined gloves M-65 field jacket <U+2194> wool pea coat <U+2194> puffer coat <U+2194> parka If sweaters are more your thing than quilted vests, go with that. Raining outside, and you don’t want to ruin your new leather boots? Swap them out for Bean Boots instead. Prefer a more formal look? Go with a wool fedora over a beanie. You get the idea. Effortless GentStart with the thinnest layers at the bottom, and wear the thickest layers furthest away from your skin. So of course your underoos would be first, then a T-shirt or undershirt (if you wear those), followed by your button-up shirt (a thick cotton twill plaid, in my case) and denim, then any mid layers (quilted vest, as you can see above), accessories (such as scarf, glove, hat), then finally, your shoes and outerwear. Easy on, easy off: Layers are great because you can peel them off one by one as you get warm, or add them as needed when the temperatures drop. Contrast that with wearing just a T-shirt + your heavy coat. I’ve been in situations where temperatures suddenly change and keeping a coat on would make me overheat, but a single layer wouldn’t be warm enough, either. Layers are key. Bulkiness: Going from thinner to thicker layers helps to keep bulkiness down to a minimum. If you have too many bulky items (or thinner items over bulky items), it’s not easy to just peel off the layers you need to keep your temperature regulated. Ease/Range of movement: Layering in this way helps with range of movement. Generally, your thick coat is tougher to maneuver in than your heavy cable-knit cardigan, which is tougher to maneuver in than your shirt, etc. Insulation: Consider investing in long underwear or other garments that keep you insulated. For workouts, I use these Nike compression leggings which keep you warm, and if the need arises this winter, I won’t hesitate to wear these under my denim. Uniqlo has a line of undershirts and leggings called Heattech that I also plan on trying out, though I’m not much of an undershirt guy. Know thyself. In the end, you know yourself best. I get warm fairly quickly, especially if I’m walking a lot (which you tend to do in NYC), so I may not wear as many layers as, say, my wife, who gets cold easily. If you are always cold (and stay that way, despite the activities you’re participating in), then add the layers you need to stay comfortable. It may take some trial and error, and of course, will depend on the weather, but you’ll figure it out in no time. Just remember, it’s better to over-layer; you can always take off a couple things if you start to overheat. This article originally appeared at Effortless Gent.  Copyright 2014.

HELSINKI/ MADRID (Reuters) - Failure to reform and shield weaker members threatens to divide the euro zone, the head of the European Central Bank warned on Thursday, amid fresh signs the currency bloc's economy is losing speed. Delivering a blunt message to political leaders, Mario Draghi urged the 18 countries that share the single currency to consider ways to support struggling members, warning of the perils should fears that some might quit the euro be revived. "Lack of structural reforms raises the specter of permanent economic divergence between members," Draghi told an audience at the University of Helsinki, choosing unusually frank language. "And insofar as this threatens the essential cohesion of the Union, this has potentially damaging consequences for all." Draghi's remarks were not limited to reforms in individual countries but also encouraged a rethink of a basic principle underlying the fractious currency alliance -- that strong countries are not obliged to help weak ones. His comments came as the economic clouds over the region darkened. Lending in the euro zone shrivelled further in October while price inflation, a key yardstick of economic health, is very low. Annual price inflation in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy by far, slowed to 0.5 percent in November, its lowest in nearly five years. Spanish consumer prices also dropped for the fifth month running.  Yet enforcing order across the politically divided region in areas such as government spending has proven difficult. On Friday, the European Commission will tell France and Italy -- the bloc's second and third-largest economies -- and smaller Belgium that their 2015 budgets risk breaking EU rules. Nowhere is the contrast between north and south more visible than with France, which has put off reforms, and Germany, committed to not spending more than it earns. "The biggest danger we see right now is a period of window-dressing where lip service is paid to grand projects and reforms, but no real steps are taken," leading French and German economists said on Thursday as they proposed a package of reforms and investment. Draghi's message comes less than a week after he pledged to take further steps if needed to shore up the flagging euro zone economy and weeks ahead of a meeting of European leaders in Brussels to consider measures to bolster growth in the region. Draghi would like them to break with the tradition of protecting national interests first and foremost, by forming a united front that would support the bloc's economic weaklings. Unlike the United States, the euro zone does not have a system of 'fiscal transfers' by which richer members such as Germany can aid poorer states such as Greece. "Countries need to invest more in other mechanisms to share the cost of shocks," Draghi said. "Some form of cross-country risk-sharing is essential to help reduce adjustment costs for those countries and prevent recessions from leaving deep and permanent scars." Draghi even broached the sensitive issue of creating what he called "some form of backstop for sovereign debt", a possible reference to joint guarantees for new debt. Such ideas are strongly opposed by Germany, the euro zone's biggest and strongest member, whose politicians fear it could be left on the hook for reckless borrowing by other countries. Earlier, the ECB warned in a report of the risks that investors were taking in the hunt for return. It cited 'froth' in property prices, although Draghi said such bubbles would not stop the ECB from loosening its purse strings if required.   (Writing by John O'Donnell; Additional reporting by Jonathan Gould in Frankfurt and Paul Taylor in Paris; Editing by Catherine Evans) FREE AppDownload

Crude oil just broke $70 for the first time since June 2010. West Texas Intermediate crude futures sank below $70 after Thursday's OPEC meeting resulted in the oil cartel announcing that it will not cut production. On Thursday, WTI futures were down as low as $68.90, a more than 6% decline in the last 24 hours following the news. The recent slide in oil prices has been attributed, among other things, to a global supply glut. Brent crude oil futures, considered the global benchmark, were also down more than 5% on Thursday to below $73 a barrel. And from the folks at Bespoke Investment Group, here's some context on just how huge the recent decline in WTI prices has been.

Amazon.comProfessional economists spend lots of time mulling over government stats on the economy. Popular indicators include the consumer price index and the nonfarm payrolls report. However, these official reports are always revised, sometimes by amounts so large we wonder why we pay attention to them at all. Fortunately, we live in an era where massive amounts of information flows freely. And some savvy economists have flagged some seriously unorthodox indicators that reveal the truth about what's really going on in the economy. Many of us are familiar with some of these indicators like the Big Mac Index and the lipstick indicator. However, there are even weirder indicators like Kenyan Coca-Cola revenues, alligator populations, cheap romance novel sales, and the intensity of military recruitment ads that are arguably sound in their economic revelations. Business Insider has compiled a list of the 54 most unusual ones. Take a look. Eric Platt, Matthew Boesler, and Steven Perlberg contributed to an earlier version of this article. FREE AppDownload
If real life imitated TV perfectly, law would be an intellectually stimulating and exciting career path for everyone. You work with high-profile clients, try intense cases, make massive M&amp;A deals happen, and empower the barbarians at the gate. Except… that doesn’t quite hold up in real life. The average corporate law job turns into a game of “How many documents can you turn, and how quickly and accurately can you turn them? Bonus points if you’re skilled with the Table of Contents feature in Word.” Some lawyers play that game and move up the ladder, while others get bored, conclude that business is more interesting, and move into roles with more modeling and fewer “Track Changes.” Whenever deal activity heats up and banks ramp up their hiring, more and more professionals fall into that category and move from law to investment banking. I’ve seen that firsthand because there has been a big uptick in the number of readers and customers making that move in the past year. A cynic might say, “We’re at the peak! If so many career changers are getting in, the bubble is about to burst!” Maybe. But even when deal activity and hiring are down, a fair number of lawyers break in – and here’s how you do it: Why? Didn’t You Already Write About This? Yes – in fact, it was one of the first articles ever published on M&amp;I. But that was a long time ago, things have changed since then, and that feature was a very “high-level” overview. This time around, I’m basing the article on several interviews with readers and clients who have moved from law to finance. If you haven’t already read it, that article above is a good “101” guide to this topic – but we’re going into more specific tips and advice here. Starting Points: Becoming a Barbarian at the Gate Let’s start with a basic, but often-overlooked point: you need to make sure you’re going into IB, or any other finance role, for the right reasons first. A lot of lawyers think, “This job is boring and I’m intellectually under-stimulated… but bankers make a lot more money, so I should do finance instead!” That is a poor reason to make the move because banking and law are very different professions. If you’re a lawyer, work is “handed” to you; you can get ahead by virtue of being smart and hard-working, and by turning documents successfully. You won’t necessarily be responsible for bringing in clients until you’re at the top, or very close to the top. But as a banker you start wining and dining clients much earlier on, and the job changes significantly once you hit the VP level. If you don’t like sales and schmoozing with clients, you really shouldn’t move into banking. The stories of the most successful law –&gt; banking career changers I spoke with all looked something like: If you do NOT have a story like that or you cannot point to longer-term interest in finance, put on your “spin” hat and come up with something. Or start learning more now and think about transitioning only when your story is more credible, whether that takes 1 year, 2 years, or more. How Much Do Your Firm and Group Matter? I wrote previously that it’s “difficult to break in if you’re not in corporate law.” This one is not quite true. Several lawyers-turned-bankers mentioned litigators and even patent and environmental lawyers getting in: it all depends on how good a story you can spin. For example, if you did environmental law perhaps you worked on cases that were related to due diligence in deals (e.g., was there a toxic spill right behind the company’s headquarters? Did this come up when a private equity firm was evaluating a company?). If you’re in a seemingly unrelated group, switching to corporate law first sounds like a good idea. But there’s also an opportunity cost because you need to spend time recruiting for a new group, and then work in that group for some time so you have experience to speak to. Plus, if you move into that new group and then fail to get into banking you’re left in an awkward position: do you move back to your original group? Or stay there? Or just open a surf shop in Brazil? On the other hand, there was universal agreement that working at a brand-name firm gives you a big advantage. The bulge bracket banks know the top law firms, but they’re much less aware of smaller firms. So if you’re at a smaller firm: Preparing to Recruit So you’re at a top firm, or you’re targeting smaller banks, and you have a story that reflects at least a few years of interest in finance… what next? Before you network with anyone, you need to master 2 important points: 1. Your Story – See the example above for an outline. You cannot just say you became interested very recently; it has to be an evolution over years. You also need to emphasize that banking IS your long-term career, and you’re not just doing it because you’re “bored” with law. Many lawyers sabotage themselves by including too many negatives in their story. It’s not a surprise, really: you’re trained to find problems, flaws, and points of contention, so your story often ends up sounding negative. For example, one coaching client made this statement as part of his initial story: “I’ve enjoyed my work in this corporate law team, but I’ve gotten frustrated because business-oriented questions never get answered. They always say, ‘It’s a business decision, it’s not our realm’ and we’re not responsible for the key points that clients care about.” This statement is not a faux pas, but it sounds quite negative. It’s better to say something like, “In addition to advising on the legal issues, I want to contribute to the actual deal process and move transactions forward – which you have the opportunity to do in banking.” It’s a small change, but if you come across as “negative” in the first 2 minutes that impression will stick with you. 2. The Technicals – They will ask you technical questions from the beginning, even incasual informational interviews, because they assume that lawyers are bad at math. So you need to know accounting, valuation, and transaction modeling before you contact anyone. They do not care AT ALL about your background, and they also don’t care AT ALL how senior you are. I have seen stories of 7th year law associates with dozens of deals getting rejected from IB roles because they couldn’t answer questions about the 3 financial statements. Yes, it will take time to learn this material via online courses, books, in-person classes, or however else you want to approach it, which creates a problem: how do you get that kind of time? Answer #1: Secondments and Rotational Programs Many of the top law firms have rotational programs for new hires, so you might move through capital markets, M&amp;A, real estate, tax, and other groups. There are often breaks or “secondments” (where you work for a normal company temporarily) in between, where you get a reduced workload… and therefore time to learn the technical skills and network. Answer #2: Take Your Time If you don’t have this opportunity, spread out your learning over a longer time period. Maybe it will take you 6 months instead of 2-3 weeks, but it’s really not rocket science, at least not the part you need for interviews. Many lawyers mistakenly: Neither is a good strategy. Plus, taking more time to learn these skills just makes your story more credible. Networking Into Investment Banking: How to Become Shameless Some people online will say that you need at least “several years of experience” to break into IB, but many stories contradict this. As with any other career transition, the sooner the better. It’s doable with only 1-2 years of full-time experience, and sometimes even less than 1 year. Headhunters tend to be useless, so you should focus on alumni from undergrad and law school, plus former co-workers. Do NOT ignore junior bankers – they can’t get you interviews/offers, but they can give you lots of information on the group, and they can introduce you to more senior people on the team. If you do know someone more senior on the team (e.g., a Group Head), yes, contact that person first. But if you don’t know anyone, contact an analyst first and then ask to be put in touch with an associate, then a VP, and so on, and move up the ladder like that. Helpful vs. Useless Contacts Former lawyers from your own firm, followed by former lawyers from other firms, will be your most helpful connections. Networking is all about follow-up, and you’ll always get a significantly higher response rate from quick, 1-2 sentence follow-up emails sent after your initial email. Do not underestimate the randomness of opportunities, and don’t limit yourself to specific groups at banks. Yes, technically you have a better chance in groups with some legal overlap, likeRestructuring, but… I’ve also seen lawyers reach out to contacts they haven’t spoken to in years, find out the contact is in an unrelated division, ask about anyone he/she knows in IB, and ultimately get interviews like that. So ideally you’ll contact bankers first, but if not, reaching out to people in other divisions at any large bank can work well. What to Expect When Networking: “Objection, Your Honor!” You need to be careful to avoid negativity in your story, and it’s the same when networking. Even if you’ve emailed someone dozens of times and you haven’t heard back, you cannot let it get to you or you’ll never make any progress. It can also be tough to convince bankers that you’d be comfortable doing the job since law is perceived as being dramatically different. You can counter this objection by knowing the technical side very well, and even bringing in your own models and valuations… IF you know your stuff. You can start most conversations with a simple “So what advice do you have for a lawyer moving into investment banking?” and go from there; networking is networking even in a career change. How to Interview Like You’re a New Star on Suits Assuming you’ve done well and progressed to more formal interviews, you’re in for a ride because they vary quite a bit. In rare cases, bankers will ask no technical questions… but then in equally rare cases, you might get a valuation / modeling case study. On average, though, the “fit” questions are very predictable (“Why are you switching into finance? Why now? Why banking?”) and the technical questions are quite standard (depreciation changing by $10, linking the statements, etc.). Even if you somehow happen to get a case study, it’s usually of the form: “Here’s an annual and interim report – build a 3-statement model and valuation for the company, along with the football field graph at the end.” So it is time-consuming, but it doesn’t require a huge amount of critical analysis, and, again, this is very rare from all the accounts I’ve seen. You should also be prepared to discuss the business details of your cases. Two examples from previous coaching clients come to mind: So it’s not enough to know a few stats about the purchase price and the valuation – you can and will be grilled on more detailed numbers. If you don’t know this information for the deals and clients listed on your resume, find it and make sure you can comfortably speak to these numbers. The hiring process itself, similar to lateral hiring anywhere, can be prolongedbecause banks are under no time pressure to hire you. After your interviews begin, it might take anywhere from 1-2 months up to 6 months to win an offer. Case Closed: An Offer as an IB Associate? If you perform well and receive an offer, you’ll most likely join as a 1st or 2nd year Associate. If you have a lot more experience, e.g. you are a 7th year Associate up for promotion to Partner, you might move in at a slightly higher level, but you’d never move in as a Managing Director. Think: “Beyond a 1st or 2nd year Associate, but still not at the VP-level, unless it’s a smaller bank or a smaller regional office of a bank.” You may also end up taking a pay cut depending on your current level; for example, 1st and 2nd year IB Associates might earn 50-60% of what 7th year Associates at top corporate law firms earn. You’ll move up and match that pay fairly quickly if you do well, but you need to be psychologically ready for this drop. What If It Didn’t Work: Demanding a Retrial If you made it through interviews but did not get an offer, you need to pinpoint why by asking the interviewers directly. The most common reasons I’ve seen include: If it’s the first reason, you can’t do much other than continue to interview around at different firms. But if it’s the second reason, potentially you could go back to them and make your case again, if you’re confident you do have the skills. This tends to work better on the sales &amp; trading side, but it can also work here if they’re wrong and you have enough evidence to prove it. The Law to Investment Banking Roadmap So if you’re sitting in a frustrating law job right now and you’ve always wanted to get into finance, follow everything above and nail your story and the technical side, network without shame, and interview like you’re on TV to break in. And if it doesn’t work the first time around, you can always go for the “retrial” option. Just try not to make a habit of it. A controversial case may make for the most popular podcast of all time, but it doesn’t work quite as well when it’s your own story. This story was originally published by&nbsp;Mergers & Inquisitions.

Crude oil dropped sharply after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) elected not to cut oil production. FinvizWTI crude. Both Brent and WTI crude prices fell heavily after the meeting with Brent dropping below $72 a barrel and WTI falling to $68 for the first time since 2010 after the Kuwait oil minister told journalists that the cartel's oil production target would remain unchanged at 30 million barrels a day. Here's a link to the full OPEC statement but below is the key passage (emphasis added): The Conference also noted, importantly, that, although world oil demand is forecast to increase during the year 2015, this will, yet again, be offset by the projected increase of 1.36 mb/d in non-OPEC supply. The increase in oil and product stock levels in OECD countries, where days of forward cover are comfortably above the five-year average, coupled with the on-going rise in non-OECD inventories, are indications of an extremely well-supplied market. Recording its concern over the rapid decline in oil prices in recent months, the Conference concurred that stable oil prices – at a level which did not affect global economic growth but which, at the same time, allowed producers to receive a decent income and to invest to meet future demand – were vital for world economic wellbeing. Accordingly, in the interest of restoring market equilibrium, the Conference decided to maintain the production level of 30.0 mb/d, as was agreed in December 2011. This looks likely to be the official OPEC target until at least the middle of next year, with officials announcing that the next meeting is planned for June 2015. TwitterOne theory for why OPEC is allowing prices to fall is that the cartel (and particularly Saudi Arabia — it's largest member) is attempting to fight off competition from US shale oil and maintain its share of the US market. Keeping prices below $100 a barrel will put pressure on higher cost US shale producers and will prevent further erosion of OPEC's position in the Americas. It would be a difficult task. As Ed Conway, Sky's economics editor, said on Twitter the US has not see as large an increase in its domestic oil production as it has achieved in the last few years since the 1920s. The additional supply has overwhelmed reduced production from OPEC members over the last couple of years. Not since the 1920s has the US seen such a rapid, continuous increase in crude oil production pic.twitter.com/bqBwvMc42C However, there may be a more fundamental shift going on in the oil market at the moment. The problem for OPEC is that it may no longer be able to control prices (as it has in the past) to avoid these problems. Previously, OPEC members would agree to cut oil production if falling prices posed a threat. That may now have changed because of the shale oil boom in the US, which has dramatically increased supply. As Goldman Sachs wrote in a recent note (emphasis added): [There is a] realisation that the OPEC reaction function has changed and that the US shale barrel is now likely the first swing barrel ... When Saudi Arabia cut prices to Asia for November delivery it was interpreted as a shift in the Saudi reaction function to a focus on market share. This should have not been a surprise in the new world of shale that has flattened the supply curve, as economic game theory suggests that they should not be the first mover and that the US shale barrel should be the new swing barrel given how easily it can be scaled up and down. That is, OPEC may simply not want to reveal just how weak its hand is. The rouble is crashing on the news briefly crossing 48 roubles to the dollar: BloombergDollar vs the rouble. Russia's currency is particularly sensitive to movements in the oil prices, especially after the Russian central bank announced that it would no longer intervene in currency markets to prop up its value.

OSLO, Norway -- Kristian Midtoy is a kindergarten chef in downtown Oslo. Not a cook but a chef, whose specialties range from salmon sashimi to roasted venison and whose 100 customers range in age from 1 to 6. His open kitchen area, which forms the center of the daycare, is constantly invaded by happy, hungry, and inquisitive children. "We have lots of space so they can sit for a long time and enjoy the meal," Midtoy says. "And I try to take in a lot of whole animals with fur and whole fish and live crabs and lobsters, so they see that all the kinds of animals that we eat are not just packs in the stores. [The kids] are so curious and interested to see new things." Even in Norway, the world's fourth-richest country by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a gourmet kindergarten is unusual. But in a country where 80 percent of the kindergarten cost is subsidized by the state, the additional $116 a month that parents pay for the gourmet cuisine is something just about any parent can afford. Particularly when salaries in Norway, which is not a European Union member, are 50 percent higher than the average in the EU. That Norway should be so wealthy is no surprise. It is the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, with annual oil revenues of around $40 billion, plus a vibrant and diversified economy that spreads prosperity widely within the society. In surveys of income inequality, Norway always ranks as one of the countries with the least differences of income between its citizens in the world. And that is what sets it apart from many oil-producing countries, particularly in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. There oil generates revenues that make the governing elites fabulously wealthy, while the rest of the citizens depend on their leaders' handouts or upon trickle-down economics for their share of what is left. Charles Recknagel (RFE/RL)Kristian Midtoy serves up gourmet dishes like salmon sashimi at a kindergarten in Oslo. How Norway manages its oil wealth could offer some valuable lessons for such countries. And to learn how Norway has been so successful is as easy as leaving Oslo and flying 50 minutes west to the North Sea port city of Stavanger, the capital of the country's offshore oil industry. Lifting The Economy Until oil was discovered in 1969, Stavanger was a fishing town whose best times had been a decades-long boom in herring fishing that ended suddenly with plunging catches after 1870. The collapse had left the town, like the rest of Norway, with a huge fleet of wooden sailing ships and an agricultural economy that was fast being left behind by its rapidly industrializing neighbors. But oil changed everything. "In 1960, the standard of living in Norway was about 30 or 40 percent lower than in Sweden or in Denmark," says Bruno Gerard an economist at the Norwegian Business School in Oslo. "Now the standard of living in Norway is substantially higher than in those two countries." The signs of how much prosperity oil has created are all around Stavanger, which has grown from a town of 90,000 people in the 1960s to a municipal region with a population of nearly 204,000 today. Moored in Stavanger's harbor are huge ships, built in the region's shipyards, which carry supplies to the oil platforms offshore. Within the city limits are a new 10,000-student university, a new concert hall, and several museums. Outside the city there is a vast greenhouse, growing fresh tomatoes even during the darkest winter days by using artificial light. There are similar scenes up and down Norway's west coast, where a total of 70 oil platforms are in operation from the southern tip to the polar north. The platforms themselves, which belong to Norway's majority state-owned oil companies or foreign concessionaires, employ only a small number of people. But the drilling and production requires supporting activities that involves virtually every other sector and lifts the rest of the economy like a rising tide. Dutch Disease But if Norway's oil industry has made the country's population of 5 million people rich, it was not guaranteed from the start to do so. Many other countries have discovered that oil can wreck havoc on their economies by creating a wealthy energy-export sector while disrupting or even bankrupting other export sectors. The phenomenon is known as "Dutch disease" after what happened when Netherlands discovered huge natural-gas deposits in the North Sea in the 1960s and it almost happened to Norway as well. Living in Stavanger is a man who has witnessed Norway's oil history from its very start. He is Iraqi-born Farouk al-Kasim, who began his career as a petroleum geologist in Basra but moved to Norway around the age of 30 with his Norwegian wife in order to get sustained medical treatment their son. When he came to Norway in 1968, the country's first oil strike was still a year away. But he soon got a temporary job with the country's fledgling Oil Ministry because the foreign companies it had licensed to look for oil were sending in reams of promising reports and there were very few people in the government who could evaluate them. The job became permanent and from 1973 to 1991 he managed Norway's petroleum resources before retiring to become an international oil consultant. When the first oil began to flow, Kasim remembers, the Norwegians' reaction was the same as that of any country that suddenly strikes black gold. People viewed the sudden windfall of oil revenues as an unqualified blessing. The money poured straight into the government budget, and public spending rose. But by 1972, it was clear the economy was in deep trouble. "Norway had four years of Dutch disease, where wages went up, factories lost their top people to the oil industry, and foreigners coming in to invest in the oil boom drove up the value of the currency so high that customers in other countries could no longer afford Norway's other export products," he says. "Initially, the government reacted by handing out subsidies and we went deeper into the mire." By 1976, Kasim says, the damage had put the fear of being hit by a tsunami of oil money deep into Norwegian hearts. The country decided to do what Iraq and many other oil-producing states never do: deliberately limit how much oil revenue enters the economy. Initially, the government decided to take all the profits generated by its state-owned oil companies and reinvest them in searching for and producing more oil. But by 1995, the flood of income had grown beyond what this could absorb. So, Norway created a special buffer fund to keep the oil profits out of the economy by declaring them the property of future generations of Norwegians. The government forbid itself from using more than 4 percent of the money for current infrastructure and other public projects and invested the rest in financial markets abroad, effectively sending it into exile. Staying Afloat One of the landmarks of Stavanger's port is a low modern building with a tower on one side which, on closer inspection, turns out to be a partial replica of an oil platform. The building is the Norwegian Petroleum Museum, built in the late 1990s to tell the public about the country's most important resource. Some 10,000 to 12,000 students visit it a year in school groups. The museum has many interesting exhibits about underwater drilling technology. But one of its most memorable sights is an oversized digital counter whose rapidly spinning numbers resemble a clock in overdrive. It counts in real time how much oil money has been accumulating in Norway's buffer fund since 1995 instead of going into the current economy. The clock today shows more than $890 billion. That is the equivalent ofsome $170,000 for every one of the country's citizens. Officially, the money is earmarked for paying state pensions as Norway faces a balloon of retirements among aging baby boomers. But it's more immediate purpose is assure that Norway does not become too dependent upon its oil industry for its wealth that it loses its ability to compete later when the oil money runs out. So far, the theory seems to be working well. Charles Recknagel (RFE/RL)A net shaped like a fish bowl contains more than 200,000 salmon being raised for market. Food pellets are provided through hoses. Just 45 minutes by ferry from Stavanger is a salmon farm of the kind that helps make Norway the second-largest seafood exporter in the world. It consists of a wooden houseboat floating in the mouth of a fjord where five men tend three enormous nets floating like fish bowls in the icy water. Inside each net, which is 20 meters across and 35 meters deep, are 207,000 fish constantly circling and searching for food. During every eight-hour shift, the men dump 21 tons of food pellets into the nets until, after two years, the fish have grown large enough for market. Nearby, on the island of Jutaberg, is Martin Steiness, a biologist with a company that supplies services to Norway's aquaculture sector. Swimming in tanks in a large, wet hall are some of his research subjects. They include a cute green creature called a lumpfish, which today has good commercial prospects because it eats sea lice off of captive salmon. Steiness knows all about how too much oil money can skew an economy and drive sectors like his out of business. That's because even with the buffer fund, some symptoms of Dutch disease remain in the economy. He says the seafood industry cannot afford to pay the high wages that oil companies can, making it tough for other sectors to get the top talent they need. "In the aquaculture industry, most people working on sea farms don't need higher education," he says. "But in management you would need higher education and it is on that level that the competition is apparent." Charles Recknagel (RFE/RL)Research biologist Martin Steiness studies lumpfish, a useful creature that eats sea lice off of captive salmon. Still, so long as Dutch disease is contained, the seafood sector can thrive and perhaps even emerge stronger from the pressure. Entrepreneurs are forced to be creative in seeking out high-end markets that can offset Norway's high wages and everybody seems to be on the lookout for new opportunities. Steiness takes a visitor into a backroom to show off what he believes could be one of those opportunities: farm-raised sea urchins, whose eggs are popular as caviar in sushi restaurants. He hopes to unlock the secret of how to mass breed them. When The Oil Runs Dry But if today Norway's buffer fund allows the country to maintain a highly diversified economy, it also prepares for a future when, inevitably, the oil will run dry. Bjorn Vidar Loeren of the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association has an office in a business park on the edge of Stavanger that is entirely filled by oil companies and supporting firms. Here, they are well aware that the output from Norway's oil fields has been declining since 2000, even with the discovery of a massive new field in 2011. Loeren says the oil could run out in another 50 years but that natural-gas reserves should last longer: another 100 years at least. But no one knows for sure. Some other oil experts, like Kasim, estimate the oil could run out in as little as 30 years and gas in 50. Still, like other Norwegians, Loeren is not unduly worried that one day the energy bonanza will end. So much money keeps pouring into the country's pension fund that in the future it will do far more than just cover retirements, it will also provide the country capital for developing new industries when the oil runs dry. "Norwegian politicians have been very clever, very disciplined, so the day the oil age will end there will be money that can be converted into something else," Loeren says. "I think it is a fair concept to share the revenues from oil over a number of generations rather than spending everything up front." Few other oil-rich states will be in as enviable a position. Several, including Russia, also have buffer funds to reduce the effects of Dutch disease in their economies. But the difference is that Norway treats its fund as sacred while Moscow readily dips into its own when it needs extra cash. According to Norway's central bank, the net oil revenues of both Norway and Russia averaged around 15 percent of GDP during that time between 1998 and 2013. However, while the total Norway had accumulated in its fund by 2013 amounted to about 200 percent of its annual GDP, the total in Russia's fund equaled just 20 percent of annual GDP. How did Norway become so effective at managing its oil wealth? Some of the answer lies in Norway's history as a small nation with egalitarian traditions that go back as far as the Viking age, when groups of free men banded together under a charismatic leader to take part in sea trading and raiding expeditions and then share the profits. Knud Knudsen, a sociologist at Stavanger University, says that such traditions, reinforced by laws during the industrial age to assure the sharing of natural resources, like waterfalls, helped give rise to today's society, which puts much emphasis on social programs that equally benefit all citizens. But he says that it is all made possible by the fact that Norwegians have a high level of trust in their fellow citizens and those they elect to hold office. Norway routinely tops surveys ranking the world's countries in citizens' trust in their government and institutions as well as for general contentment with their lives. That could mean that the Norwegian model would not work as well in many countries where there is a less strong sense of social contract. But Norway's experience could still provide some valuable lessons. Kasim, the international oil consultant, says the trick for other countries, particularly emerging economies, is not to try to save as much oil income as Norway does. Instead, many countries need to invest in infrastructure if they are to grow. They may also need to create stabilization funds to protect their still undiversified economies from wild swings in the price of oil. But, he says, they will have to learn to save, not spend, much of their oil wealth if they are to protect themselves against Dutch disease and give other nonoil sectors the chance to grow and employ more people. What happens when they do not, he notes, is called the "oil curse." Countries become so full dependent upon their oil income that all other business dies and their rulers stay in power through handouts to loyalists and crackdowns on opponents. In the worst case, the oil finally simply becomes a prize for one powerful group to try to wrest from another, until the once oil-rich state becomes a failed state and there are no winners, only losers.

In the middle of November, the CEO of Vodafone Vittorio Colao warned of a "prisoner's dilemma" in the efforts to offer bundled television and broadband services. It makes sense for a company to seek unique content to differentiate it from others. However, if all the providers try to secure exclusive content, it triggers an arms race of sorts as they all do the same thing or risk losing out. Colao does not think that securing unique content is necessarily the long-term winning strategy, but if others are starting buying content providers, then it may force him to do the same. There is another prisoner's dilemma unfolding.The oil producing cartel will be 55 years old next year. It is not clear, but it may be experiencing an existential crisis. Its share of the world oil production has fallen with the rise of non-OPEC sources, like Russia, Norway, the UK, Canada, and significantly in recent years, increasingly the US. In addition to the external threat, OPEC faces internal challenges. There is a divergence of perceptions of national interest by the political elite. Indeed, Middle East politics is arguably incomprehensible without appreciating the tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Generally speaking, OPEC countries have tended to fall into one of two groups. The first has greater oil reserves lower relative to population. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the obvious examples. The second has relatively less oil and more people. Iran and Iraq are examples. This has often created conflicting strategies. The former wants to protect the value of their reserves by discouraging alternatives, which means relatively low prices. The latter want to maximize their current value. OPEC, like all cartels, have governance or enforcement challenges. It long faced difficulty ensuring that the production agreements and quotas are respected. By OPEC's own reckoning, there is often production in excess of the prevailing agreement. Last month, while oil prices were falling, OPEC says that it produced 30.25 mln barrels a day, which is 250k barrels a day over the production agreement. This may under-estimate OPEC's production. Iran, for example, appears to be selling greater amounts of (condensate) oil than the sanctions allow. The prisoner's dilemma is both within OPEC and without. For the Saudis to continue to act as the swing producer, it would mean the surrender of revenue and market share to its rival Iran. Iran would very likely use the proceeds for purposes that would frustrate Saudi Arabia's strategic interest.In a similar vein, a substantial cut in OPEC output, even if it could be agreed up, would benefit non-OPEC producers and only encourage the expansion of US shale development. Contrary to the some conspiracy theorists who claim Saudi Arabia is doing US bidding by allowing the price of oil to fall to squeeze Russia, it has its own reasons not to want to do Russia favors. Putin's support for Assad in Syria and the Iranian regime puts Russia in opposition to Saudi Arabia. If the Saudis pick up the mantle again as the swing producer, Russia would a beneficiary. A recovery in oil prices would allow Putin to replenish his coffers, which would make its foreign assistance program even more challenging. Moreover, and this is a key point, given OPEC's reduced leverage in the oil market, a large cut in the Middle East production of mostly heavy sour crude might not be sufficient to support prices. It could lead to a loss of both revenue and market share. It could also lead to new widening of the spread between Brent, the international benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark. The significant drop in oil prices over the last several months has not deterred the expansion of US output. In the week ending November 7, the US produced nine mln barrels a day, which was the most in more than two decades. Output slipped in the week through November 14 by less than 60k barrels a day, but we would not read much into that. Industry estimates suggest that more than three-quarters of the new light oil production next year is expected to be profitable between $50 and $69 a barrel.The press reports that rather than be deterred by the decline in prices, some companies, like Encana plan to dramatically increase the number of wells in the US Permian Basin (Texas) next year. Reports do suggest that parts of nearly 20 fields are no longer profitable at $75 a barrel. There has been a very modest reduction of oil rigs. However, this has been largely offset by the rise in productivity of the existing wells. For example, in the North Dakota Bakken area, the output per well has risen to a record. In addition, industry reports suggest that the costs of shale and horizontal drilling is falling. Although the price of oil has fallen below budget levels for many oil producing countries, the situation is not particularly urgent. Seasonally this is a high demand period. Most countries have ample reserves to cover the shortfall in the coming months. Around March, the seasonal factors shift and demand typically eases. That is when some key decisions will have to be made. It may not sound like a significant tell, but when the next OPEC meeting is scheduled may be indicative of a sense of urgency. A meeting in the February-March period may indicate higher anxiety than say a meeting in the middle of next year.  One study by Bloomberg found that only two OPEC quota cuts have been for less than one million barrels. A Bloomberg's survey found that the respondents were evenly split between expecting a cut and not, few seem to be actually anticipating a significant cut. This suggests the scope for disappointment may be limited. That said, there is gap risk on the US oil futures contract come Friday, when they re-open after Thursday's holiday. As a consequence of lower oil prices, some oil producers may have to draw down their financial reserves to close the funding gap. Some will assume this will translate into liquidation of US Treasuries. However, it is not as easy as that. According to US Treasury data, in the first nine months of this year, OPEC increased its holdings of US Treasuries by $41 bln. In some period last year, it had sold about $17 bln of Treasuries. Could OPEC countries also be unwinding the diversification of reserves into euros, with yields so low and officials explicitly seeking devaluation (something not seen in the US since Robert Rubin first articulated a "strong dollar" policy almost two decades ago).  There may be political fallout from a continued decline in oil prices. An agreement between Baghdad and Kurds may be more difficult. Pressure in Libya and Nigeria is bound to increase, for example.  Back in 2009 when some observers began warning that higher food prices were the result of the extremely easy and unorthodox monetary policy. We argued that the shock was more on the supply side than the demand side and that commercial farmers would respond to the price signal by boosting output. Oil is similar but opposite. Oil prices will bottom after producers respond to the price signal by cutting production because they have to, not because they want to. Fear not greed will be the driver. It does not look like this can happen until Brent falls below $70 a barrel and WTI is nearer $60-$65. FREE AppDownload

FLICKR/Graham BallentyneIf a central bank looks like it might be a major buyer of something, should you be a buyer of it too? Of course you should. If we have learnt anything from the last six years it is that buying what the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are buying is the way to make money. They buy, you buy, prices rise. Hold that thought while we look to the Swiss gold referendum on Sunday. The Swiss are partial to referendums. But this one will be of particular interest. Why? Because it’s all about gold… On Sunday, the population of Switzerland will decide whether they want their central bank – the Swiss National Bank (SNB) – to abide by the following rules. It would be prevented from selling any of its gold reserves. It would have to store all those gold reserves actually in Switzerland (at the moment only about 70% is there). And it would have to make sure that at least 20% of its assets are held in gold. Right now less than 8% of the SNB’s assets are held in gold. So raising that to 20% would mean the SNB would have to either sell some of its foreign currency reserves (to increase the proportion of its reserves held on gold), or buy a large amount of gold in pretty short order. It would be highly unlikely to go for the former option, because this would lead the Swiss franc to strengthen, and kick off a nasty deflationary crisis as a result. (One of the reasons that the percentage of the SNB’s assets held in gold has fallen as low as 8% is because Switzerland has been frantically printing francs and using them to buy other currencies in an effort to prevent the franc from rising.) The upshot is that if Switzerland votes ‘yes’, the SNB will buy gold over a five-year period. The gold price is likely to jump as a result – by 18%, suggests the Bank of America. Better still for holders of gold, every time the price of gold fell after that, the SNB would have to buy more to keep their gold reserves at 20%. That would put a partial but permanent floor under the gold price. So again, anyone buying what the central bankers buy will do very nicely indeed. Now, the reality is that the Swiss probably won’t vote ‘yes’. A hardcore of gold bugs likes to think that there will be a ‘shock’ when the votes are counted. But as is often the way with referendums (see Scotland!), the authorities have been out campaigning in the wake of a poll suggesting that a ‘yes’ vote was possible. An aggressive media effort from the SNB seems to have worked in pushing down support for the ‘Save our Swiss Gold’ initiative.  The most recent poll showed 38% in favour, 47% against, and 15% undecided. But the very fact that there has been enough momentum behind the idea to get it this far – and that 38% of the voting population say they will vote ‘yes’ – matters. It’s a reminder that a large part of the populations of countries with money-printing banks aren’t comfortable with the experimental nature of modern monetary policy (which boils down to printing more money every time there is a hint of deflation). The SNB claims that the obligation to hold gold would remove its flexibility to create money as and when it likes (because they’d have to buy more gold whenever they did). But that’s exactly what the Swiss behind the campaign want. They don’t like the fact that central bankers have effectively become more powerful than politicians. And they don’t believe that central bankers are any more capable today than they have been in the past of figuring out exactly how much money should be available in any one economy at any one time. So they want to use the gold initiative to prevent them trying. They aren’t alone in their concerns. If the US had a referendum system similar to that in Switzerland, my bet is that you would see something similar happening there – Republican senator Rand Paul is famously keen on a new gold standard, for example. Those concerns also aren’t likely to go away on the back of a ‘no’ vote. Remember how a mere 38% of the adult population voted ‘yes’ in the Scottish referendum? They haven’t gone away – if anything, they are more angry and more dedicated to their cause than ever (see the Smith Commission report today – which could be viewed as an offer of independence by the back door). The Swiss referendum is just one manifestation of voter dissatisfaction with politics in the developed world. There are more to come, whichever way this vote goes. FREE AppDownload
In the financial world, everyone loves to talk about "potential Black Swan events."  Societe Generale even releases a quarterly chart of "Black Swan" risks.  The concept of a "Black Swan" event takes its name from Nassim Taleb's 2007 book "The Black Swan." But there's a slight problem: acknowledging an event's possibility means it can't be a Black Swan. To wit, SocGen's most recent Swan chart says that further deterioration in the economic situation in Europe poses a risk to the market. And like, objectively, a European economy that performs poorly is bad for the market. But this also isn't a Black Swan. Or, can't be a Black Swan.  A Black Swan is an event or occurrence — a tail event, as Taleb would call it — that is so remote that it is completely unforeseen.  (In fairness, SocGen doesn't call these "potential Black Swans," simply calling this their "Swan Chart," but the "potential" phrase gets thrown around a lot, and a chart with pictures of black swans makes pretty clear what the firm is intimating.) The famous example Taleb uses in his book is the Thanksgiving turkey. "Consider a turkey that is fed every day," Taleb writes. "Every single feeding will firm up the bird's belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race 'looking out for its best interests,' as a politician would say. "On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief." Here's Taleb's famous chart.  Wikimedia Commons This is basically the book's entire message wrapped up in one graphic.  The problem that Taleb is really attacking in his book is forecasting, particularly economic forecasting, and the practice of using past events to predict the future.  Using inductive reasoning to forecast future events poses, for Taleb, not just something potentially useless or wrong, but something that actually has negative value.  "Consider that [the turkey's] feeling of safety reached its maximum when the risk was at the highest!" Taleb writes. "But the problem is even more general than that; it strikes at the nature of empirical knowledge itself. Something has worked in the past, until — well, it unexpectedly no longer does, and what we have learned from the past turns out to be at best irrelevant or false, at worst viciously misleading." And this is really what the problem of Black Swans is all about.  It isn't that we can't know the future, but that we delude ourselves into thinking we can, making forecasts about events that are inherently unforecastable and giving us false belief about what can or will or might happen in the future.  When a Black Swan event really occurs, it will seem outside what had previously seemed possible. But Taleb would likely argue that this event only seems outside previous beliefs about what was possible because of how we arrived at those possibilities.  Namely, by using the past to forecast the future.  Just something to keep in mind as you sit down to enjoy your turkey on Thursday. Or perhaps this will serve as fodder for light conversation with distant relatives this weekend. Either way. FREE AppDownload
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - What should a central bank do next when it already has zero interest rates and arguably still faces the threat of Japanese-style deflation? If it's the Swedish Riksbank, it should keep cutting, and do so soon, says Lars Svensson. Svensson no longer has a say; he quit as a deputy Riksbank governor last year after failing to persuade fellow board members to cut rates aggressively. Last month, they heeded his advice, lowering the repo rate to 0 percent and pushing back the official forecast for when the Riksbank will start tightening monetary policy again to mid-2016. After years of tense, polarized meetings that eventually led to Svensson's resignation, a united Riksbank now sees zero rates as enough to push inflation up toward its 2 percent target. Svensson disagrees, saying Sweden should go into negative rates - effectively charging banks to deposit funds at the central bank - to avoid the deflation which has trapped Japan in low economic growth punctuated by periodic recessions for more than a decade. "From this point it is unlikely that the current policy at zero is enough," he told Reuters. "They should lower to -0.25 or even -0.50. The next meeting would be the natural time." The Riksbank's next policy meeting is on Dec. 15, with its decision announced the following morning. Rate-setters have not ruled out negative rates, but Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves has rejected the comparison with Japan, pointing to expected Swedish growth this year of around 1.9 percent, with the economy moving up a gear again in 2015. Nevertheless, Swedish consumer prices have been flat or falling for most of the last two years on an annual basis. Underlying inflation, the Riksbank's preferred measure which excludes interest rate effects, was 0.6 percent in October. Some fear the bank may have again underestimated how weak price pressures are, especially with economic problems in the euro zone and China, and it needs to do more.. "For Sweden, it all hinges on international demand picking up," said Roger Josefsson, chief economist at Danske Markets. "We are afraid to admit it, but I think there are a lot of similarities between Sweden and Japan." Should inflation fail to rise, the Riksbank's first line of defense will be to push back its mid-2016 forecast for when rates will start going up. The bank could also repeat measures it took in 2008-9 during the global crisis, when it pumped liquidity into the financial system, offering long loans and loans in currencies other than the Swedish crown. It also accepted a wider range of collateral for this funding. Another tool could be adopting the kind of quantitative easing (QE) used by the United States, Japan and Britain - and now being contemplated by the European Central Bank. That could involve printing money to buy up government or mortgage bonds. But with Swedish economic growth and access to credit not a problem, such measures may fail to move inflation much. "Swedish banks are well capitalized and our judgment is that companies and households are getting the loans they require, so we don't see a need there," Riksbank First Deputy Governor Kerstin af Jochnick said in a recent speech. She added that the Riksbank would not achieve much if it bought government debt; yields on 10-year Swedish bonds are already at historic lows at around 1 percent.. Another option would be a currency floor, like that adopted by the Swiss National Bank, to stop the crown appreciating. "If the Riksbank is serious about inflation they have to do something about the currency," said Danske's Josefsson. "QE in Sweden is very difficult because we have very shallow markets." The crown has already eased around 4.5 percent against the euro this year. A further drop would help Swedish exporters, a backbone of the economy but who are struggling with stagnant demand in the euro zone. It would also avoid stoking already worryingly high levels of household debt - the risk of other measures such as QE. But with the relatively strong economy, a large current account surplus and a currency that may be undervalued in a longer term perspective, action on the crown could upset European neighbors. They could accuse Sweden of engineering a devaluation to gain an unfair advantage in export markets. Ingves said recently that intervention to weaken the crown was "not an option currently". Much blame for the low inflation has been laid at the central bank which raised rates in 2010 and 2011 to 2 percent, and kept policy relatively tight even as the global recovery stuttered, fearing easy money could stoke a housing bubble. Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said in the New York Times that the Riksbank had been "awesomely wrongheaded". New European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker wants to kick start EU investment but in Sweden the government has said higher spending will have to be offset by higher taxes. That leaves the Riksbank to fight the Swedish deflation threat alone, and for the moment it is relying on zero rates. "Rate cuts take time before they reach the economy," af Jochnick said. "We should feel the effects of the rate cuts and our judgment is that this will be enough to push up inflation."   (Editing by Alistair Scrutton and David Stamp) FREE AppDownload

London (AFP) - German government bonds leapt Thursday to record peaks on the prospect of quantitative easing in the struggling eurozone, while stocks also pushed higher. The interest rate or yield on Germany's 10-year bond sank to 0.709 percent, below the previous all time-low of 0.719 percent that was hit last month. Bond yields and prices move inversely. The European single currency dropped to $1.2471 from $1.2506 late in New York on Wednesday. "In an environment of plentiful liquidity in the global market, investors are driving down bund yields as investors anticipate further easing by the ECB," said Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital Markets. "Equities are also rallying, aided by rising hopes that a weaker euro will boost earnings and euro area activity." The German 10-year bond -- the Bund -- is the eurozone's key benchmark because Germany benefits from the most confidence among investors. Stocks also rose, with London's FTSE 100 index up 0.06 percent at 6,733.14 points, while the Paris CAC 40 gained 0.16 percent to 4,380.43 points after an earlier technical problem. Frankfurt's benchmark DAX 30 jumped 0.46 percent to 9,960.55 points compared with Wednesday's closing value. Sentiment was somewhat subdued ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see US markets closed Thursday and open for shortened trade on Friday. The European Central Bank's deputy president Vitor Constancio signalled Wednesday it could begin purchasing government bonds -- but not until next year. "The ECB is clearly aiming to drive the euro lower as it attempts to expand its balance sheet, highlighting its accommodating monetary stance -- relative to the US Federal Reserve which is heading towards a normalisation of monetary policy," Stamenkovic added.  Frankfurt stocks were also boosted Thursday because, under a bond-buying plan, the ECB would be required to purchase German bunds in proportion to Germany's near 18-percent contribution to the ECB's capital base. "The DAX is just being pumped up by the prospect of QE," said VTB Capital economist Neil MacKinnon. Constancio's remarks came after ECB chief Mario Draghi recently hinted the bank was ready to act quickly to deter deflation. Neil Mellor, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon, added that there was a "presumption" in markets that the ECB would "stick to higher quality assets" under any bond-buying plan. He added: "And lower bond yields provide valuation support for equities -- along with the presumption of growing surplus liquidity." Elsewhere, oil prices slumped Thursday to four-year lows on growing expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will not take significant action at its output meeting in Vienna. West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January dived to $71.89 a barrel -- the lowest level since September 2010. Brent North Sea crude hit a four-year trough of $75.48 per barrel. Crude prices have tumbled by more than 30 percent since June, depressed also by a strong dollar and worries about stalling energy demand in a weak global economy. On the London Bullion Market, gold slid to $1,196.50 an ounce, compared with $1,197.50 late on Wednesday.   FREE AppDownload

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Sarah FioccoUnfortunately, military activity is good for economic growth too.It's the oldest battle in politics: Whether cutting government spending helps or hurts economic growth. The Financial Times has done everyone a favour by publishing a series of charts on how US government spending contributed, or detracted from, GDP growth. And the conclusion is pretty severe: ... austerity subtracted about 0.76 percentage points off the real growth rate of the economy between the middle of 2010 and the middle of 2011. If real government spending had remained constant at mid-2010 levels and everything else stayed constant, (yes we know these are big assumptions) the US economy would now be about 1.2 per cent larger. There's a secondary conclusion, too: War is good (economically), it turns out. Conservatives say that government needs to get out of the way of the free market because government spending is inherently wasteful — it distorts the market by destroying opportunities for private companies to step in and provide valuable, profitable services based on actual supply and demand. Liberals take the Keynesian line that government spending acts like an economic multiplier: It not only generates immediate economic activity by guaranteeing that money is spent (creating demand), but that spending provides an opportunity for private actors to recycle the money into further investment and further spending. This chart, from the FT's Matthew Klein based on data from the BEA, seems to show that government has a pretty straightforward effect on GDP. When spending goes up, it adds to economic growth. When it goes down, it subtracts from it and hobbles the economy: Financial Times / BEA Klein has another chart isolating the effect of defence spending on growth. Reduced military spending — the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, basically — also hurts growth. The chart shows that as military spending went negative in 2011, it truncated GDP growth. Only recently, as non-defence government spending has outweighed defence cuts, has total government spending been a net contributor to GDP again. Financial Times / BEA The depressing conclusion to all this is that the only thing both left and right can agree on, based on this data, is that foreign wars are good for the economy.

Rob Griffith/ReutersPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin (L) and Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (R) of Saudi Arabia talk through their interpreters during a plenary session at the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane November 15, 2014. Saudi Arabia is risking the economic health of weaker oil producing nations in its fight to see off the threat of the US shale boom. Oil prices have fallen by over 30% since June and appear to be continuing their decline. On Thursday Brent fell to a four-year low of just over $76 a barrel, down from $115 a barrel in June, while US WTI crude dropped to around $72 a barrel. The collapse has taken a heavy toll on states that rely heavily on exports of the commodity to support their economies. Below is a chart from Citi Group of the fiscal break even oil prices (the price at which revenues from oil sales will allow the government to meet its spending commitments) for a selection of oil exporting countries both within and outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). What should be clear is that, although Saudi Arabia's breakeven point has been creeping higher it remains substantially below some of the more vulnerable members. Citi Unfortunately for most of the countries on that list, most forecasters now predict that the days of $100 a barrel oil are now over — at least for now. In a recent note Goldman Sachs estimates that Brent crude will hit $90 again by 2016 with US WTI crude bouncing back up to $80. Goldman Sachs This forecast in large part reflects the huge shale boom that the US is experiencing. The country has seen production increase dramatically over the past couple of years, easily overwhelming cuts from OPEC members over recent years. And yet, the Saudi oil minister has been hinting that OPEC may not agree a cut to production at its key meeting on Thursday. Already this year Venezuela, Nigeria and Russia have burnt through billions of dollars in efforts to support collapsing currencies and flagging economies. Russian international reserves have plummeted by $90 billion since the start of the year spent mostly in foreign exchange markets trying to prop up the rouble. Despite decades of commitments to diversify its economy, oil still accounts for 10% of the country's GDP and around 50% of federal budget revenue. Morgan Stanley estimates that "every $10 fall in the oil price means a $32.4 billion fall in oil and gas exports, which is equivalent to about 1.6% of GDP" and around a $19 billion fall in government budget revenues. Elsewhere Nigeria finally conceded defeat in defending its currency, with the central bank devaluing the naira by 8% and increasing rates sharply on Wednesday. Investors have turned against the currency as Nigeria imports around 80% of the goods it consumers with 95% of its foreign currency earning coming through oil exports. Falling oil prices means the cost of those imports has become a lot steeper. And for Venezuela the situation is simply dire. According to state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela the country looses $700 million for each $1 a barrel decline in oil prices, a cost that the ailing state can ill afford. Adjusted for inflation the country's real GDP remains 2% below its 1970 level and, according to US academics Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, it is now all-but-certain to default on its foreign-currency debt. Iraq and Iran are also vulnerable to sharp price drops. Production in the former at risk due to the threat of Islamic State militants seizing additional territory, including key oil infrastructure. In November forces loyal to the Iraqi government succeeded in forcing IS militants out of the Baiji refinery in northern Iraq, which the had earlier captured. These risks mean the cost of extraction and refining is high. Iran is also vulnerable due to international sanctions imposed over the country's nuclear programme. Last month President Hassan Rouhani announced that Iran's oil revenues had dropped 30% as demand slowed in its major export market, China. Rouhani said that the country would have to "deal with the new conditions and the global economic conditions". TwitterOne theory is that the Saudis are deliberately allowing prices to fall in order to fight off competition from US shale oil and maintain its share of the US market. Undoubtedly, it has come under pressure in what is a major part of the market and keeping prices below $100 a barrel will put pressure on higher cost US shale producers. However, there may be a more fundamental shift going on in the oil market at the moment. The problem for OPEC is that it may no longer be able to control prices (as it has in the past) to avoid these problems. Previously, OPEC members would agree to cut oil production if falling prices posed a threat. That may now have changed because of the shale oil boom in the US, which has dramatically increased supply. As Goldman Sachs wrote in a recent note (emphasis added): [There is a] realisation that the OPEC reaction function has changed and that the US shale barrel is now likely the first swing barrel ... When Saudi Arabia cut prices to Asia for November delivery it was interpreted as a shift in the Saudi reaction function to a focus on market share. This should have not been a surprise in the new world of shale that has flattened the supply curve, as economic game theory suggests that they should not be the first mover and that the US shale barrel should be the new swing barrel given how easily it can be scaled up and down. This may explain Saudi Arabia's unusual hints that it is now comfortable with sub-$90-a-barrel oil prices — it doesn't want to admit that its power to shift the price is drying up. FREE AppDownload
Jeremy Siegel is the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a senior investment strategy advisor to Wisdom Tree Funds. His book, Stocks for the Long Run, now in its fifth edition, is widely recognized as one of the best books on investing. It is available via the link below. He is a regular columnist for Kiplinger’s, a “Market Master” on CNBC and regularly appears on Bloomberg, NPR, CNN and other national and international networks I spoke with Siegel on Monday, November 24th. In our interview on November 29th of last year, you said that investors could expect a 10% to 15% return on the S&amp;P 500 this year. On that day the S&amp;P closed at 1,815 and on Friday it closed at 2,064, which is a 13.7% gain. Congratulations. Another good year. You wonder about how long a streak like that can continue. Well, that’s my first question. What do you consider the fair value of the S&amp;P 500 to be today? I consider the fair value of the S&amp;P 500 to be approximately 2,300. That is not necessarily a forecast for the end of this coming year, but I believe we are in a permanently lower interest rate environment, which supports higher than historical valuations for equities. I still believe P/E expansion is in the cards. An 18 to 20 P/E ratio is appropriate given what Bill Gross dubbed the “new neutral” interest rates that we are likely to see in the coming decade. What would cause you to be more bearish? Of course there are always isolated bearish events – terrorist attacks, pandemics, things like that. What we saw with Ebola a little more than a month ago is representative of them. But as far as structurally bearish events, I worry about a tightening of the labor force that brings about an inflationary rise in wages, meaning that we cannot continue at the 200,000 weekly pace in the non-farm payrolls that we’ve had. We are not adding to the labor supply enough to absorb it. We are not even increasing the labor force enough to offset the increase in the payrolls, and that is why the unemployment rate is going down so rapidly.   Ultimately, we are going to come across a constraint where the demand for labor exceeds the supply, putting inflationary pressures on wages, forcing the Fed to tighten more than I anticipate at the current time. One of the big disappointments that we have seen in the U.S. is productivity growth. It plunged in the first quarter of this year. GDP growth was way, way down that quarter, but it didn’t snap back in the second and third quarters to anything that is exciting. It’s disappointing in this internet-connected world where there are so many laborsaving devices that we haven’t sparked productivity increases. Some economists claim there is always a lag between the introduction of new technologies and actual productivity growth. That is one of the reasons why GDP growth has been so disappointing in the face of technology advances. Even though we have had good labor-market growth since the financial crisis, we haven’t been able to get the normal boost in productivity that would get us to the 3% or 4% GDP growth that we experienced during most of the postwar period. The key variable to watch is the labor participation rate, which unfortunately has been declining. It is a very disappointing response to the excellent employment growth and decline in unemployment. So one risk is that we will hit a constraint that will cause the Fed to tighten prematurely I am not too concerned about Europe, China or Japan. They are going to get through their slow growth. China is on a lower growth path than it was before the financial crisis, but 6% to 7% growth a year is still extremely good. As far as Japan is concerned, Shinzo Abe has to make some progress with the “third arrow” of his tri-part economic plan, which, besides monetary easing, includes labor-market and other structural reforms. I don’t think monetary expansion alone can spark prosperity for the Japanese economy. On the European front, I believe that Draghi will move to take down the euro even more. My interim forecast is $1.15 for the euro, and if there is no economic pickup at that level, perhaps even lower. He may engage in quantitative easing, but lowering the price of the euro would be probably more effective. Demographic factors in Europe and Japan are working against economic growth. Labor-market rigidities are somewhat related to the aging of the workforce, because people who have the jobs – the older generation – don’t want to lose them and yet they want all their benefits. Where does the U.S. stand with respect to those types of structural reforms? It’s not easy to get structural reform. The US and Europe need to put their entitlement programs on a long-term solvent basis. These entitlement programs are going to dog the developed countries in the world in coming decades. Nevertheless, there is no deficit problem in the US over the next five years. The long-term problems with entitlements don’t really kick in until about 10 years from now, so we are not going to need imminent reform on those programs. The big question that faces us in the United States is whether we need a crisis to get reform. I would hope not, but given the political stalemate, that might happen. Nevertheless there is no fiscal crisis that I foresee over the next five years. Last year you predicted a 3.5% annual GDP growth for this year, which is above where we are year-to-date. My forecast was too optimistic. We only have had 2% GDP growth in the first three quarters. Part of that, of course, was that terrible first quarter, which was weather-related to some degree. We are really running below-trend GDP. I, the Fed and almost all forecasters were too optimistic on the GDP side. And yet we were too pessimistic on the unemployment side. The reason for that was the productivity growth being so disappointing as I remarked earlier. The early read for this fourth-quarter is not great. Most estimates that I see are between 2% and 2.5%. I am hoping that the drop in oil prices, which is a very significant economic event, could boost growth this quarter and through 2015. But we will have to wait to see how the GDP data come out on that. This article originally appeared at Advisor Perspectives.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload

Chinese banks, which are heavily controlled by the government, are often instructed to match their lending practice to further official policy, and when the People's Bank of China cut rates for the first time in two years on Friday, it made clear that helping smaller firms gain access to credit was among its goals. Outstanding yuan loan growth slipped to its slowest in almost nine years in October, and the PBOC's efforts might well succeed in raising the headline figures, but bankers say it is commonplace to game the statistics to hit targets. One trick is to extend a loan but then ask the borrower to use a portion of the fund to purchase wealth-management products sold by the bank, helping to hit both loan goals and sales targets. Another technique is to require a portion of the money lent - anywhere between 30 and 40 percent, according to bankers - returned as deposits, so it can earn interest on the whole loan, while effectively retaining part of it. "It's just internally generated business through a dummy counterpart," said Jimmy Leung, banking and capital markets leader and partner at PwC China. The banking regulator has said these practices are illegal but say only "some commercial banks" engage in them. Bankers say manipulation is still rampant. "It's very common," said a banker at a major state-owned bank who declined to be identified.   STEP-UP IN POLICING As the world's second-biggest economy heads for its slowest yearly growth in 15 years, authorities have been stepping up efforts to reduce the cost of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, which included instructions from China's cabinet to "prevent the illegal diversion of loans and ensure that loan funds flow directly to the real economy". In early September, the China Banking Regulatory Commission posted a notice asking banks not to "use underhand measures to illegally attract and falsely increase deposits". But bankers say the efforts are slow and ineffective and have done little to curb the practices. Another banker said agreements to return some of the loan as deposits have now become verbal, as opposed to being written into loan documents previously. "The CBRC is feeling the stones to cross the river ... but bankers have already reached the other side," he said.   (Additional reporting by Kazunori Takada and Jake Spring; Editing by Will Waterman) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Denis Charlet/Pool French President Francois Hollande.France's major stock index, the CAC 40, just came back online after three and a half hours out of action due to a technical issue. Trading went on as normal, according to Euronext, which runs the index. They say that the "investigation regarding the calculation and dissemination of all Euronext  indices and INAVs (indicative net asset values) is ongoing". This isn't quite like the NASDAQ glitch last year, which halted activity entirely. Everything seems to be going on correctly behind the scenes, but the index didn't display anything for hours, putting some investors a little one edge. These glitches used to be more common, due to issues like squirrels chewing through the wrong wires. Whatever the fault is, it also stopped indices in the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal opening too, according to Bloomberg. The CAC 40 just opened up +0.09% after three and a half hours down.  There's one good thing to come out of this: we now know that a technical glitch is "un bug technique" in French. FREE AppDownload
Visa has become the latest World Cup sponsor to publicly criticize football's governing body FIFA for its handling of the investigation into alleged corruption over the bidding process that will see Russia holding the 2018 tournament and the 2022 competition being held in Qatar. Marketing Week reports that Visa  — which has a contract with FIFA to sponsor the World Cup until 2022, at an estimated value of £120 million over a four-year tournament-long period, according to sponsorship agency BrandRapport — is calling for more "forthright communications" from FIFA. Visa released this statement on its corporate Tumblr page: FIFA has an ever-growing crisis on its hands: it needs to hold on to the support of its sponsors as they account for 40% its commercial revenue, according to its latest financial filings. But that support is waning, at least as far as corporate communications are concerned. Visa's statement comes in the same week Coca-Cola said the handling of FIFA's botched investigation into the bidding process has been "disappointing." It adds to the growing negative tenor between sponsors and FIFA — other sponsors including Adidas, Hyundai, Sony and Budweiser have all previously released statements criticizing FIFA and the media storm it has created surrounding the World Cup bidding process — and brands are looking to distance themselves from the scandals. A report in the Wall Street Journal this week suggested that Sony is close to terminating its contract with FIFA altogether, partly due to the controversy surrounding FIFA's investigation. The contract is up for renewal this year. Earlier this month Emirates announced it was ending its sponsorship of the World Cup after an eight-year partnership with FIFA, "following an evaluation of FIFA's contract proposal which did not meet Emirates' expectations." Most people took that to read that Emirates was uneasy about the corruption claims surrounding the bid process for the World Cup, particularly the 2022 tournament held in Qatar. However, the decision may also have been made because the brand is in a far more prominent place than it was back in 2006, and the brand awareness opportunity a World Cup can offer is no longer necessary. Emirates' contract also came to an end in 2014 anyway. Sponsors have become increasingly perturbed with FIFA after the governing body released a summary of report on its investigation into the World Cup bidding process, cleaning the winning Qatar and Russia bids of any corruption. Shortly after its publication, the summary was disowned by FIFA's own ethics chief Michael Garcia, who said the report had been "misrepresented." FIFA announced last week it was lodging a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general regarding "possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups." The Mail on Sunday reports that five officials with connections to FIFA are at the center of the investigation. But FIFA's ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert said there was not enough evidence to question the entire bidding process.  Awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been controversial decision. Qatar said earlier this month it will not be able to keep its promise to hold the 2022 World Cup in the summer — completely disrupting European football seasons and potentially clashing with the Winter Olympics — its original $200 billion construction proposal has already seen 12 stadiums cut to eight, and the country's football body is continually fending off accusations of poor workers' conditions and a mounting death toll, which at the last report stood at around 900. But despite the growing furore FIFA is facing at the moment, most sponsorship experts that Business Insider has spoken to don't think a widespread boycott is likely. The World Cup is an unrivaled marketing opportunity in terms of scale and, if a sponsor were to pull out, one of their rivals would be all-too-glad to step in. Statement's like Visa's appear to be an attempt at brand damage limitation. FREE AppDownload
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek labor unions staged a 24-hour strike on Thursday that canceled hundreds of flights, shut public offices and severely disrupted local transport, in the first major industrial action to cripple the austerity-weary country in months. Private sector union GSEE and its public sector counterpart ADEDY called the walkout to protest against planned layoffs and pension reform demanded by European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders who have bailed out Greece twice. All Greek domestic and international flights were canceled after air traffic controllers joined the strike. Trains and ferries also halted services. Hospitals worked on emergency staff while tax and other local public offices remained shut. "GSEE is resisting the dogmatic obsession of the government and the troika with austerity policies and tax hikes," the union said in a statement this week. It accused the government of trying to take the labor market back to "medieval times" and of implementing policies that are causing a "humanitarian crisis". Thousands of Greeks were preparing to march to parliament later on Thursday as part of rallies to mark the strike. The two unions last held a general strike in April. Major protests have declined sharply since then as frustration and anger give way to a mood of despondency and resignation over a jobless rate exceeding 25 percent and a sharp fall in incomes. Turnout at Thursday's rallies could provide a key measure of the opposition facing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's conservative-led government, which is under pressure from EU/IMF lenders to impose more cutbacks to balance next year's budget. Samaras has imposed repeated rounds of austerity to ensure Greece continues to receive aid payments but is now trying to abandon the unpopular bailout program in a bid to secure his government's survival through next year. In a setback to those plans, Greek officials returned empty-handed from Paris on Wednesday after two days of talks with EU/IMF inspectors failed to clinch a deal on the country's final bailout review.   (Writing by Deepa Babington; Editing by Gareth Jones) FREE AppDownload
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker easily survived a confidence vote in the European Parliament on Thursday brought over revelations that Luxembourg attracted multinationals with super low tax rates during his period as prime minister. The censure motion was clearly defeated by 461 votes to 101, but it is hardly an auspicious start for Juncker, who has faced criticism in his first month in office, both over his former role as Luxembourg leader and the potential conflict of interest as head of a European Commission examining tax avoidance. The motion of censure, brought by far-right parties such as France's Front National and anti-EU parties including Britain's UKIP, said that Juncker was directly responsible for Luxembourg's tax avoidance policies during his time as the country's prime minister.   (Reporting By Philip Blenkinsop) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersBritain's Prime Minister Cameron delivers a speech at a UK Investment Summit in Newport, south WalesLONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a blow to his re-election campaign on Thursday after his pledge to cut migration to the tens of thousands was undercut by new data showing a net 260,000 people moved to Britain in the year to June. The data, which showed net migration was up more than 40 percent on the previous 12 months, is awkward for Cameron who is under pressure from the rise in popularity of the UK Independence Party, which wants to strongly curb the number of people coming to Britain. Immigration has shot to the top of voter concerns before a 2015 national election and Cameron has promised to reduce net migration to "tens of thousands" before the May vote, a pledge a senior minister in his Conservative party last week said the government was now unlikely to meet. The British leader is due to set out before Christmas new plans to limit EU migration, which Thursday's figures showed rose by 45,000 on the previous year. "Where you have uncontrolled migration, where migration is at very high levels, it has those impacts on public services, on housing, on hospitals," Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the BBC. "So it is absolutely right that we continue to focus on this issue."   (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan and William James; Editing by Andrew Osborn) FREE AppDownload
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will tell France, Italy and Belgium on Friday that their 2015 budgets risk breaking EU rules, but it but will defer decisions on any action until early March. Draft documents seen by Reuters show the three countries are part of a group also comprising Spain, Portugal, Austria, and Malta at risk of busting budget limits. The Commission urges all of the countries not to break their budgets, but picks out Rome, Paris and Brussels for a second review of compliance in March. This gives the three more time to adjust policy before the EU executive must decide whether to fine France for missing consolidation targets or put Italy and Belgium under a disciplinary procedure because of their debt. "Overall, the Commission is of the opinion that the Draft Budgetary Plan of France, which is currently under the corrective arm, is at risk of non-compliance with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact," a draft document, seen by Reuters, said. "The Commission will examine in early March 2015 its position vis-à-vis France's obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact in the light of the finalization of the budget law and of the expected specification of the structural reform program announced by the authorities," it said. The wording for Italy and Belgium is the same. The Commission will publish the assessments of all of the draft budgets of the 18 euro zone countries, except Greece and Cyprus which remain under bailout programs, on Friday. The assessments are a new power the EU executive arm got last year in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, to make sure governments did not ignore EU rules that set limits on the size of public debt and deficit.   (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA worker wearing protective glasses welds steel products at a heavy equipment manufacturing factory in LuoyangBEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector likely slowed slightly in November as demand remained sluggish, a Reuters poll showed. The median forecast from 12 economists in the poll was that the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for November will be 50.6, slightly lower than October's 50.8. The survey will be released on Monday. A reading above 50-point level indicates an expansion in activity while one below that points to a contraction on a monthly basis. If the survey shows a slower pace of expansion in November, that may keep investors worried that the Chinese economy, which has stumbled this year, may not recover soon. Industrial Bank Co. Ltd, in a research note, said consumption only showed good signs at an online "singles' day" promotion by Alibaba Group Holding on Nov. 11 and steel production fell nearly 10 percent this month as mills near Beijing halted operations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Hurt by unsteady exports, a housing downturn and cooling investment growth, the Chinese economy is in danger of missing the government's growth target of about 7.5 percent this year. Third-quarter growth of 7.3 percent was the weakest since the global financial crisis. China cut interest rates unexpectedly on Nov. 21, stepping up efforts to support the world's second-biggest economy as it heads towards its slowest expansion in nearly a quarter of a century, saddled under a mountain of debt. "I don't think the interest rate cut will have a huge impact on the real economy. The biggest problems are still weak demand and tight credit," said Zhou Hao, ANZ economist in Shanghai. A preliminary PMI survey released last week by HSBC/Markit showed the manufacturing sector stalled in November, with output contracting for the first time in six months. The official PMI is focused on larger, state-owned factories, as opposed to the HSBC/Markit PMI which focuses more on smaller manufacturers in the private sector.

Oil prices fell on Thursday ahead of a major meeting of OPEC members to decide on whether to cut production in the face of sharp price falls in the commodity over recent months. Bloomberg The latest falls are being attributed to growing doubts over the cartel's willingness to cut production after Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest member, appeared to cool expectations on Wednesday. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said he expected the oil market "to stabilise itself eventually" strongly indicating that the kingdom may be willing to accept a longer period of lower oil prices in order to protect its market share against the US shale boom. EIAOil prices have fallen by some 34% since June on the back of huge additional supply from the US shale boom as well as record output from Russia and surprisingly strong production in the troubled regions of Iraq and Libya. However, a number of OPEC members are less sanguine about the recent falls. In particular Venezuela, Iraq and Iran have all called for production cuts to support prices as the falls hurt their fragile domestic economies. The Iraqi oil minister reportedly said on Thursday that there was a price floor at around $65-$70 a barrel. Outside of OPEC Russia and Nigeria have also been agitating for a cut, with lower oil revenues taking their toll on national budgets. It's estimated that Russia needs oil to hold up at around $105 a barrel next year if it is to meet its current government spending commitments, while Nigeria and Venezuela require $122.7 and $117.5 respectively. Deutsche Bank, Business Insider A meeting between Saudi Arabia,  Venezuela and non-OPEC oil producers Russia and Mexico on Tuesday failed to result in any agreement to cut production levels. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez said that current prices were "not good" for producer countries, but that the only conclusion reached was for all sides to meet again in three months. It now looks increasingly likely that those agitating for sharp cuts are going to have to accept more pain in the short term. However, for some more vulnerable countries further price falls even in the short term could be disastrous.  FREE AppDownload

Shanghai's stock exchange is booming again, but for how long? Bloomberg is taking a pretty dim view of the sudden upswing for mainland China's biggest financial centre. The Shanghai stock exchange composite index was down for the year to date, until September. It's now surging upwards, with a 1% climb today, leaving it an astonishing 28.45% ahead of its January open. It's left the S&amp;P 500 (up a mere 14.26%) in the dust.  The index is now back to a three-year high. It's some way off a record levels, having peaked at over 6,000 before the global financial crisis hit a few years ago. Here's a chart to put that in perspective: Bank of America But the average value of shares traded is back above ¥200 billion ($32.58 billion, £20.63 billion) per day, according to Bloomberg, causing some fears for a correction.  “It’s a good chance we’re at a market top right now,” David Cui, the China strategist at Bank of America, who’s ranked No. 1 by Institutional Investor magazine, said by phone yesterday. “Based on the experience since the global financial crisis, surging volumes each time marked a temporary top for the market.” Jumps in trading may signal market peaks because they reflect too much investor “euphoria” toward stocks, according to Cui. There are endless indications that China's economy is slowing even as Shanghai's equities boom picks up. Growth has fallen from the double-digit levels that were common before the financial crisis, but not everyone is pessimistic. From Bloomberg again:  “There will still be more leeway to go for the market because the overall monetary policy has slightly changed to support growth,” said Kelvin Wong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., which has about $296 billion under management. “At least for the near term, the market should continue to edge up.” FREE AppDownload

These days, investors can’t help but write big checks to fund startups that have a shot at changing the world. To borrow some perspectivefrom venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, “it can … be irresponsible to NOT invest to become #1 in a big new market.” And so the tech press occasionally issues articles about startups with head-shakingly high valuations following extra-large funding rounds. The latest came yesterday, when a report suggested that a forthcoming funding round for Uber would value the startup at $35 billion to $40 billion. If the report is true, Uber would be much closer to a recent valuation for Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi and potentially even farther ahead of other hot companies that remain privately held, including Square, Pinterest, Cloudera, Palantir, and Spotify. Companies rarely discuss valuations in public, so it’s difficult to provide definitive information. Still, the recent reports show which companies have some major potential. venturebeat.com This article originally appeared at VentureBeat.  Copyright 2014. Follow VentureBeat on Twitter.

TOKYO - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would recall 57,000 vehicles globally to replace potentially deadly air bags made by Takata Corp, in a sign that the safety crisis surrounding the Japanese auto parts maker is far from contained. Toyota's action follows a recall by rival Honda Motor Co for the same problem two weeks ago after revelations of a fifth death, in Malaysia, caused by Takata's air bag inflator. More than 16 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata's air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal fragments inside the car. Subject to Toyota's latest recall are the Vitz subcompact, called the Yaris in some markets, as well as RAV4 crossovers made between December 2002 and March 2004. About 40,000 of those are in Japan, with Europe accounting for about 6,000. The recall does not cover North America, Toyota said. Toyota said it was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the recalled vehicles. Separately, Toyota's small-car unit Daihatsu Motor Co filed a recall of 27,571 Mira models in Japan for the same problem, marking its first Takata air bag-related recall, a Japanese transport ministry official said. Takata-related recalls are almost certain to balloon after U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday ordered the company to expand its regional recall of driver-side air bags to cover the entire United States instead of only hot and humid areas. Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.   (Reporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Mari Saito; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) FREE AppDownload
When OPEC leaders convene in Vienna Thursday, the recent sharp decline in the oil price will top the agenda. Yet despite the pressures, our research suggests that the underlying economics of production should eventually drive the oil price higher from current levels. Since the end of August, the price of Brent crude has fallen by more than 20% to about US$80 a barrel. It comes after three relatively stable years during which the price stayed within the US$90–110 per barrel range. Several factors have triggered the decline. Demand growth has slowed, particularly in emerging markets and the euro area. Non-OPEC production growth has stayed strong, driven by the US shale revolution. And OPEC production has also increased as Libyan facilities have started coming back online. Meanwhile, there’s growing concern that Saudi Arabia is rethinking its commitment to play a balancing role in world markets. Oil Price = Production Cost + Security Premium  But what really drives the oil price? In our view, oil prices are underpinned by the full cost of new production plus a security premium. This premium is influenced by the availability of spare capacity to meet potential supply disruptions (like the recent civil war in Libya or sanctions on Iran). Oil demand grows slowly by about 1%–1.5% a year. That may not sound like a lot, but meeting this demand growth for about 0.9 million to 1.2 million barrels per day (bbl/d) is no easy task. Unlike most commodities, oil needs intense investment just to keep production flat, because producing fields decline by about 6% a year (or 5.5 million bbl/d). So the world needs new projects to deliver about 6.5–7 million bbl/d of new supply—just to preserve current spare capacity (Display).AllianceBernsteinAdditional supply from US shale will help meet some of that demand growth. But we believe new investments in ultra-deep water and oil sands are still needed. According to our analysis, some of these projects require oil prices of at least US$80–90 to be economical. Gauging Spare Capacity  Spare capacity matters for these calculations. Saudi Arabia controls most of the industry’s spare capacity, which amounts to about three million bbl/d, according to our estimates. That’s not really a lot considering that troubles in a major producer such as Libya, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria or Venezuela could curtail supply by more than one million bbl/d. It also feeds into the security premium. Consumers are anxious to sustain smooth oil supplies no matter what, and will tend to pay to secure it when capacity is tight—or when there’s a perceived threat to supply. This explains why the oil price spiked in June as ISIS drove on Baghdad. On average we believe the security premium adds about US$10 to prices. Taken together, all of these factors suggest an equilibrium oil price of US$90–100, according to our analysis. Of course in the short term, if production rises faster than demand, a glut of oil can push prices below this range. But if low prices persist, investment will be suppressed and spare capacity will tighten (Display). Then, prices are likely to begin rising againAllianceBernstein The Saudi Question Short-term swings in demand and the phasing of new supply additions can cause the price to fluctuate. But in recent years, Saudi Arabia has adjusted production to keep the market balanced and prices fairly stable. Saudi officials recently suggested that they might no longer be willing to cut supply to balance weaker demand and US supply growth. This may be a negotiating stance ahead of the big OPEC meeting on November 27—or it could reflect a desire to reduce investment by non-OPEC producers. If OPEC moves to curtail production in the coming months, Brent prices could rise back into the US$90 range fairly quickly. Alternatively, a Saudi tactical shift could keep prices lower for longer. But not forever. If US$80 oil is sustained for a year or more, we think the impact on investment will be significant and the seeds of a future spike in oil prices will have been sown. In our view, it’s only a matter of time before the market begins to recognize this—and starts to push up oil prices again. This blog was originally published in InstitutionalInvestor.com.

It was big news when the public found out that Silicon Valley interns make about twice as much as the average San Franciscan ($6,000/month vs. $3,000/month). It turns out that we may have missed a few sizable bonuses that salary site Glassdoor didn’t take into account. This week, a young Bay Area resident, Tiffany Zhong, tweeted a list of top offers made to interns at the major tech companies, compiled by a source close to her. Zhong’s tweet put these salaries in the news again, showing that top paid interns make a lot more money than most of the country. What’s interesting about the list isn’t the base salary but the perks: $1,500/month for housing, a free laptop, and spending stipends. venturebeat.com But the recent reports reposting Zhong’s salary list may have buried the lede. We always knew Silicon Valley interns earned more than the average intern, but we failed to take into account some of very expensive extras. So we have to revise our estimates. The base monthly salaries are right in line with what Glassdoor has estimated for years. But with the added bonuses, it’s clear that interns are earning more than those estimates. Here’s a revised chart (below) based on the estimated perks from Zhong’s numbers. I’ve included the top three tech companies for which Glassdoor has reliable and publicly available data. Whether or not you think this is unfair, you or a loved one may want to get in on some of the Silicon Valley gold. We hear that software training boot camps work for getting a job. venturebeat.com FREE AppDownload
VIENNA — Just hours after nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers missed a Monday deadline, yielding instead a seven-month extension of negotiations, one sign indicated a combative return to business as usual. In a speech to visiting Muslim clerics, Iran’s supreme religious leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, devoted just two lines to the talks: “In the nuclear issue, America and colonial European countries got together and did their best to bring the Islamic Republic to its knees, but they could not do so – and they will not be able to do so.” A triumphalist note, perhaps, about the 2-1/2 years of talks between Iran and the so-called P5+1 group (the US, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany), and one that may sound jarring to those in the West who worry that extending the talks makes them vulnerable to hard-liners on both sides who oppose a compromise deal. But, analysts say, it is in fact part of an effort to broaden Iranian official and public support for continuing the talks and prepare Iranians for the result, whatever it may be. Throughout the process, Mr. Khamenei has authorized every negotiating step, and in recent months – as the talks closed in on the Nov. 24 deadline – increasingly engaged in laying down Iran’s “red line” positions and gave personal support to Iran’s diplomats. In the past week there have been further signs of Khamenei lining up support for a deal: an orchestrated nationwide push from Friday prayer leaders and even senior military officers – voices that have often been critical of negotiations – to support the talks and a possible compromise with foreign powers led by a long-standing arch-enemy, the United States. “You can look at it both ways: They are preparing the ground either for a deal, or a situation where a deal doesn’t happen, because there are so many differences,” says Farideh Farhi, an Iran specialist at the University of Hawaii. “It makes perfect sense for the Iranian political establishment to enter this process in a unified way so win or lose, failure or success, everyone can take credit…. They have decided they are all in this together,” says Ms. Farhi. “It’s not a delaying tactic; their logic is close to that of the P5+1,” adds Farhi. As the deadline approached, and gaps remained, the Iranians could have walked away, but instead, like the P5+1 diplomats, “looked each other in the eye and decided, ‘no.’ ” Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France – which has taken the toughest line against Iran of the P5+1– said in the final days talks had “accelerated” and that he detected from Iran “a will to find an agreement I hadn’t felt in the past.”  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, immediately after announcement of the extension to June 30, 2015, sought to put a positive spin on the arrangement, which both keeps Iran’s nuclear program frozen and the bulk of crippling sanctions in place. “Nobody doubts in the world today that Iran must have a nuclear activity, and that sanctions should be removed.… Our nation has been victorious this time,” Mr. Rouhani told Iranian state TV in Tehran. “Our logic is that of negotiation and interaction with the world,” said Rouhani. A deal would come “sooner or later,” he said, and predicted improvement “from gray to twilight and bright of day.” US officials took Rouhani’s words as a sign of Khamenei’s continued blessing for the talks. Beyond the nuclear issue, some Iranian analysts suggest that more than a year of intense US-Iran diplomatic interaction – the first such contact since Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution – may yield a shift away from Iran’s strident official anti-Americanism to a more functional relationship. Nobody is using the word “friendship,” after 35 years of mutual hostility and overt and covert conflict between the US and Iran. But practical change may be afoot with a common enemy in Sunni militants of the Islamic State and a common desire for regional stability. Resolving the nuclear issue “is an accelerator on every US-Iran issue,” says Amir Mohebian, a conservative analyst with close ties to power centers in Iran. “You can see the negotiations are not between P5+1, but the US and Iran. This can unfreeze the space between the US and Iran, but very gradually.”  President Barack Obama’s fourth and most recent letter to Khamenei, in which he addressed the nuclear talks and the spread of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, had a “good” tone and positive impact in Tehran, says Mr. Mohebian. Speaking over the weekend, Mr. Obama hinted at a broader result if a nuclear accord can be reached.  “What a deal would do is take a big piece of business off the table and perhaps begin a long process in which the relationship not just between Iran and us but the relationship between Iran and the world, and the region, begins to change,” Obama told ABC in an interview broadcast Sunday. Still, Khamenei has rarely wavered from tough anti-US rhetoric. In speeches he often lists historical grievances – from the CIA’s role in a 1953 coup in Iran to the Stuxnet computer virus aimed at disrupting Iran’s nuclear program – that he says mean the US can’t be trusted. Washington has a similar list, just as long. But Khamenei has also authorized direct contact with the US if he thought it served Iran’s interests, as in providing the US targeting and intelligence information on the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. Khamenei could present a nuclear deal to Iranians this way, says Mohebian: “This is the result of your independence and resistance. Your enemy respects you. And – universally for all people – when someone respects you, they are not your enemy.”  Already, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who led Iran's team at the negotiations in Vienna, said the talks had resulted in a “defeat of Iranophobia” in the world, and a chipping a way of “compounded mistrust” between Iran, the US, and the West. There was criticism of Rouhani on Tuesday in hard-line media and among conservatives in parliament, though the reformist Shargh daily said Iran’s diplomatic dialogue with the West and particularly the US was a “major change” that amounted to a “victory of realism, rationality, and pragmatism." The reformist Etemaad newspaper said the coordinated support for nuclear talks among all Friday prayer leaders – their messages are synchronized with the supreme leader’s office – was “unprecedented.” Maj. Gen. Hassan Firouzabadi, the armed forces chief of staff, said talks had been “progressing in the right manner.” Likewise, the hard-line commander of Iran’s ideological Basij militia, Brig. Gen. Mohammad-Reza Naghdi, has said the talks “so far maintained our dignity.”  Still, hard-line doubt persists, despite the moderating tone of recent days. While a nuclear deal might shift official Iranian attitudes toward the US, the faithful still chant “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” every week at Friday prayers. This week, those chants echoed in parliament in Tehran, too. “Many people say this anti-Americanism is part of the identity of the revolution, so it is a very big change. How can [the revolution] survive, how can it reach agreement [on the nuclear issue] but also keep this identity?” says a veteran observer in Tehran who asked not to be named. “Still Khamenei says, ‘We can’t trust America,’ ” notes the observer, ironically. “So let’s sit for hours and days and months and try like hell for a deal with these people we can’t trust.” FREE AppDownload
WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney keeps showing up at the top of Republican presidential polls. The latest boost to the draft-Mitt movement comes from a Quinnipiac survey that has the 2012 GOP presidential candidate in the lead for the 2016 nomination. He’s the choice of 19 percent of Republican voters,according to Quinnipiac. Ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is second in this survey, with 11 percent. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired surgeon and political neophyte Ben Carson tied for the bronze medal at 8 percent. “Remember Mitt? Republicans still have Governor Mitt Romney on top of mind and top of the heap in the potential race for the top job,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, in a statement. Yes, Mr. Malloy, we do remember Mitt. And Mitt remembers what running for president (and losing) is like. That’s one reason he is not going to do it again. He says he won’t. His wife, Ann, says he won’t. We’ll take them at their word until there’s hard evidence otherwise, and by “hard evidence” we mean a big campaign sign erected on one of his front lawns. That said, the results here do spark some holiday eve musings. Is Jeb Bush in trouble? If early polls are a reflection of how famous potential candidates are, shouldn’t Mr. Bush be doing a little better? Maybe he’s not well positioned to start as the GOP establishment choice in the primaries, after all. Yes, Jeb finishes first when the Quinnipiac people poll without Mr. Romney in the mix, but only at 14 percent. That’s too close to Governor Christie for comfort. Ben Carson! Dr. Carson is extremely unlikely to be the GOP nominee for president. The last nonpolitician to win a party nod was Dwight Eisenhower, who’d recently helped win World War II. But 8 percent as somebody who’s starting as an unknown? He’s got some organizing going on somewhere already. Either that or his book tours have made him more famous than we realized. Hillary Clinton is not invincible. As we said last week, Hillary Rodham Clinton is a historically strong candidate for the Democratic nomination. But that’s not the same thing as being unbeatable in November 2016. She’s ahead of most GOP candidates by a comfortable margin, but not a huge one. And the Quinnipiac survey has her losing a head-to-head to ... you guessed it, Romney. He takes that one 45 to 44 percent. OK, technically that is a tie, given the poll margin of error. But, hmm ... maybe we’ll need to readjust our 99.9999 (repeating) percent odds against his throwing his wallet into the 2016 ring. FREE AppDownload
No figure in the hospitality industry mystifies me more than the hotel concierge. They have to know everything and anything, do anything and everything and keep perfectly pleasant and positive even when requests are totally absurd. I connected with Wonder Woman concierge Isabelle Hogan, head concierge at The Mark Hotel, a five-star dig on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, to learn a little bit more about what she and other concierges do exactly and how they do it. Her background: She’s been making helicopters and perfect amenities appear for guests since she started as a concierge in 1998, first working at New York City’s The Plaza, The Carlyle and the former Mandarin Oriental (now The Mark Hotel). I’ll let her tell it how it is, though unfortunately what doesn’t come across below is that she has the best French accent ever. In a nutshell? To me the concierge is the ambassador of the hotel. If the guest doesn’t have a good experience with the concierge the whole trip will be a mess. It’s a balancing act: reservations, tickets, keeping baths warm and bubbly. A typical day is non-stop. You have to be ready for any question at any moment, because any guest can ask you anything. And I love that they ask you all different questions. You come to work and you never know what’s going to happen that day. It’s just one thing after another: restaurant reservations, theater tickets, travel arrangements, sending someone to pick up shopping at Bergdorf or getting them a car. Someone might call and say, ‘I’m coming tomorrow and want the whole room set up with champagne and rose petals and make me a bath and it has to be warm when we arrive,’ and you don’t even know when they’re going to come. So you have to keep running from the desk to the room and make sure the bath is still warm and has bubbles, so you’re adding warm water and bubbles… You’re just always in action. There’s really no limit to their scope of work, which can include 8-hour shopping sprees with Saudi princesses. One of my guests was 16 years old and her dad had given her $100,000 cash to go shopping. Because I had lived in Saudi Arabia myself and I was a woman the father asked me if I could go shopping with her for the day. So, we were in a stretch limo with her assistant who had the $100,000 cash in a briefcase. I remember, I was six months pregnant and we went from one store to the other and she was buying the same thing in different colors. We spent eight hours shopping. They’re inhumanly optimistic and relentless. Even if we know we can’t do it we never tell a customer no or that we can’t do it. It’s, ‘Mr. Smith, let me check on it to see if we can make it happen.’ And if not we will find an alternative. That’s my philosophy of being a concierge. I tell my concierges we have to make it happen, whatever way things go. Rule #1 is to never give up until you get a yes. Today if I call a restaurant and say I wanted a reservation for five at 7 pm one will say no, so I call back 10 minutes later and that other person who isn’t in a bad mood will say yes. And if not you go to the general manager I will just talk to that person, tell them where I’m calling from and that if they want my business… and they say ‘OK, fine, great.’ Their network is enviable. Stores and restaurants always want us to send them their business, so they come to us and talk to us about their businesses and invite us there. That’s how we make all our connections. You want an unlocked iPhone 6 in a few hours? Isabelle did just that for a guest the other week. I have connections at the Apple store and an electronics store, and fortunately I was able to get one. The job does have some jealousy-inducing perks.  All of the big-name restaurants invite us first and want us to go try. It’s a great perk to go—I don’t understand how I’m not 300 pounds by now. I go to try the restaurants and base my recommendations off myself and my experience. A lot of designers, Broadway shows and spas will invite us out, too, and we decide which ones we think are worth recommending. But they take their recommendations seriously. A complimentary invite doesn’t equal an automatic recommendation. Sometimes I don’t like to go [to a restaurant where] they know I’m a concierge because the service will be perfect and it drives me crazy. I often would rather pay and get the real service, not always the concierge VIP service, because of course everything will be perfect. I’ll just sit down at the bar for lunch and see. They trump TripAdvisor and Yelp. Because when they give recommendations, they’re also reading and considering the guests. A lot of guests go on Yelp or TripAdvisor and tell me, ‘I’ve heard of this restaurant and know it’s a great restaurant.’ Sometimes I would say, ‘Don’t go because I’ve heard bad things and I was there myself.’ It’s a matter of being there, and some can have a great time and others not. They do talk about guests and store information on them. They’re going to commit things to memory but they’re also going to back it up with some software. We always know our guests and we learn from them. We have staff meetings to talk with each other and mention this guest or that guest to remember what he or she likes, or that he didn’t like this car service, of the SUV or Mercedes. And we have a system where we put everything in a profile so we know exactly what the guest likes, whether it’s white wine or red wine. If we are going to send an amenity we aren’t going to send champagne if we know that person prefers white wine or if he or she doesn’t drink we will send a fruit bowl. It’s very important to know your guests. They can get royally screwed. Concierges need to protect themselves (and their businesses) from the flights and fancies of guests with some sort of collateral. They’ll get those front-row Lion King on Broadway tickets but there’s going to be a credit card put down or form signed. We often have the guest give us their credit card and we swipe it in front of them so they know it’s been charged already. But I remember one of my concierges once had to pay $800 because a guest had asked for Broadway tickets and then said, ‘I don’t want them anymore.’ The concierge had already bought them from a broker and hadn’t made the guest sign, so he had to pay from his own pocket. They have their little helpers. We do have runners who just go here and there to get things, we concierges do go (physically) out of our way sometimes, like if a guest is sick and I don’t have a runner I’ll go to the pharmacy. A few years ago one of the guests was pregnant and she was really cold but didn’t want to buy a coat because she was leaving soon. So, I went home on my lunch break and just lent her my coat. Most guests do actually thank them. It’s not all outlandish guests asking for the moon to be handed to them five minutes without any niceties or thanks. Some people do know how much we work and a lot of them appreciate us. We get presents and gifts like gratuities, which is nice. Most who stay with us often will send us something at the end of the year, an envelope or presents, and also do that at the end of their stay. And we try to make it so they’re happy all the time so we’re happy, too. FREE AppDownload
