ShutterstockUnemployment is well above the Fed's economic target, and inflation is low and falling. So why is there even talk of the Fed slowing down QE (popularly called tapering)? Citi's foreign exchange expert Steven Englander explains the real motivation: a desire to curb speculation. Englander explains that in addition to economic improvement, this is the Fed's big worry. I would add concern that balance sheet expansion is generating returns driven by pure risk, rather than top line gains. The evidence: strong outperformance of dividend versus growth and NASDAQ stocks in the first four months of 2013, the bidding up of low quality EM debt markets, the boom in non-investment grade debt and the exponential improvement even in the worst hit US equity markets.†††† Putting together Bernanke testimony and WSJ, FT and Market News stories, we have a Fed that sees tapering as a priority even in an economy that creates less than 200k jobs per month. However, it still seems intent on using communications strategy to talk rates down even while pulling liquidity - hence the emphasis on possible two-way QE moves and ultra-low rates for an extended period. The Fed may be trying to promise low long-term rates for an extended period so that the it keeps the perceived benefits of low rates for activity while† unwinding froth. The implied commitment to investors is that the heat in the lobster pot will be turned up so slowly they will not even notice that they are being cooked.

REUTERS/Lance MurpheyAt 7:30 AM ET on Wednesday, FedEx will release its fiscal Q4 financial results. Analysts are expecting the package delivery company to announce earnings of $1.95 per share, down from $1.99 per share a year ago. FedEx ships a broad array of goods, and it has footholds all over the world.† As such, the company is widely considered to be a reliable bellwether of global economic activity. So, you can bet that FedEx's investors won't be the only ones following this announcement. Citi's Christian Wetherbee notes that air freight data from some of FedEx's major overseas hubs are showing growth, but slowing growth. "The air cargo terminals at Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Frankfurt collectively posted 0.9% YoY growth in F4Q (Mar- May), a deceleration from 2.2% growth posted in F3Q (Dec-Feb)," said Wetherbee who believes the company will likely announce capacity cuts overseas. However, he also expects the company to benefit from falling jet fuel prices. Wetherbee has a Buy rating on the stock with a $114/share price target.

A million more people joined the ranks of the global super-rich last year, almost a third of them in Asia, as soaring stock markets helped bolster the fortunes of wealthy investors. The number of "high net worth individuals" climbed by 10% in 2012, taking the total worldwide to 12m, according to research by Royal Bank of Canada and consultancy Capgemini. Between them, these twelve million people owned assets worth $46.2tn (£29.5tn) ñ more than three times the entire annual output from the US economy, and a 10% increase on 2011. A high net worth individual is defined as anyone with $1m (£641,000) or more in "investable assets". The definition excludes the value of a main home and of any "consumer durables" such as cars. World markets were volatile in the first half of 2012, as the eurozone crisis deepened; but after ECB president Mario Draghi promised to do "whatever it takes" to protect the single currency in July, and the Federal Reserve unleashed a drastic third round of quantitative easing in September, share prices recovered strongly, boosting the wealth of those with investments. The findings are likely to increase concerns that the benefits of central banks' radical policies to rekindle economic growth have accrued overwhelmingly to those at the top of society, while unemployment remains stubbornly high in many countries and incomes have been under severe pressure. Britain is home to the fifth-largest group of super-wealthy individuals, according to the report, with 465,000 super-rich individuals, up from 441,000 in 2011. The wealth report came as the latest UK inflation figures showed that with the consumer price index running at 2.7% in May wages for average British workers have now failed to keep up with prices for more than three years. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said, "economic stagnation has caused incomes to fall for most ordinary families but the wealth of the super-rich just keeps on growing. Unless this inequality is tackled Britain could experience a pretty joyless recovery, with the majority of the population seeing little or no benefit when economic growth returns." The US regained its place at the top of the league table in the report, as the home to 3.73m high net worth individuals, up by more than 11.5% on 2011, as the recovering property market helped repair the damage to wealthy investors' housing portfolios inflicted by the downturn of the past five years. The Asia-Pacific region was just behind the US, with a population of 3.68m super-rich investors ñ up by more than 9% on the year. Europe, where the economy of the single currency zone has now been in recession for 18 months, was home to 3.4m high net worth individuals, but saw a smaller rise in their number, of 7.5%, in 2012. The researchers also sub-divide the millionaires according to their wealth. There was an increase of 11% in 2012 in the number of people classified as "ultra high net worth individuals", the creme de la creme of the super-rich. These 110,000 people are worth $30m or more, and hold assets worth more than $16tn between them. A middle group of just over a million people, the "mid-tier millionaires", held $10tn-worth of assets between them; and a much larger group of 10.8m people, which the report refers to as the "millionaires next door", held assets worth $1m-$3m. The data also underlines the stark geographical divide in the distribution of wealth across the world, with just 140,000 of the 12m super-rich living across the entire continent of Africa. That was an increase of almost 10% from 2011; but still fewer than in Italy, Australia or Brazil. RBC and Capgemini's analysts forecast that the super-rich will continue getting richer, with the total wealth held by this group expected to expand by 6.5% a year over the next three years. The super-rich emerge from the survey conducted as part of the research as a relatively conservative group. They managed their assets cautiously in 2012, while fewer than half of them said they trusted financial markets; and fewer than 40% trusted regulators. The authors said the super-rich respondents to the survey, "exhibited a clear bias toward safety and wealth preservation, allocating nearly 30% of their financial wealth into cash and deposits." This careful approach applied to millionaires of, "all ages and wealth levels, suggesting that the overall lower level of trust in the financial markets may be playing a role."

YouTube / Nightly Business ReportMichael Hartnett and the investment strategy team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently warned that the "risks of a bond crash are high." "While our core asset allocation remains bullish on equities and bearish on bonds, the risks of a risk-negative bond crash a la 1987, 1994 and 1998 remain high enough to warrant short-term caution," wrote Hartnett today reiterating his warning. The team believes everyone should keep an eye out for the warning signals which preceded the last three crashes.¬† Here's BAML verbatim:
REUTERS/Larry DowningOn Monday evening, President Obama said in an interview, "Well, I think Ben Bernanke's done an outstanding job. Ben Bernanke's a little bit like Bob Mueller, the head of the FBI - where he's already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to." That raised some eyebrows and really turned up the volume on the conversation on Tuesday regarding potential successors to replace Bernanke when his term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve expires in January. In an interview with CNBC, former Fed Governor Larry Meyer said Obama "basically fired Ben Bernanke on the spot." "This is really remarkable," said Meyer. "I almost fell off my chair when I heard the President's remarks last night. He basically fired Ben Bernanke on the spot, and gave a fairly tepid testimonial afterward." When pressed on his comments, Meyer said, "Of course, it's unclear what the President wants. You know, there's always a bit of hyperbole when I talk, but look: the President said [Bernanke] stayed 'longer than he wanted to and was supposed to.' What does that mean? I am just befuddled. So, that's why I started like that." Meyer, who served with Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen on the Board of Governors in the 1990s, thinks Yellen is the most likely candidate to replace Bernanke next year.
Investors seem to fall a little bit less in love with Internet brokerage firms with each passing year. Overall investor satisfaction with self-directed investment firms dropped 16 points from 2012 in the latest J.D. Power &amp; Associates 2013 U.S. Self-Directed Investor Satisfaction StudySM. The study measures how happy investors are with not only their portfolio performance, but also their interaction with the brokerage, trading fees, account offerings, information resources and problem resolution. Scottrade and Charles Schwab topped this year's list, with 810 and 797 points out of 1,000, respectively. Vanguard and T. Rowe Price were hot on their heels in the 790 range. Three notable firms that scored well below the national satisfaction rating were Wells Trade, Merrill Edge, and Sharebuilder from Capital One. Why were investors so underwhelmed this time around? All the bells and whistles of e-brokerages can't replace the value of communication, which is where most firms fall short. "Although investment firms are offering more online tools and information for self-directed investors in 2013, the additional content and capabilities may actually make it more difficult to access the functions investors are seeking if a website is not easy to navigate and communication is not clear," the study says. Just one-third of firms actually contact their clients two or more times to keep them up to speed on services and products, down from 39% in 2012. But it's more than just communication. Investors are more confused about fee structure than ever before, with only 35% saying they understand fees, versus last year's 39%. "Investment firms miss an important opportunity to keep self-directed investors informed about fees, investor tools and other product offerings by not communicating in the manner and frequency that investors prefer," said Craig Martin, director of the wealth management practice at J.D. Power. "Firms need to know how their investors would like to be notified ‚Äî whether it occurs via email, phone or other means. It's important to contact investors proactively and at the appropriate frequency based on investor preference." Here are the top 10: JD Power Here's the key question you should ask before signing up for an online brokerage: How often do I plan on trading?  If you're an active trader (not that we recommend this approach for individuals), you'll have to really watch your trading fees. Some accounts charge anywhere from $5 to $200 per trade, depending on the extent of services you're looking for. In reality, the vast majority of online brokerage investors average only two trades a month, according to Lyons. If you're part of that "buy and hold" club (kudos to you), you might be better off taking your investments elsewhere. There are other hidden fees to consider as well. When Kiplinger rated 10 prominent online brokerage firms last year, it found Just2Trade was seemingly cheap at first glance, at $2.50 per transaction. But it charged a whopping $50 just to transfer your IRA to another firm, plus $35 to simply hold your IRA for you.
APThe Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the immigration bill currently being debated in the Senate would reduce the federal budget deficit by $875 billion over the first 20 years it becomes law.¬† The CBO said in its official scoring of the bill that it would reduce the deficit by $175 billion in its first 10 years of existence. Over the next decade, it would provide an additional $700 billion of deficit reduction.¬† That amounts to 0.2% of GDP. If the bill becomes law, the CBO estimated that about 10.4 million people would come to the United States as new immigrants. And it would legalize about 8 million people who currently live in the country as unauthorized immigrants.¬† The CBO's scoring of the bill pleased immigration reform advocates, the Senate "Gang of Eight" sponsors of the bill, and President Barack Obama. "Today, we have more proof that bipartisan commonsense immigration reform will be good for economic growth and deficit reduction: this time, in the form of a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate," the White House said in a statement.¬† "The Congressional Budget Office also made clear that passage of the immigration bill would not only reduce the deficit, it would increase economic growth for years to come.¬† By fixing our broken immigration system ‚Äì and making sure that every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules and paying taxes like everyone else ‚Äì we can grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, improve our fiscal outlook and create new opportunity for Americans everywhere." In the bill's first potential decade as law, the CBO predicted that it would increase federal spending by $262 billion, specifically for Medicaid and for subsidies provided¬†through insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. But it would also increase revenues by $459 billion because of the larger size of the labor force. In scoring the bill's second potential decade as law, the CBO broke with normal operating procedures. But because it said the bill would provide a "significant number of people" with federal benefits after 2023, it decided to score a second decade.¬† Here's the key chart:Congressional Budget Office
ReutersSpiking SHIBOR, an interest rate used among banks, has been showing signs of liquidity stress in China. We previously explained that the spike in SHIBOR,†or the Shanghai interbank offered rate, could be attributed to demand for cash ahead of the Dragon boat festival which took place last week, decline in Forex inflows, tax-related liquidity demanded, and a crackdown on illegal bond trading. UBS's Tao Wang writes that this was also because the central bank decided not to "backstop banksí every demand for liquidity." From Wang: "Banks have perhaps misjudged the PBCís policy direction earlier. With the economic data disappointing and inflation low, many in the market had expected the PBC to keep liquidity flowing or ease monetary condition further. However, with the central government apparently more tolerant for slower growth and concerned about financial risks, the PBC seemed to be keen to keep a ìprudentî policy stance."ÖThe PBC has made it clear in the past 10 days that overly-rapid credit expansion would not be accommodated and banks may have to scale down their credit growth plans and manage their own liquidity more prudently. Moreover, regulators are reportedly preparing steps to clean up interbank activities ñ some banks have used interbank transactions with banks and non- bank financial institutions aggressively to fund their lending or offload their loans ñ which could cause some unwind of such activities and lead to additional liquidity tightness." A central bank backed newspaper, cited by MNI News, also said the central bank isn't willing to step in. From MNI News: "The central-bank-backed newspaper cited several unidentified sources as saying that the PBOC is refusing to step in and bring relief to the market, and specifically those banks that have bypassed regulatory caps on lending and fallen into difficulty as liquidity conditions tighten. "'These banks are highly reliant on interbank borrowing to adjust their positions. They can manage their operations when capital inflows are high and regulators haven't tightened policy against non-bank financing... but when liquidity tightens because of sharply declining inflows, their liquidity becomes very tight,' it said." Remember, it's more than just spiking SHIBOR rates that has people worried. China Everbright Bank reportedly defaulted on 6 billion yuan of an interbank loan from Industrial Bank Co. earlier this month. China Everbright has since said that its relationship with Industrial Bank is fine.  China also had a failed debt auction on Friday, all of which raises concerns about Chinese liquidity. And banks that are pressuring the central bank for a reserve-requirement ratio cut could be disappointed. Here's a chart from Morgan Stanley that shows the recent surge in SHIBOR: Morgan Stanley

BloombergTVThere are gold bears, gold bulls, and gold bugs. And then there's Ron Paul. The former congressman and presidential candidate is known for favoring†gold, and he still believes it will go higher. How much higher? "Eventually, if we're not carefully, it will go to infinity, because the dollar will collapse totally," Paul said on CNBC.com's "Futures Now." A gold price of "infinity" might be hard to conceptualize, but Paul's point is actually quite simple. He believes that "as long as we have excessive spending, and excessive computerized money, we are going to see gold go up," because the value of the dollar will be driven down. As each dollar becomes less valuable, it takes more of them to purchase an ounce of gold, meaning that the gold price measured in dollars rises. Paul then takes it one step further. If Washington spending and†Federal Reserve†easing he refers to ends up toppling the U.S. economy and makes the dollar worthless, then no amount of dollars will allow an individual to purchase an ounce of gold. In that nightmare scenario, the price of gold (or anything else) in dollar terms is technically "infinity." Because of these larger forces undergirding his gold thesis, the unkind short-term action in gold doesn't worry Paul. "Markets do these types of thingsóthey go up sharply, and sometimes they take a rest," Paul said. "I was never very good on short term, whether it's the stock market, or whatever. But if you look at the record of the value of the dollar since the Fed's been in existence, we have about a 2-cent dollar. And gold used to be $20 an ounce. So I'd say the record is rather clear on the side of commodity money." "Six thousand years of history shows that gold always retains value," Paul added, "and paper always self-destructs." If the†U.S. dollar†does indeed "self-destruct," then no one will be particularly happy. But as Paul points out, people who exchanged dollars for gold will certainly be glad they did so while they still could.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidInvestors and traders fueled yet another big rally in the stock markets. First, the scoreboard: Dow:†15,318.2, +138.3, +0.9%S&amp;P 500:†1,651.8, +12.7, +0.7%NASDAQ:†3,482.1, +30.0, +0.8% And now, the top stories:
Since early May, interest rates on 30-year fixed rate mortgages†rose about half a percentage point,†from 3.6% to 4.1%, leading some analysts to wonder: Is the great once-in-a-lifetime chance to buy a house going away?"† The reality is that yes, rates are creeping up (emphasis on creeping) but prospective home buyers shouldn't be falling all over themselves to buy now.† Just over a year ago, a 4% mortgage rate would have been considered a record low for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.† While it's true that mortgage rates will likely keep rising, the overwhelming consensus from realtors and mortgage experts we spoke with is that consumers shouldn't be rushing their house hunt just yet. "People who are thinking of buying a home or are actively searching feel a sense of urgency as they hear that†mortgage†rates†and home prices are rising. Nobody wants to miss the boat," Bankrate.com senior mortgage analyst†Polyana da Costa, told Business Insider.  "That said, do I think people should or will buy homes just because†rates†are creeping up? No. Unlike with refinancers, homebuyers canít simply say 'I want to get a†mortgage†now before†rates†go up.' It takes time to find the home they want, especially in markets where inventory is tight."  A new report by Trulia offers some reassurance, as well, showing that as long as mortgage rates remain below 10.5%, it will still be†cheaper to buy a home than to rent in the U.S. What matters is what the homebuyer is looking for and how soon they want to buy. "For people looking for hard-to-find homes ñ like in a neighborhood with little inventory or homes with unusual features ñ they might do better waiting for more inventory even though it might cost more," said†Jed Kolko, chief economist for Trulia. Rising rates means it's cheaper to buy a home today than it will be next month, but that's just how it goes in real estate. Homebuyers rarely time their house hunt with the ebb and flow of the market.† "I don't think that interest†rates†rising a little bit will make someone speed up their search," said Zillow real estate expert†Brendon DeSimone. "Buying a home is not like buying a widget, or a car or stocks. †It has to be the right place for the right person. I can't imagine a homebuyer, looking for a 3-bed/2-bath home in school district X, all of the sudden buying a 2-bed/2-bed in school district Y just to get a better†rate. †It's just not realistic." His advice? Home buyers should take their time and shop around for the best home and the best rate.† "Be sure to shop around for the absolute best rate when you have a place in contract," he said. "Rates tend to fluctuate day to day so if you have the luxury of time, float for a couple of days. Work closely with a good local mortgage professional." Who is feeling the pressure? Those who haven't refinanced. In all the hype surrounding rising rates, what is realistic is that existing homeowners should lock in lower interest rates as soon as possible. In the past month alone, applications for†refinancing rose 5%, according to the Mortgage Banker's Association. For people paying more than 5% on a†mortgage today, they should find out if refinancing makes sense as soon as possible. People who have older loans at rates of 6% or 7% could save thousands by refinancing, even as rates are rising. "Get your documents ready, get quotes from a few different lenders and lock a†rate†as soon as you feel ready to begin the process," da Costa said. "For homebuyers who are still searching for a home, itís not as simple. But again, if you have found a home and the numbers work for you, go ahead and lock."†
Many people are baffled as to why anyone thinks it would be a good idea for King, maker of the super-addictive mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, to file an IPO. Bad things happen to mobile game companies who want to sell equity on the stock market, as Zynga has recently discovered. But then you hear about the guys who made Bejeweled ó†acquired for $700 million-plus in 2011 ó†and it becomes clear. Perhaps Candy Crush is the new Bejeweled, and perhaps King is the new PopCap.That, obviously is the temptation.Unfortunately, the odds are going to be against King. Here's why.Games are, by definition, fleeting and faddish. You can't even copyright them (only their names and branding). So competition is fierce. And no one needs them, the way they need food, housing or transportation. Games therefore seem like the very definition of something you should not invest in ó†and game companies seem like the kind of startups who might best remain private, where they can ride the financial roller coaster of the App Store behind closed doors.We got a recent glimpse of the terrors of game company economics from Zynga. In Q1 2013, its revenue declined 17% to $264 million, as users got bored of Farmville and Zynga Poker. 520 workers lost their jobs.Zynga acquired OMGPop for $180 million in 2012, to obtain its super hot Draw Something app brand. In 2013, it laid off the entire OMGPop staff. Few play Draw Something now. Yet over at Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, there are rumors of an upcoming IPO, too. The company has a new COO and a new board member, which makes people thinking it is planning a strategic move.Angry Birds is one of the most successful mobile games ever. Yet what little we know about Rovio ó†it's still private ó†suggests all is not well in the land of green pigs.A recent Forbes article pointed out just how one-note the company is. Its games include: Angry Birds, Angry Birds Space, Angry Birds Friends, Angry Birds Star Wars, Bad Piggies, Angry Birds Seasons, and Angry Birds Rio. It also does a lot of Angry Birds licensing, for toys and movies.Its latest product launch is expected to be Ö Angry Birds Go.Simon Moller, chief creative officer at Kiloo†ó†a company that makes Subway Surfers ó†believes Rovio is in trouble: ìThe games are the drivers of the brand and theyíre declining at a rapid pace.† They are relying on the plush toys to sell themselves, because all of their games are just the same gameÖ again.† Every time they launch a new game itís worse than the last one.îTake Moller with a pinch of salt. He's a rival, of course. But he has a point: How much further can Angry Birds possibly go before the demand for boomeranging toucans is satisfied?A Rovio IPO would be guaranteed to make at least one person rich, however. Kaj Hed, its current majority stockholder.† According to Arctic Startup: Ever since writing our, "Rovio's $42M Investment In 2011 Actually Went To Its Owners," we've been curious about the Angry Birds creator's ownership structure. What's most defining of the structure is is Kaj Hed's near 70% ownership through Trema International Holdings, followed by Niklas Zennstrˆm's Atomico Ventures and Accel Partners at roughly 10%. So why does King want to expose itself to this less-than-promising "next level"? PopCap, basically. In 2000, three guys ó†John Vechey, Brian Fiete and Jason Kapalka ó†invented Bejeweled, the gem-matching game that was originally played on the web. In 2011, after Bejeweled had become one of the dominant games on hundreds of millions of feature phones and then smart phones, PopCap was acquired by EA for ~$732 million, mostly in cash. Here are its revenues through 2010: EA In 2011, revenue grew grew 30%, EA reported.See those bars on the PopCap revenue chart, reaching smoothly for the sky, year after year? That's the lightning that King is hoping to rebottle.Maybe it will succeed. Maybe, like PopCap, King can grow its portfolio of addictive games so large that even if a few fall out of favor there are newer bigger ones to replace them. (PopCap has 169 different games, when you count versions for various platforms.)But even PopCap isn't immune from misfortune. It just laid off 96 people at its Dublin studio. EA said it wasn't sufficiently profitable. PopCap will be fine, of course. But that's the thing with games. More often than not they end with the phrase, "Game over."

Everyone knows the commodities supercycle is coming to an end as a result of slowing demand in China.¬† In a new note, Deutsche Bank's Taimur Baig and Jun Ma zero in specifically on the implications for declining global oil demand.¬† We just saw its (declining) prospects in BP's statistical energy review last week. Baig and Ma say global oil supply is likely to outstrip global demand for the rest of the decade, thanks to the U.S. shale boom ‚Äî which is also poised to go global (China has some of the world's largest shale deposits) ‚Äî and refining capacity that's about to come online. As a result, oil prices are going to be severely dampened in the years to come. Here's their projection: Deutsche Bank This could have profound effects in the Middle East, as we've previously suggested: If the US oil production surplus, for instance, ultimately leads to the Brent benchmark falling precipitously with WTI to a level below the fiscal and budgetary level for key oil producers in the Middle East, the economic strain could ultimately lead to potentially widespread social unrest in that region.¬†

In fact, fraud costs 3 percent of enterprise value ‚Äî and thus stock returns ‚Äî every year for the average U.S.-listed company, according to recent academic estimates. A new report from GMI Ratings shows that investors can significantly boost returns simply by looking out for certain red flags. When GMI eliminated the 25% of companies in the Russel 3000 index that scored the lowest on its fraud detection metrics, portfolio returns rose from¬†7.6% to 9.8% over a 10 year period, a 29% boost.

A June 6, 2013, article from¬†Reuters¬†is titled, ‚ÄúLawmakers in new drive to slash Iran‚Äôs oil sales to a trickle.‚Äù According to it, U.S. lawmakers are embarking this summer on a campaign to deal a deeper blow to Iran‚Äôs diminishing oil exports, and while they are still working out the details, analysts say the ultimate goal could be a near total cut-off. My concern is that the new sanctions, if they work, will put the United States and Europe in a worse financial position than they were before the sanctions, mostly because of a spike in oil prices. How much reduction in oil exports are we talking about? According to both the EIA and BP, ¬†Iranian oil exports were in the 2.5 million barrels a day range, for most years in the 1992 to 2011 period. In 2012, Iran‚Äôs oil exports dropped to 1.7 or 1.8 million barrels a day. Recent data from OPEC suggests Iranian oil exports (crude + products) have recently dropped to about 1.5 million barrels a day in May 2013.Gail TverbergFigure 1. Iranian oil exports, based on BP and on EIA data.If the ultimate goal is ‚Äúclose to total cut-off,‚Äù an obvious question we should be asking ourselves is whether it makes sense to handicap world oil production by close to 2.5 million barrels relative to 2011, or close to 1.5 million barrels relative to May 2013. Oil prices have spiked in the past when there has been an interruption in world oil supply. Why wouldn‚Äôt they this time? Furthermore, who are really handicapping: Ourselves or Iran? Possible Alternative Sources of Oil Supply I would argue that we do not have adequate sources of backup oil supply. We are operating too ‚Äúclose to the edge‚Äù when it comes to world oil capacity. Saudi Arabia likely has some spare capacity. If we go by how much Saudi Arabia in the recent past has been able to increase its production, its short-term spare capacity would appear to be about 600,000 barrels a day‚Äìnot nearly enough to offset the decline in Iran‚Äôs oil exports. The 600,000 barrels a day is calculated by comparing Saudi Arabia‚Äôs highest production for individual months of 2012 of 10.0 million barrels of oil a day with ¬†its actual production in May 2013 of 9.4 million barrels a day, according to the OPEC‚Äôs Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR). ¬†Saudi Arabia claims to have capacity of 12.5 million barrels a day, but its production in recent years has never been anywhere near its claimed capacity, raising questions about the truthfulness of the claim. How about exports from Iraq? This is a graph of oil exports from Iraq, based on EIA data.Gail TverbergFigure 2. Iraq oil exports, based on EIA production and consumption data.Iraq is indeed adding a little bit to world oil exports‚Äìabout 326,000 barrels a day in oil exports were added in 2012. But the wild fluctuations don‚Äôt provide confidence the trend will continue. It is possible to get a rough idea of what future increases in oil exports might amount to. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is targeting 6 million barrels a day of oil extraction for Iraq by 2020. (Dave Summers‚Äìalso known as Heading Out‚Äìisn‚Äôt confident even this can be achieved.) Extraction at this level would mean oil exports of about 4.5 million barrels a day in 2020. The expected annual growth in exports from today‚Äôs 2.2 million barrels a day of oil exports would be about 283,000 barrels a year, between now and 2020. Even if this rate of increase in oil exports is achieved, it won‚Äôt handle the immediate need for close to 1.5 million barrels a day of oil exports if Iranian exports are taken out of the world supply. How about the supposedly miraculous growth in US oil supplies? If we look at the actual data, we see that the United States is still a major oil importer, even when such sources as ‚Äúbiofuels‚Äù are included in the total. (Imports are the gap between the ¬†‚Äùconsumption‚Äù and ‚Äúproduction‚Äù lines.)¬†Gail TverbergFigure 3: US Liquids (oil including natural gas liquids, ‚Äúrefinery expansion‚Äù and biofuels) production and consumption, based on data of the EIA.At the same time, Europe keeps falling behind farther, so it needs increasing amounts of imports.Gail TverbergFigure 4: European Liquids (oil including natural gas liquids, ‚Äúrefinery expansion‚Äù and biofuels) production and consumption, based on data of the EIA.Thus, even if the US‚Äô need for imports is declining, Europe‚Äôs need for imports is increasing, as is the need for imports to Asia, including China and India. Losing part of the world‚Äôs oil supply makes it harder to get enough imports, without oil prices spiking again. If Oil Supply Cushion is Less Suppose that we somehow, miraculously, take Iranian oil exports off-line and find enough ¬†substitute supply without oil prices spiking too badly. We know too well from experience that there is the distinct possibility that part of current oil supply will later be taken off-line, for some unplanned reason. ¬†This might be another Arab Spring revolution, or perhaps fighting may break out between two oil producers. Or the United States may have a bad hurricane season. So even if oil prices don‚Äôt spike immediately, removing what little spare capacity there is, increases the likelihood that oil prices will spike in the future, from some unrelated cause. Who gets hurt with an oil price spike? The countries that are most hurt by high oil prices are the big oil importers‚Äìthe United States, the European Union, and Japan. We can see this with recent experience, shown in Figure 6 below. Oil prices have been high since 2005. ¬†These high oil prices have led to a cutback in consumption by oil importers, even as other countries more-or-less sailed along. The countries with lower oil consumption since 2005 are precisely the ones that have had problem with recession. See my post,¬†Peak Oil Demand is Already a Huge Problem.Gail TverbergFigure 5. Oil consumption based on BP‚Äôs 2013 Statistical Review of World Energy.If oil prices rise, more money will be transferred from oil importers to oil exporters. Oil exporters, such as the members of OPEC, will benefit. Of course, Iran itself will not benefit. Oil importing countries that have been having trouble with their debt loads are likely to have even more difficulty, because their citizens are made poorer by ¬†high oil prices. How Badly Do Sanctions Really Hurt Iran? The sanctions cause Iran to leave its oil in the ground until later. While this hurts the Iranian economy now, the oil will still be there for extraction later. With the fields ‚Äúrested,‚Äù Iran may even be able to increase the amount that can be extracted later. If oil prices are higher later, Iran will get the benefit of the higher prices. The oil supplies of other countries will also be more depleted then, so it will have more of an advantage than it does now. With all of the sanctions against Iran, the country has been encouraged to ramp up its natural gas production. It has also increased its fleet of natural gas-powered cars, so that it has more such cars than any other country in the world.¬†Iran is also refining more of its oil, making itself less dependent on gasoline imports. Making these changes now makes Iran more self-reliant in the long-run. A person might think that all of the sanctions to date have significantly reduced the standard of living of a typical Iranian. If this is true, it is not showing up much in the data. Prior to 2012, the economy had grown consistently for two decades. The sanctions led to an estimated decline in real GDP of -1.9% in 2012, according to the¬†CIA World Fact Book.¬†¬†Iran‚Äôs per capita use of energy has been rising, and continues to do so, even in 2012. Its per capita energy use is now higher than Italy‚Äôs.Gail TverbergFigure 6. Per capita energy consumption for Italy and Iran, based on BP total primary energy consumption from 2013 Statistical Review of World Energy, and EIA population data.There are obviously any number of other countries that Iran‚Äôs energy consumption could be compared to. If we compare Iran‚Äôs energy consumption to Israel, Iran‚Äôs per capita energy consumption is a little lower.Gail TverbergFigure 7. Per capita energy consumption for Israel and Iran, based on BP total primary energy consumption from 2013 Statistical Review of World Energy, and EIA population data.Messing with Iran‚Äôs Currency According to Bloomberg News, Useless Rial Is U.S. Goal in New Iran Sanctions, Treasury Says. According to the article: ‚ÄúThe idea is to cause depreciation of the rial and make it unusable in international commerce,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn July 1 we will have the ability to impose sanctions on any foreign bank that exchanges rial to any other currency or that holds rial-denominated accounts.‚Äù The move is intended to toughen sanctions that so far failed to press the Islamic republic to halt its nuclear program. According to the Treasury, the rial has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the past two years, trading at 36,000 per U.S. dollar as of April 30, compared with 16,000 at the start of 2012. Interesting! Isn‚Äôt devaluing the currency exactly what Japan and all of the countries doing Quantitative Easing have been trying to do, perhaps to a lesser degree? As a result, Iran‚Äôs stock market has been soaring. Iran is a country that has two export products that other countries want to buy: oil and natural gas. It has little debt, and in the past has been running a budget surplus. Making more rial to the dollar makes imports to Iran more expensive, but exports more competitive in the world marketplace. This is precisely what other countries have been trying to accomplish. I am skeptical this rial marginalization will work. Will these changes make any difference, in terms of trade with China and Russia? For that matter, will countries that want to buy natural gas from Iran stop trading with Iran? There are ways around any barriers we put up. The US dollar is the world‚Äôs reserve currency, but it is already under pressure in that role. Doesn‚Äôt all of this messing with the rial lead to more pressure to move away from the US dollar in its role as a reserve currency? Countries that have products to sell that are in short supply globally can usually find a way to sell them. The countries that seem to have much worse problems are those with nothing that the rest of the world wants to buy‚ÄìGreece, Spain, etc. Conclusion All of this posturing looks like a power struggle between the East and the West. ¬†The techniques the West has been using so far haven‚Äôt been working all that well. The plan is to step up the same techniques, in the hope they will work better. It is not all that clear that they will‚Äìif they work, they may quite possibly backfire, because we are working with¬†world oil supply, in a world where oil supply is still constrained. Reducing world oil supply by the amount of Iran‚Äôs oil exports doesn‚Äôt help the West at all. There have been a lot of exaggerated reports, seeming to suggest all is right now with world oil supply. The danger is that US leaders are now starting to believe what they read. Supply is now available, because of high price. Price is high because of the¬†problem of diminishing returns¬†leading to ever higher prices required to make oil extraction profitable for exporters.¬†Demand is now down in the West, because high prices are leading to job loss and recessionary forces there. Pushing the world further in this direction is hardly helpful. If we are very lucky, the United States‚Äô stepped up sanctions could get Iran to back down on its nuclear weapons program (assuming it has one). But if we are less lucky, we may find ourselves with spiking oil prices. To make things worse, we may see the role of the United States dollar as the world‚Äôs reserve currency destabilized. It seems to me that we are playing with fire.

At long last, it appears that Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf of Wall Street" is hitting the big screen. I say "at long last" because I first started writing about this movie way back in March 2007. In the six years since then, lots have happened‚Äîincluding a massive financial crisis. The trailer makes the movie look like plenty of fun. It's loaded with the tropes of Wall Street movies‚Äîdrugs, beautiful women who appear to have post-modern sensibilities, luxury means of transportation, men behaving badly, money raining through the air. But these aren't so much clich√©s as allusions or even formal aspects of the medium‚Äîwhat rhyme once was to poetry. The test of the artistry will depend on the how well the forms are executed. The movie is based on a book by the same title by a nasty piece of work named Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of swindling investors out of more than $100 million while he ran a pump and dump brokerage operation that went by the by the improbably WASP-y sounding name Stratton Oakmont. (Read More: Just Who IS Jordan Belfort?) He's supposedly reformed himself‚Äîalthough the book is at least as much a celebration of his debauchery as anything else. The book is full of detailed descriptions of sex, drugs and swindling. And, as they say, a good con-man knows how to make a buck going into the scam and another coming out. At least Belfort can only keep 50 cents on the dollars he makes "coming out." He's obligated to pay the investors he scammed 50 percent of his gross income until they receive $100 million. Even if this movie is the smash hit of the century, Belfort's not going to ever manage that. So you can see the movie without feeling guilty‚Äîor feeling less guilty, since some of the money should go to the victims. The film appears to be deeply committed to what you might call the Immoral Market Hypothesis: markets are irrational, manipulated and deliver the greatest rewards to those least enthralled by ethics. This, too, is part of the formal aspect of Hollywood depictions of Wall Street, easily recognizable from Oliver Stone's "Wall Street," "Boiler Room" and "American Psycho." It makes no difference that this story is based on truth. There are plenty of true stories in the world. Something about this story was so appealing to Scorsese that he optioned the book before it was even published. This wasn't just a true story about Wall Street Scorsese wanted to tell. It was the story‚Äîtrue or not‚Äîhe wanted to tell. Why does Hollywood insist on portraying Wall Street as a place of villainy? The late Larry Ribstein, a law professor seriously interested in how Hollywood portrayed business, crafted the best explanation I've come across: resentment. From his paper "Imagining Wall Street": [F]ilms' portrayal of business reflects the tension between filmmakers and the capitalists who finance them. The artists resent that the capitalists, on whom they depend to finance their productions, demand business rather than artistic success, forcing them sometimes to compromise their art. Filmmakers are more prone to this resentment than other artists, such as novelists, who may need to earn a living in a profit-obsessed world, but at least can create their works without having to deal with the capitalists. In other words, Hollywood hates Wall Street at a deep, personal level. Ironically, Wall Street doesn't mind this very much. Each of those movies I named above‚Äî"Wall Street," "Boiler Room," "American Psycho"‚Äîare loved by many who work on Wall Street. No doubt "The Wolf of Wall Street" aims at entering the pantheon. ‚Äî By CNBC's John Carney. Follow him on Twitter @Carney.
Wikimedia CommonsDeloitte has agreed to a one-year suspension from consulting work at New York regulated financial services firms and to pay $10 million to the state, Governor Andrew Cuomo's office said in a release. [via Dealbook] The settlement has to do with the auditor's past consulting work for U.K. investment bank Standard Chartered, which was slapped with money laundering allegations last summer. Back in August 2012, New York's Department of Financial Services released explosive allegations against Standard Chartered accusing it of facilitating billions of dollars in transactions for Iran, which is currently in under U.S. sanctions.¬† According to the New York regulator's complaint, Standard Chartered allegedly asked the U.K.-headquartered auditor to water down its reports.¬† From the NY DFS complaint:¬† 45. Having improperly gleaned insights into the regulators‚Äô concerns and strategies for investigating U-Turn-related misconduct, SCB asked D&amp;T to delete from its draft ‚Äúindependent‚Äù report any reference to certain types of payments that could ultimately reveal SCB‚Äôs Iranian U-Turn practices. In an email discussing D&amp;T‚Äôs draft, a D&amp;T partner admitted that ‚Äúwe agreed‚Äù to SCB‚Äôs request because ‚Äúthis is too much and too politically sensitive for both SCB and Deloitte. That is why I drafted the watered-down version.‚Äù ‚Äî Page 19 Here's the¬†release¬†detailing Deloitte's settlement:¬† Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that the Administration has reached an agreement with Deloitte Financial Advisory Services (‚ÄúDeloitte‚Äù) regarding the company‚Äôs misconduct, violations of law, and lack of autonomy during its consulting work at Standard Chartered on anti-money laundering issues. Under the agreement, Deloitte agrees to a one-year, voluntary suspension from consulting work at financial institutions regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (‚ÄúDFS‚Äù), will make a $10 million payment to the State of New York, and will implement a set of reforms designed to help address conflicts of interest in the consulting industry. DFS intends to use the reforms Deloitte has agreed to today as a model that will govern all independent consulting firms that seek to be retained or approved by DFS. These reforms could also potentially serve as a template for other government agencies that retain independent consultants in regulatory work. ‚ÄúThe State‚Äôs agreement with Deloitte will serve as a new model for reforming the financial services consulting industry in New York as well as across the country,‚Äù Governor Cuomo said. ‚ÄúWhen tasked by government agencies to undertake regulatory work at financial institutions, it is critical for these consultants to remain autonomous and avoid conflicts of interest. Our homeowners, investors and economy are protected when independent consultants are truly ‚Äòindependent.‚Äù Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent of Financial Services, said, ‚ÄúAt times, the consulting industry has been infected by an 'I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine' culture and a stunning lack of independence. Today, we are taking an important step in helping ensure that consultants are independent voices ‚Äì rather than beholden to the large institutions that pay their fees. Our aggressive work investigating and reforming the consulting industry is far from over and will continue in the days, weeks, and months ahead.‚Äù DFS‚Äôs Investigation into Deloitte's Work at Standard Chartered In 2004, Standard Chartered executed a joint written agreement with the New York State Banking Department (‚Äúthe Department‚Äù ‚Äì a DFS predecessor agency) and Federal Reserve Bank of New York (‚ÄúFRBNY‚Äù), which identified several compliance and risk management deficiencies in the anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act controls at Standard Chartered's New York branch. The agreement required Standard Chartered to retain a qualified independent consulting firm to review anti-money laundering issues at the bank. Standard Chartered engaged Deloitte to conduct that review. DFS‚Äôs investigation into Deloitte‚Äôs conduct during its consultant work at Standard Chartered found that the company: Deloitte Agreement To resolve the misconduct, lack of autonomy, and violations of law at Deloitte uncovered during DFS's investigation, Deloitte has agreed to: Here's a statement from Deloitte sent to Business Insider:¬† As a leading professional services firm, Deloitte¬†has an important responsibility to continually elevate the standards that govern our work and that of our profession. As such, Deloitte FAS has voluntarily entered into an agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services that resolves DFS‚Äô inquiry into Deloitte FAS‚Äô role in the 2004-2005 Standard Chartered Bank matter.¬†  We are pleased that, as the agreement states, a thorough investigation by DFS found no evidence that Deloitte FAS knew of, or aided, abetted or concealed any alleged violation of law by SCB. Deloitte FAS looks forward to working constructively with DFS to establish best practices and procedures that are ultimately intended to become the industry standard for all independent consulting engagements under DFS‚Äô supervision. It is important to note that, as the agreement also states: ‚ÄúThis is not intended to affect engagements performed by any Deloitte entity other than Deloitte FAS.¬† Neither the fact of this agreement nor any of its terms is intended to be, or should be construed as, a reflection of any of the other practices of Deloitte-affiliated entities.‚Äù
REUTERSPresident Clinton is applauded by members of his White House staff engaged in budget negotiations in the White House Rose Garden (May 16, 1997). UPDATE: The U.S. Senate confirmed Janet Yellen to become the 15th chair of the Federal Reserve on Monday, Dec. 6, 2014. It's looking increasingly likely that Ben Bernanke will no longer be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve at this time next year. In an interview Monday, President Obama said Bernanke has¬†"already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to." When asked about his intentions regarding plans for the future, Bernanke has not said much, though the Fed chairman has decided to skip this year's Jackson Hole summit of world central bankers in August, where he would normally be responsible for delivering the keynote address. In recent years, the Jackson Hole keynote has been an important stage for signaling big shifts in U.S. monetary policy, a key driver of economic dynamics not only in America, but around the world. This year, the most important signal from the keynote may not be in the contents of the speech, but in who is delivering it in Bernanke's place: Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who is widely tipped as the frontrunner to replace Bernanke when his term expires in January. If Obama does select Yellen to replace Bernanke, she will become the first woman ever to chair the Federal Reserve, putting her in arguably the most powerful policy-making role in the world. And of course, unless you follow the Fed, you've probably never heard of her. (Global financial markets have reinforced the notion that the Fed chair is all-powerful in recent weeks: as fears that the Fed will begin slowing the pace of its monetary stimulus have seeped into the marketplace, U.S. government debt has sold off dramatically, causing major reverberations in virtually every market around the world. Because U.S. monetary policy is so influential, economist David Beckworth, for example,¬†has referred to the Fed as a "monetary superpower.") By every account, Yellen is a thoughtful and brilliant economist, which has allowed her to rise to where she is today. "Ms. Yellen climbed the Fed ranks by being methodical rather than iconoclastic," writes Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath in a recent profile of the Fed vice-chairman. "She shows up at policy meetings with carefully crafted statements. Those who work with her say she arrives at the airport hours early." "[Yellen]¬†is very low-key, but impresses people quickly with the depth of her understanding and the sincerity of her views," said fellow Berkeley professor Andrew Rose¬†in 1994, describing her as "collegial, persuasive and effective." She has also worked with the academic elite of the economics sphere her entire career. Her mentor at Yale, where she received her Ph.D. in 1971, was Nobel-Prize winning economist James Tobin, whose legacy is enshrined in today's economics textbooks.¬†After graduating from Yale, she taught at Harvard for five years.¬†Then, she did a two-year stint (1976-1978) as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve, where she met her husband, fellow economist and future Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof. After the Federal Reserve, Yellen was faculty at the London School of Economics for two years. Then, in 1980, she accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley, where she stayed until her appointment to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Months before his April 1994 nomination of Yellen, Clinton had selected one of Yellen's long-time colleagues at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, to chair the Council of Economic Advisers (making Tyson his top economist at the White House). According to an L.A. Times report on Clinton's 1994 nomination of Yellen, Tyson was "deeply involved in the selection process for filling the Fed vacancies." The report went on to assert that "Yellen, who would succeed Republican Wayne Angell on the board, also fulfills the Administration's desire to name a woman or a minority to offset the appointment of [Alan] Blinder, a white male, to be Fed vice chairman." (Tyson herself was reportedly tapped by Clinton over then-World Bank economist Larry Summers because Summers and Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, didn't see eye-to-eye on issues related to environmental economics.) So began Yellen's long career in monetary policy-making, which has already been momentous in reshaping the directives that have emanated from the central bank and driven major changes in the global economic landscape. One of the defining moments for Yellen that crystallized both her economic views and her character traits came two years into her tenure on the FOMC. In a recent profile of Yellen, New York Times correspondent Binyamin Appelbaum tells the story: In July 1996, the¬†Federal Reserve¬†broke the metronomic routine of its closed-door policy-making meetings to hold an unusual debate. The Fed‚Äôs powerful chairman, Alan Greenspan, saw a chance for the first time in decades to drive annual inflation all the way down to zero, achieving the price stability he had long regarded as the central bank‚Äôs primary mission. But¬†Janet L. Yellen, then a relatively new and little-known Fed governor, talked Mr. Greenspan to a standstill that day, arguing that a little inflation was a good thing. She marshaled academic research that showed it would reduce the depth and frequency of recessions, articulating a view that has prevailed at the Fed. And as the Fed‚Äôs vice chairwoman since 2010, Ms. Yellen has played a leading role in cementing the central bank‚Äôs commitment to keep prices rising about 2 percent each year. Inflation has become one of the biggest stories in economics recently as annual inflation rates have been declining and seem stuck persistently below the Fed's 2.5% threshold for tightening monetary policy. Today's consumer price index release revealed that core price inflation remained stubbornly unchanged at 1.7% in May. Persistently below-target inflation readings have provided support for the argument that the Fed should continue with its controversial bond-buying program aimed at providing monetary stimulus to the economy. As arguably the most dovish member of the FOMC ‚Äì meaning she tends to focus on unemployment concerns rather than keeping inflation at bay ‚Äì Yellen has undoubtedly had a big role in shaping the course of current policy. Yet Yellen's record shows that she has not always argued for easy monetary policy and higher inflation, despite her dovish tilt. Later in 1996, the economy was expanding, labor markets were tight, but core inflation was on a steady downward trend. At the September 1996 FOMC meeting, though, Yellen argued, "I¬†conclude that the risk of an increase in inflation has definitely¬†risen, and I would characterize the economy as operating in an¬†inflationary danger zone." While Yellen ultimately supported then-Chairman Alan Greenspan's decision to leave interest rates unchanged, she couched her decision by saying, "I find myself very close to the margin and¬†would also have been quite willing to support an upward adjustment of¬†25 basis points today, had you proposed that." In 1996, Yellen's argument rested on the thesis that the labor market was too tight. To be sure, things are much different now ‚Äì the unemployment rate remains stubbornly elevated around current levels at 7.6%, and concerns over inflation appear to be all but dead at this point. And given the Fed's current policy stance ‚Äì committed to unprecedented monetary easing until signs of improvement in the labor market re-emerge ‚Äì perhaps it's just as accurate to say that Yellen has already become the most powerful woman in history. Taking over the chairmanship in January would cement it.
When it comes to satisfaction,¬†bank customer service¬†has not always been leading industries ‚Äî but it seems that¬†banks¬†are finally listening to customers and trying to meet their needs. Large, institutional banks have experienced the biggest movement in positive reviews over the past year, according to findings in J.D. Power &amp; Associates‚Äô 2013 U.S. Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. While retail banks overall saw an increase in¬†bank customer service ratings¬†of 10 points in 2013 over 2012, big banks saw an even bigger margin with increased satisfaction of 16 points. Bank Customer Service Making Up for Fees Things have improved in large part because¬†bank fees¬†have stabilized with new financial regulations, and customers better understand how the new fees impacted their individual transactions. But banks are still looking for ways to make more money with new products and services, as new financial regulations have made traditional banking products less profitable, according to a¬†Business Insider report. One way banks are making new fees more palatable is to give patrons the¬†best customer service¬†possible. By giving their customers top-notch service, banks can make up for other drawbacks. ‚ÄúResearch shows that great service can play a key role in customer retention,‚Äù documented by variations in fee schedules, notes Paul Logan in an article on¬†AmericanBanker.com. In light of fees, he explains, banks can still mitigate customer dissatisfaction with exemplary customer service that solves their problems. He says that the¬†best bank customer service can ‚Äúpositively affect a bank‚Äôs business and its bottom line.‚Äù Our Top 5 Picks for the Best Bank Customer Service Go Banking Rates would like to let you know that customer service is alive and well. Here are five banks that provide rave-worthy customer service: #1.¬†Charles Schwab Charles Schwab is the highest-rated bank in the ‚ÄúOverall‚Äù category, according to MyBankTracker.com. The site‚Äôs users gave Charles Schwab‚Äôs customer service representatives high marks, of four out of five stars. User Erickjackson0 says his experiences have been ‚ÄúEasy and stress-free,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe few times I‚Äôve spoken with customer service, the reps have been professional.‚Äù #2. Capital One 360 Capital One 360 is another institution spotlighted by MyBankTracker for great bank customer service.

Directly or indirectly, the Federal Reserve's extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy has contributed to the performance of the U.S. financial markets since the financial crisis. "Since the Fed began its non-conventional monetary policy in late November 2008, US assets prices have been strongly inflated, including cyclical ones such as Equities and Commodities, even despite poor economic growth," wrote Societe Generale's Alan Bokobza. Bokobza¬†offers the chart below of various U.S. asset class returns since November 2008. What are his expectations should the Fed start to taper, or scale back, its bond-buying program.

As chilling images of the protests in Brazil are beamed across the world, it's only natural that the country looks to its leaders for answers. But as Fohla de Sao Paulo, the country's largest circulating newspaper, points out, even President Dilma Rousseff has no answers. The paper's op-ed page echoes what people across the world are thinking ó 'Nobody knows what is happening'. According to reports, the protests were sparked by a public transportation fare hike and eventually built to 200,000 Brazilians taking to the streets to demonstrate against corruption, violence, and poor public services. But how to begin to address those massive concerns and stop the chaos? From Fohla de Sao Paulo: All that President Dilma Rousseff managed to say (through a spokesperson), on an absolutely spectacular day like yesterday, was that youth protests are legitimate. Ok, they are, yes. But so what? And the demonstrations that are not only by the young are not totally peaceful?... If there is a consensual recognition that the increase of the fares was a simple detonator, no authority in any instance has learned so far enough to venture an assessment of what is happening in the country and point out what - and who - is behind it. It all seemed so wonderful in the Brazil oasis, and suddenly we are reliving the demonstrations of Tahrir Square in Cairo, so suddenly, without warning, without a crescendo. We were all caught by surprise. From paradise, we have slipped at least into limbo. What is happening in Brazil? The difference between Brazil and Egypt, the op-ed goes continues, is that Egypt had an end game ó topple the authoritarians. But what to do in Brazil where the authoritarians are gone? How to appease the masses when what they want is so diverse, so hard to materialize, so unclear? Worrisome stuff. For the full op-ed, head to Fohla de Sao Paulo&gt;
AP ImagesCyprus' president is asking EU leaders to completely alter the country's $13 billion bailout. This is according to an exclusive report from the FT's Peter Spiegel. President¬†Nicos Anastasiades warned in a letter¬† that the small island nation might not be able to meet the terms of the rescue agreement because it had harmed the country's economy too much. From the Financial Times: ‚Äú[T]he economy is driven into a deep recession, leading to a further rise in unemployment and making fiscal consolidation all the more difficult,‚Äù Mr Anastasiades wrote to the heads of three EU institutions and the International Monetary Fund. ‚ÄúI urge you to review the possibilities in order to determine a viable prospect for Cyprus and its people.‚Äù Mr Anastasiades has asked EU leaders to unwind the complex restructuring and partial merger of its two largest banks, which account for 80 per cent of the domestic banking sector, backed by further eurozone loans. A senior official told the FT that failure to prepare for the bailout ¬†-- which forced the closure of its second-largest bank, restructured its largest bank, and took a haircut from depositors -- was partially the fault of the Cypriot government.

Reuters / Steve MarkusHedge-fund chief Dan Loeb has upped his firm's stake in Sony and has urged the company to launch an initial public offering of its music and movies wing, the Wall Street Journal reports. Loeb's firm, Third Point LLC, recently bought five million more Sony shares. It now holds a total of 70 million shares, nearly 7% of the company. The Journal obtained a letter from Third Point to Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai asking the company to consider spinning off its entertainment division. From the Journal: Mr. Loeb, whose Sony stake now amounts to roughly $1.4 billion and makes Third Point one of the company's largest shareholders, is seeking to ride a wave of potential change in Japan's traditionally staid corporate sector and in its wider economy. Mr. Loeb has argued that Sony could boost its share price dramatically by following his proposals, which he says would prompt the market to more fully value the company's entertainment assets. In the letter, Loeb writes that Sony entertainment lacks the "discipline and accountability" of its contemporaries, and would benefit from the transparency of an IPO and an "expert board with strongly aligned incentives." Loeb offered to serve on the board. ¬† According to Loeb, an IPO of Sony's entertainment wing could raise as much as $2 billion. Read the full report from the Wall Street Journal&gt;
REUTERS/Agustin MarcarianIn the Recoleta neighborhood of Buenos Aires, just across from the cemetery containing Evita Peron‚Äôs tomb, a currency exchange shop that offers the official dollar exchange rate stands empty. Yet just a mile away, not far from the headquarters of the Central Bank, the currency trade is booming. It‚Äôs impossible to walk more than 20 feet without encountering an arbolito, translated literally as ‚Äúlittle tree,‚Äù one of the men and women who claim to change money at the best black market rates. They are known as arbolitos because they stand planted for hours in one spot and offer handfuls of greenbacks to everyone who passes. Argentina may be known for inventing the tango, but it is also the country with the highest number of psychoanalysts per capita. One can hardly blame Argentines for needing to talk to someone. Despite a prolonged period of economic and monetary stability in the 1990‚Äôs, the country‚Äôs economic history is characterized by periods of upheaval, hyperinflation, and currency instability. Although these periods of destabilization are destructive to the long term health of the economy, they also create short-term periods of arbitrage for those with the means and connections to take advantage of market dislocations. I first lived in Buenos Aires as a student in the 1990‚Äôs. At that time, the country hitched its currency to the US dollar at one-to-one parity under the much-heralded Convertibility Plan. Convertibility ended in 2002 and the peso has steadily devalued to the current level of about 5.3 pesos to the dollar. Over the years, I‚Äôve returned to Argentina with some frequency as a tourist, a private equity investor, and more recently as an investor in the technology sector. Although I had heard about currency arbitrage in the past, I always thought it was something that died out in the 1980‚Äôs. As I planned my most recent trip in early June to Argentina, however, I learned that I was mistaken. Tell any Argentine that you‚Äôre going to visit Buenos Aires these days and you‚Äôll be met with the same response: bring dollars. Over the past year, the spread between the official exchange rate and the black market rate ‚Äì know as the D√≥lar Blue - has widened to over 90% at times. As a result, foreigners and the relatively small percentage of Argentines with access to dollars now integrate the D√≥lar Blue into their daily lives. The first rule of Argentina in 2013? Don‚Äôt pay for anything with a credit card if you‚Äôre a foreigner. Changing dollars to pesos makes everything one could ever want to buy, from steak to leather to your hotel, far less expensive. Although operating in the D√≥lar Blue market is technically illegal, the parallel exchange is the worst kept secret in Argentina. Still, this is not your father‚Äôs black market. In a fascinating twist, the parallel market leverages traditional and social media to expand its reach and improve transparency. The leading daily newspapers, Clar√≠n and La Naci√≥n, each publish the parallel rate in their business sections alongside the official exchange rate. A D√≥lar Blue Facebook page has over 17,000 ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and @dolarblue tweets out updated rates to some 26,000 followers. Ironically, for a market that operates with such transparency, none of the people I spoke to in Argentina could tell me how the D√≥lar Blue got its name. Despite these published rates, insiders enjoy a distinct advantage when actually changing currency. Argentines who operate in the black market maintain long-standing relationships with trusted cuevas or caves, the underground shops that change dollars. Where these cuevas charge the D√≥lar Blue rate minus a commission of less than 3%, changing money on Calle Florida, a busy pedestrian street in the center of the city, will likely entail a discount of 5 to 8%. The cuevas aren‚Äôt the only place where dollars are changed for pesos at favorable rates. Most business owners are willing to cut deals on the spot. I changed dollars for 7.5 at a pizzeria, settled for 8 in a taxi, and agreed on 8.5 among friends at a nightclub. I did learn, however, that I‚Äôd made a rookie mistake by bringing twenty-dollar bills rather than 50‚Äôs or 100‚Äôs. Smaller bills trade at a discount since the market for larger currency is more liquid and higher denominations are more efficient to transport. While tourists carrying dollars are clear beneficiaries of the D√≥lar Blue, the real action and volume in the market is driven by the subset of individuals and businesses in Argentina that have access to dollars. El Cronista, the Argentina business daily, recently estimated that there is as much as US$40 billion hidden away in some 700,000 safety deposit boxes in the country. That‚Äôs in addition to cash kept abroad in placed like Uruguay, Switzerland, and the United States. Cash kept overseas can be imported the old-fashioned way- in a suitcase in bundles of less than $10,000 ‚Äì or via online money transfer services, such as www.xoom.com, that cater to Argentines. Since its debut in 2011, the government of President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner has struggled to intervene in the black market, albeit with little success. Most recently, the government is pressuring the cuevas to suspend trading to take liquidity out of the market. Fern√°ndez de Kirchner is anxious to curb the parallel market because she understands what each of her constituents knows by heart: the very existence of the D√≥lar Blue signals that something is gravely wrong with the Argentine economy. The patient is very sick. With each oscillation of the D√≥lar Blue, there is increasing uncertainty in the air. The spread between the official and black market exchange rates increased from 40% in the beginning of 2013 to over 90% in early May, before retreating to 60% at present. The widening spread creates a clear incentive to dump pesos, either into dollars or consumer goods like televisions or appliances. No one wants to be holding pesos when the system breaks down and as more Argentines clamor for dollars, the pressure on the exchange rate only increases. Yet Argentines know that the D√≥lar Blue, like other black markets of the past, will eventually disappear. As one friend commented wearily over a glass of Malbec, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived through this before. We Argentines know how to deal with these things. We‚Äôve just had to learn to adapt.‚Äù
All eyes and ears will be on Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve tomorrow as it wraps up its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and updates us on the direction of monetary policy. Investors and traders will be listening for any clues regarding the "tapering," or gradual reduction, of the Fed's quantitative easing, or bond-buying, program. In a research note to clients today, Societe Generale's Alain Bokobza looks back at Japan's experience with QE tapering in 2006. "In March 2006, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced the exit from QE, amid signs that activity was accelerating and the economy was emerging from deflation," noted Bokobza. "The BoJ exit provides interesting insights regarding what we may expect from the Fed in the coming quarters." Here's more: During the quarters around the end of QE, 10y Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields increased by almost 100bp; from 1.1% at mid-2005 to 2.0% in May 2006. The Nikkei declined by 20% between April and June 2006 after having increased by 60% in the preceding 12 months (see chart). The sell-off was nonetheless short lived. The exit from QE in Japan was conducted in just 3-4 months, mainly by reducing the amount of bills purchased from private banks, i.e. the most flexible asset on the BoJís balance sheet. Holdings of longer-term JGBs were reduced very slowly and moderately; the BoJ actually kept in place its regular purchases of longer-term JGBs. The BoJ also implemented liquidity operations to ensure the stability of interbank money markets. Business Insider
Brazil is currently gripped by its largest protests in 20 years ó about†200,000 demonstrators marched through the streets of Brazil's biggest cities on Monday ó driven by†public frustration over shoddy public services, police brutality, economic instability, and government corruption.† The turmoil, which has been simmering for months, arises as the country hosts†the Confederations Cup soccer tournament (i.e. the preliminary for next year's World Cup) and prepares for a visit from the pope next month. Images being shared on social media†show police beating unarmed protesters with batons, in addition to dispersing crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas, and have only caused the protests to expand. The terrifying event shown below happened in Rio de Janeiro, where local police said 100,000 people had gathered on Monday evening. It seems that the most dangerous thing the woman is carrying is a cigarette. AP [UPDATE 2:56 EDT] A reader claims that the police officer pictured here is spraying the woman pictured with a cooling agent that "actually helps to calm the effects of pepper spray."†The AP caption reads: "A military police [officer] pepper sprays a protester during a demonstration in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Monday, June 17, 2013." From NYC Mag: The photographer,†Victor Caivano, tells Daily Intelligencer that the woman, who appeared to be a "normal, middle-class university student," was standing completely alone at around 11:20 p.m. yesterday on a "deserted corner" after the police had cleared the area.†"The protest was over, riots included," Caivano says.† Three riot officers approached the woman and told her to leave. When she resisted ó the woman either questioned the order or insisted that she wasn't doing anything wrong, Caivano recalls ó†she was†pepper-sprayed. "This policeman just didn't think twice," Caivano says.† AP Photo/Victor R. Caivano As we saw recently in Turkey, a single photo of a protester being sprayed†with tear gas†at point blank range can galvanize a movement instead of quashing it. REUTERS/Osman Orsal "The lady in red" And as we saw in the case of†University of California-Davis, pepper spraying people who are peacefully protesting never looks good and can be costly for authorities. Wayne Tilcock, The Davis Enterprise Here's how†Todd Benson and Asher Levine of†Reuters, reporting from Sao Paulo (where 65,000 people gathered on Monday),†described the overall situation: Contrasting the billions in taxpayer money spent on new stadiums with the shoddy state of Brazil's public services, protesters are using the Confederation's Cup as a counterpoint to amplify their concerns. The tournament got off to shaky start this weekend when police clashed with demonstrators outside stadiums at the opening matches in Brasilia and Rio. "For many years the government has been feeding corruption. People are demonstrating against the system," said Graciela CaÁador, a 28-year-old saleswoman protesting in Sao Paulo. "They spent billions of dollars building stadiums and nothing on education and health." Here's a picture of the streets of Rio (there's a Vine too): AP
Even as Brazil prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, the economy has been grappling with slowing growth. Locals have taken to the streets to protest inadequate infrastructure and rising costs to host the World Cup. President Dilma Rousseff has said people have engaged in "information terrorism" through the media. But it is evident that the country needs some structural reforms to help revive growth. We walk you through five key talking points on Brazil's economy: Inflation - Brazil's inflation reached 6.5% in 12 months through May. Strong private consumption, supply shocks, "17% average exchange rate depreciation in 2012," easy fiscal and monetary policy, and a rise in import duties, all drove inflation higher. The concern is that rising inflation will hurt real wages and consumption. BBVA Research Wage inflation and competitiveness - "As a consequence of both the sharp increase in domestic wages (due to a tightening of the labor market) and the appreciation of the exchange rate, labor costs in dollars increased sharply (more than 300% since the end of 2002), matching productivity gains and then eroding Brazilís competitiveness," according to BBVA Research. BBVA Research Credit growth hits a wall - Credit-fueled consumption growth has hit a wall in Brazil. The government needs to address the issue but it's unclear if they will considering elections are coming up in 2014. Societe Generale GDP growth is slowing† - Brazil's economy grew a mere 0.9% in 2012. Rising wages hurt the Brazilian economy as the country lost competitiveness. The credit-fueled consumption growth maxed out also hurting economic growth. Along with other issues like poor infrastructure and high taxes. BBVA Research The current account deficit is deteriorating - "The current account is deteriorating as real exports of goods and services declined sharply in Q1 against a big jump in imports." But the decline in balance of payments (BOP) is nearly done, according to Societe Generale. Morgan Stanley analysts see no reason to panic about the decline in BOP, and attribute most of the rapid decline to "accounting errors from the customs authority." Societe Generale
Central bank policies have distorted markets to such a degree that investors are devoid of any buy-and-hold asset classes, according to James Montier. But according to Richard Bernstein, the flood of liquidity unleashed through quantitative easing (QE) now offers investors compelling opportunities. Montier is a member of the asset allocation team at Boston-based Grantham Mayo van Otterloo. Bernstein is the chief executive officer of New York-based Richard Bernstein Advisors. The two squared off in a panel discussion at the 2013 Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago last week. ìThis is the hardest time to be an asset allocator,î Montier said. ìNormally, you find that safe-haven assets are expensive and riskier assets are cheap ñ and vice versa. But today, largely because of the central banks around the world, weíve got a very distorted opportunity set, such that there is nothing you can buy and hold.î Bernstein agreed that QE has upset traditional valuation dynamics, but he said investors still have choices. ìThere are pockets that are very, very attractive,î he said. ìPeople are generally unaware of those pockets.î Letís look at the key assumptions around Federal Reserve policies that led these two investors to such divergent views of the markets. Fed policy and its impact on the markets Low inflation and low interest rates have driven most asset classes to unacceptably high valuations, Montier said. Montier explained that GMO uses a valuation methodology based on reversion to the mean. It looks at metrics such as margins, earnings and sales growth, then analyzes what the impact will be on prices if those values revert to their long-term averages over a seven-year time horizon. Those forecasts are published on GMOís website. As of the end of May, stocks ñ with the exception of emerging markets, which I will come back to in a moment ñ offered real (inflation-adjusted) returns ranging from -3.1% to 3.4%. Bonds were even worse ñ only emerging debt had a positive expected return. The U.S. economy remains ìmiles awayî from the Fedís preconditions for ending its QE measures, Montier said. The Fed explicitly stated that unemployment must fall below 6.5% and inflation must rise to 2.5% before it will tighten. Right now, with 7.6% unemployment and 1% inflation (measured, as the Fed does, by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)), Montier said it is unlikely the Fed will tighten any time soon. Since the end of 2012, Montier said the market has made a ìhugeî shift, from pricing in 20-plus years of financial repression to assuming that repression will end in the next decade. That has resulted in a steepening of the real-interest-rate term structure. Inflation is unlikely to accelerate, Montier said. People who fear that the Fedís ìprinting moneyî will lead to inflation donít understand how QE works, he said. The Fed is buying long-term bonds and issuing massive amounts of short-term debt, according to Montier, which wind up in bank reserves. ìThere is no printing of money per se,î he said. The velocity of money has collapsed, he said, and neither demand-pull or cost-push mechanisms are likely to revive it and create inflation. Too much slack in the economy ñ such as high unemployment ñ makes demand-pull inflation unlikely. Commodity prices arenít increasing, he said, so cost-push inflation wonít unfold.† Montier said in the 1970s, Americaís highly unionized workforce drove higher commodity prices into higher wages and prices. Unions play a smaller role in todayís workforce, virtually eliminating that threat, according to Montier. Meanwhile, Bernstein agreed with Montier about the likely direction of Fed policy but said that investors donít have to be overly conservative. Fed policies have created a distaste for certain asset classes among investors, Bernstein said, based on a mistaken belief that they wonít do well over the next five or seven years. He said the key is to find asset classes rejected by other investors, where investors can be the equivalent of a ìsingle banker in a town of 1,000 borrowers.î Read the rest at AdvisorPerspectives.com &gt;
YouTube/gzfraudThe man who gave Martha Stewart the stock tip that sent her to prison is back in the news. This time Dr. Samuel Waksal ‚Äî¬†who advised Stewart to sell all of her ImClone shares when he learned his firm's cancer drug wouldn't attain FDA approval¬†‚Äî is being sued for $4 million by a former associate, according to the New York Post. From the Post: A former business associate, Kevin Glodek, charges that Waksal used him to raise capital for the new firm, then cut him out of millions of dollars in promised commissions, according to the civil suit filed Friday in Manhattan Supreme Court. Glodek, 37, claims he‚Äôs owed the $4 million fee from a $40 million transaction in 2012 between Waksal and two investors based on a written agreement. Before serving five years in prison for the insider trading scandal, Waksal was a titan of the biotech industry and a popular New York socialite. He even dated Stewart's daughter for nearly four years. His fall was as epic as his rise.
Flickr/TexasDarkHorseDo you have a computer? Good. Now you can be a quant trader. For years, complex algorithmic trading has been a major profit generator for Wall Street banks and hedge funds. It has also been a source of employment for programming prodigies ‚Äî¬†and a source of stress for regulators. But thanks to the new Manhattan-based startup EquaMetrics, average Joes can now quant trade from the comfort of their own homes. CNN Money reports: EquaMetrics' app is simply designed and since its software firepower comes from the cloud, it doesn't require anything more than the typical PC. You can drag and drop colored tiles to assemble your own algorithm. Day traders can choose between 30 variables to build their formulas. The options are built on so-called technical indicators, metrics that reflect trading patterns as opposed to stock fundamentals such as the price-earnings ratio. After you're done, you run the program to buy and sell stocks and currencies. Wonderful! It's not like quant trading has ever gotten Wall Street into trouble before. Should be no problem to equip the everyman investor with supercomputing. CNN Money reports on the co-founder's rebuttal: Ivey offers two defenses. First, EquaMetrics isn't offering high frequency trading, which is the business of Knight Capital and involves buying and selling hundreds of times per second. In fact, EquaMetrics allows traders to assemble strategies that scan stocks or currencies no faster than once a minute. (Ivey's own best performing programs kick in just once a day.) Second, the company isn't targeting widows or laypeople looking to play with their retirement accounts. Though there's no minimum to invest, early EquaMetrics clients are either sophisticated traders who buy and sell on technical indicators, or institutional investors who want to assemble an automated trading system but can't afford to hire a quantitative programmer. The web application only costs $99 a month or $250 a month, depending on your chosen cocktail of algorithms.¬† For more on this, head to CNN Money&gt;

Today, the Federal Reserve begins its two-day long Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to discuss and determine the direction of monetary policy. Without question, this is the most important event of the week, and some would argue that it is the most important event of the year. What the Fed says tomorrow has the potential to move the global financial markets in a big way. As such, investors and traders will do whatever they can to get ahead of the curve. One way they do this is by paying close attention to the "Fed-watchers."¬† And a few Fed-watchers in financial journalism have earned reputations for being so close to the Fed that they are seen as implied mouth pieces to leaks. Like this crop of¬†the biggest Federal Reserve journalists, who can actually move markets¬†with the slightest hint that the Fed may¬†‚Äî or may not¬†‚Äî act on its plan to slow down its quantitative easing program. Rarely do beat reporters have such a profound economic impact on the subject they cover. So who exactly are the deeply-sourced Fed reporters capable of sending our fickle markets into a tizzy with their every word? We've compiled a list of the top 6 financial journalists covering the Fed. YouTube/BizAsiaAmerica Harding, the FT's Fed-watcher, sent stocks plummeting when his story "Fed likely to signal tapering move" hit the web Monday. But Harding balked,¬†tweeting, "But people need to chill out. The Fed does not leak anything to any journalist to steer markets - especially during blackout." Harding previously worked as a Tokyo correspondent for the FT before attaining the near-singular ability to move the stock market with his reporting. Follow him on Twitter:¬†@RobinBHarding YouTube/BookTV Neil Irwin as a WaPo columnist and frequent voice on Wonkblog, Ezra Klein's popular spot for policy analysis. He also recently authored a book about how central banks tried to combat the financial crisis. From 2007-2012, Irwin covered the Fed for WaPo, and has reported on economics and other topics for the paper since 2000. Irwin is more columnist than he is reporter now. So while he's not generating scoops, his analysis ‚Äî¬†which takes a "let's step back and really think about this" approach¬†‚Äî¬†is a must-read if you're a Fed watcher. Follow him on Twitter: @Neil_Irwin YouTube/PBSNewsHour Appelbaum is a Washington-based reporter covering the Fed for The New York Times. He has worked as a reporter for the Florida Times Union, The Boston Globe, The Charlotte Observer, and The Washington Post. He is a constant presence at Fed press conferences, once pushing Ben Bernanke on whether his current views as chairman conflict with his scholarly work from his time as an academic, specifically concerning Japan. Among his other scoops, at WaPo Appelbaum broke the news that the administration had plans for a financial watchdog that would later become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.¬† This solidified Applebaum as a reporter with some high-level sources. Follow him on Twitter: @BCApplebaum YouTube/Common Sense CapitalismSquawk-Boxer Steve Liesman is CNBC's senior economics reporter.

Liesman worked at The Moscow Times, an English language newsdaily after beginning his career as a business reporter in Florida. Liesman seems to always have the inside track when it comes to the Fed. In April, when Fed minutes appeared online five hours earlier than usual, Liesman first reported it was because the minutes had been leaked to lobbyists the day before. He also reported in May that the Fed and US Treasury were investigating whether Bloomberg journalists were tracking government officials' terminal use.

He joined the magazine in 2008 from the Wall Street Journal. He is also the author of "The Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World," an explainer for the common man. Ip is a shrewd Fed thinker, and last year¬†asked¬†Chairman Bernanke the tough question: "Economists have long¬†believed that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run. That‚Äôs one¬†reason you‚Äôve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.¬†Can you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to an unemployment¬†threshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view? And, if it‚Äôs¬†consistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only? And would the¬†approach that you‚Äôre now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?" In a recent interview with CNBC, Ip indicated people should look to the Fed's forecast of the path of the economy in Wednesday's announcement, and¬†Fed watchers listened.

The Journal's Fed reporter recently blogged that he expected the Fed to take a more dovish tone this week, his one cryptic sentence helping gold, stocks, and bonds enjoy a fervent Hilsenrally as markets closed. Hilsenrath, the Journal's D.C. correspondent, has been working at the paper since 1997 and contributed to their Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Sept. 11th attacks. A mainstay on CNBC, Hilsy¬†reportedly has better access to Ben Bernanke than anyone, so much so that FT Alphaville calls him¬†Fedwire, the news service of the Federal Reserve.

"The Campaign"This week I was going to announce I was running for Congress. I was taking it very seriously and for the past three months this was the week I was planning on announcing. I had hired people to run the campaign. I had gotten great advice. I had studied the current incumbent in my district. I had spoken to party officials in BOTH parties who were receptive. I had spoken to local reporters who were going to cover it. I was even going through the process of being endorsed by a major national politician. I learned a lot. What I learned convinced me I couldnít run and still be true to my values. The best way to have a difference in the world is to just do what I do now. The best way to clean a dark room is to open the window and let the light in. Thatís what I like to do. But within three seconds of thinking about running for Congress I learned an enormous amount about the bullshit in the system. Below I tell the story of almost instantly being thrown into the machine where I would have to give up my principles. Some of what I learned is below. Some I just have to keep to myself for now. A) †For a mid-term Congressional primary, you will win if you only campaign in nursing homes. Every primary campaign is won by senior citizens as the swing votes. So if you just campaign in nursing homes and make sure that vans are available to get them to vote, then you win. People think that you have to win over young people but in primaries itís the reverse. B) People remember the names of who they donate to. ìThe trick is,î said one experienced marketer, ìis to raise just a dollar from everyone.î The second best thing, he said, ìis to give a dollar to everyoneî. C) I was going to try something creative. Itís easy to get a list of likely voters in your district. I was simply going to buy the vanity searches of all of those people on Google. Since most people search their name, if I blanket their screen (and their Facebook pages) with my name, then they would remember it at voting time. ìWhat we do,î said my favorite marketer (author of the one †million in sales book, ìHow to Run †a Successful Hot Dog Cartî, Perry Belcher), ìis to make the ads really ugly so nobody clicks. So you get the effect you want but it †costs you no moneyî. I bet nobody has thought of this before for a campaign. D) I felt I could win. The incumbent was weak and has already signed up to raise money from PACs that cater to weak incumbents. I also studied his voting record and found weak holes. The bottom line is that a large percentage of the people who have voted for him have lost their jobs and now have worse healthcare. Nor does he actually live in the district. Iíve lived here for most of 11 years. E) Even though Iím pretty apolitical, I felt very strongly about my particular issues. ìBut,î said another marketing expert, ìif you actually say any of this stuff nobody will take your campaign seriously. So you have to rewrite it completely.î I have a 10,000 word platform. I sent it to him. ìyeah,î he said, ìnobody is going to take you seriously and you wonít be able to win.î I agree with him. My feeling is, if I canít run on what I believe in then whatís the point? I had a lot of issues (10,000 words was just the start. I couldíve written a 50,000 word platform) but here are some of my ideas. - Congressmen should NOT be allowed to vote in Washington DC. The only reason they vote there is because there were no phone lines or Internet in 1792. But now Congressmen could stay in their district, help people out, and still engage in debates and learn the issues and vote from home. The benefits: 1. stay closer to constituents and what they want. 2. Most important: it would destroy the hundred billion dollar lobbying/bribery industry. Congressmen basically vote what industry lobbyists want them to vote. Lobbyists have an easy job. All of the Congressmen are located in one small city. Itís easy to wine and dine them ten times a day. If the Congressmen were spread out over the entire country by mandate, then there would be no way to lobby them. End of lobbying industry. More true democracy for voters. In fact, it might even mean the end of Congress, since voters could vote directly and we can have a true democracy instead of a pretend one. - No more ìmilitary actionsî. In the past four years weíve had military actions in at least six different countries and conducted over 20,000 airstrikes, killing many innocent civilians . Iím not sure what good they do. The last LEGALLY declared war was in 1941. Most wars in history have †had an economic cause. If we got creative on the economics, we wouldnít need to send over young 18 year old boys and girls to die pointless deaths that protect nobody. 18 year olds have their senior prom and then they die. Not to mention our lack of nation-building upon completion of a military action. I support the charity ìWomen for Women Internationalî which helps women whose lives and families have been torn apart by military actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, all over Africa, etc. I also support successful technologies that help diagnose returning veterans with post-traumatic stress syndrome as to what medication will most effectively cure their issues. These 18 year old kids are having their lives destroyed. When I ask my 40 year old friends who disagree with me on this issue if they would volunteer for the military in order to relieve an 18 year old, nobody says ìIíll do itî. - Economics stops wars. I †can give 100 examples. But in Rwanda we sent over billions in military aid. None of it worked to prevent genocide in the 90s. Do you know what worked? The price of coffee is perfectly correlated to the genocidal violence in Rwanda. When Starbucks bought coffee from Rwanda: no more genocide (this is overly simplified but actually true). The entire Middle East situation is going to change simply because we have more oil in North Dakota and the Mississippi Lime than the entire Middle East. Letís let that play out in environmentally safe ways now that the technology is finally here and getting better. - Senior citizens are being systematically starved and killed by the government. Social security rises with core inflation, which excludes food and energy increases. Well, food and energy costs have been increasing faster than inflation for many years. So senior citizens get less money each year to cater to their basic needs. And they are living longer. My calculations are they have about ten years before a senior citizen with no other means of support will starve to death. Solution: we have to live up to our promise to people over 65. But anyone younger than 55 should give up their expectations of Social Security (since it wonít help them live anyway). People should keep working. Thereís really no other choice. The retirement age where people get Social Security was set at 65 in a year when the average person died at age 61. Now itís 78. So the world has changed. - Every government asset (State and Federal) should be sold. Why do states own horrible universities, for instance, that rob our children of their youth and put them into horrible debt, and then the Federal government backs that debt. Sell the universities. Sell the highways. Sell the bridges (they are all about to fall apart since the average lifespan of a bridge is about 50 years old and most bridges were built in the 1930s and 40s.) †Sell the poorly run post office. Etc. Iím not suggesting this because the government is horrible at running things. But, yeah, given our debt, I guess they are. So letís run a surplus by simply selling everything, hiring less government employees (who will move over into private industry that buys the assets), and making enough money to pay down debt before inflation starts paying down our debt. Thereís not really any other solution since government is incapable of reducing budgets (we only run surpluses when business is booming). And if companies that buy these assets want to make a profit they wonít let them collapse like the bridge above. A great example of an organization that should be sold off is NASA. A $100 billion budget couldnít get a a commercial vehicle into space but a $10 million X Prize †was able to. Thereís more details here but there is a lot to be learned †from the success of incentives funded by private industry. - Sales tax. No income tax. Letís face it: rich people donít pay income taxes. They never have and they never will. Rich people make money on capital gains which has lower taxes and more loopholes. Itís people who are forced to go to a nine to five job (lower class, middle class, upper middle class) that get screwed on income taxes. People say (because theyíve been trained by their masters) that ìif you replace an income tax with a sales taxî then it becomes a regressive tax against the poor. This is horseshit. The state-sponsored lottery is a tax against the poor. A sales tax punishes people who consume. The last I saw, rich people consume a lot more than poor people and pay no taxes while they do it. You want to keep an income tax †for people making over $200,000 (an arbitrary number that should be modified by state), then fine. But lets get rid of the worst tax and replace it with the one tax that everyone except the fabulously wealthy would be willing to pay. And since the government will own less and operate more efficiently, there will be less need for exorbitant tax revenues to fund military actions and military aid that produces zero results. - No FDA. The FDA approves the drugs you take to live if you have diseases like cancer, etc. It takes almost $2 billion to get a drug past the FDA AFTER the R&amp;D costs that made the drug. And yet, still these †drugs donít work, they cause deaths, and many good drugs are rejected by the FDA for nonsense reasons. I can give examples but suffice to say Iíve seen this 100 times over. And then the problem is: the drugs have to price out of this world ($20,000 a month to take many life-saving cancer drugs) because of the high costs of getting through the FDA. Hence also the enormous lobbying from the pharma industry to make back the costs. At the very least, test for safety, and then pass the drugs. Then the market will decide instead of the lobbyists and well-paid pharma salesmen deciding. Will it result in more deaths from bad drugs? No more than exists now. Will it result in better healthcare? Yes, because drugs will be cheaper and weíll learn a lot more quickly which are the bad ones and which are the good ones. Will the government save money? Yes, because the war on drugs will end. Will it result in more jobs? Yes, because more companies will be able to start actively selling drugs instead of competing with bigger and better capitalized pharma companies. These are just a few of the issues. There are many more. I had issues that nobody would like (stop backing housing mortgages. Stop backing student loans.) This would rein in the cost of houses. †This would rein in the cost of tuitions if colleges could no longer rely on the government to pay their professors/researches salaries. The net result would be that the best scientists would work in private industry instead and young people would have less debt to deal with when starting their career. I would also do a blanket forgiveness of student debt ñ paid for, in part, by states selling off all universities to private industry). I would also change the capital requirements for banks to lend out money, force them to reveal their financial ratings (little known secret: itís actually a Federal felony for a bank employee to actually tell you if itís on the verge of going out of business even if you are about to put all of your money there), and allow banks to refinance your underwater mortgages with current interest rates. And so on. Part I ñ CRAZY Everyone thought I was crazy. And they were right. A marketing expert read my platform and said, ìnobody is going to take you seriously and youíd have to run as an independent and then you would lose.î He was totally right. And why run if I had no chance to win. ìA vanity play,î he called it. Just a waste of money. Part II ñ THE BULLSHIT I began discussions with a major politician who was thinking of endorsing me. He passed me off to a low campaign official. This guy wrote to me and said, ìWe canít back losers. You have to do two things: 1) show us the mathematical path to victory 2) prove that you can raise the money. î And then he said, ominously, ìand then thereís other concerns.î #2 was no problem but #1 I didnít know even what that meant. I had a unique strategy that I felt could win. ìHire our pollster.î So I started talking to the pollster. World famous successful pollster. I didnít know what he was going to do. Nobody knows who I am in my district. Yet. The incumbent didnít even live in the district when he started running here (and still doesnít). The pollster was very nice and we spoke many times. I learned a lot talking to him. But he said, ìwe just need to figure out what your district thinks so you can construct your message in such a way that they vote for you.î I didnít understand. How about I construct my message based on what I think and then they can decide if they like my issues and THEN vote for me? There were other issues. My initial contact even said, ìthere are other factors involved.î I found out the other factor. They wanted to know if I would then support a certain candidate for President. I suddenly felt like I was no longer choosing myself. I was getting anxious about other people choosing/endorsing me and I had to jump through weird hoops I didnít agree with to make it happen. I donít like that in any part of my life. Thatís what my entire book is about.† So I was in politics for basically three seconds and suddenly I was being thrown into a bullshit machine. Part III ñ CLAUDIA Claudia said, ìthis will be stressful and if you win I donít want to live in Washington DC.î ìBut,î I said, ìpart of my platform is that I would never go to DC.î She looked at me. You know the look. The look said, ìstop lying to me.î The look said, ìI am not an idiot. You are going to make me live in DC.î The look said, ìand if you lose youíre going to spend a lot of money for nothing.î ìYou will be a divorced congressmen,î she said, jokingly. But I thought about it. I didnít like that joke. So Iím not running.
No one has hyped the release of Kanye West's latest album, Yeezus, more than Kanye himself. The interviews he's given in anticipation of its official release today read like the rantings of mad man shouting from the rooftops, throwing a tantrum and pounding his fists until everyone shuts up and listens. The album itself is just as strenuous. Yeezus is dark and different, but unlike smooth 808s &amp; Heartbreak, its sound is choppy and industrial. Don't expect Rihanna hooks or sing-alongs, because you'll get none of that. Don't expect this to be a top-down-and-cruising summer album either. Here, melody is not a priority. Yeezus is about Kanye going for your jugular, and at times it works and at times it simply doesn't. Here's where it works:  Here's where it doesn't work:  Another issue with Yeezus is that these hard sounds aren't necessarily backed up by hard (or evolved) lyrics. Yes, Yeezus shows a more sexual, animalistic side of Kanye's personality, but aside from that, he is still talking about the same things ó money, fame, clothes, and women he wants, lost, or can't have ó in basically the same way.  The music is trying really hard to move forward, but the man stays in exactly the same place. Because of that, there are moments in the album where what's being said sounds incredibly silly compared to the hard sounds in the background. It is hard to take Kanye seriously while he's barking out an order for a croissant. For fans of Kanye's older sound, the last song on Yeezus, 'Bound 2' is a thank you card for sticking to the end. It has the slow, soulful wave-your-hands groove of his first three albums. Your grandma would dig it. Kanye was going for something you've never heard before, but different doesn't necessarily mean successful. The best tracks on Yeezus are those that (try to) make peace between the Kanye that was and the Kanye that could be. In that respect Yeezus is a lot like Kanye's fellow Chicago rapper Common's 2002 album, Electric Wire Hustle Flower ó the one that left a lot of die hard Common fans scratching their heads or simply refusing to acknowledge its existence. It was a departure from what they understood as his sound, an envelope pushing hip-hop album, but like on Yeezus, the best songs are the ones that sound most effortless. Being an 'innovator' means that Kanye constantly has to stay ahead of the curve, an exhausting job. Unfortunately for Mr. West, in the case of Yeezus he's mostly running on a treadmill, soaked in sweat, chugging on electrolite riddled sport drink as he tries to catch up to the man he wants to be.†
Private jet charter company VistaJet has placed an order for 40 Bombardier planes, it announced this morning at the Paris Air Show. The transaction consists of 20 firm orders and 20 options for the Challenger 350, a super midsize jet that can fly eight passengers more than¬†3,600 miles on a full tank.¬† VistaJet buys its own planes and offers seats to its customers for hourly rates, then sells the jets before their warranties are up. The Challenger order comes on the heels of a much larger purchase in November, when VistaJet placed a firm demand for 56 Bombardier Global jets, worth $3.1 billion. That was the largest single transaction in business aviation history.¬† Of the 20 (or 40) new Challengers, 40% will be used to replace older jets VistaJet plans to sell. The rest represent a growth of its fleet, which is currently at 37 planes. Business is very good for VistaJet,¬†founder and chairman Thomas Flohr said in an interview in Paris today. The private jet market has been weak since 2008, but the fact that fewer people are buying their own planes works to VistaJet's advantage.¬† "A lot of people learned the lesson that owning is an airplane is not like owning a car," Flohr said. For people who fly under 500 hours a year, "it makes absolutely no financial sense to own an airplane." That kind of traveler is the ideal VistaJet client. The company¬†does not disclose many price figures, but a representative told us, "A flight between London and Moscow is roughly equivalent to burning through four Hermes handbags." According to the Wall Street Journal, a flight costs $15,000 per hour. The interiors of the VistaJet Challenger 350s will be modeled after the company's Global jets, on a smaller scale. There is a jump seat for the Cabin Hostess, so passengers can enjoy privacy, and the jets will be equipped with Wi-Fi.
en.wikipedia.orgMany have been skeptical of the true extent of the shale revolution's impact on the U.S. economy, beyond localized effects like lowering mid-continent crude prices and reducing costs for industrial petroleum product manufacturing. But in a new note, Standard and Poor RatingsDirect's Peter Rigby says it's actually given the U.S. a tremendous amount of political leverage. Specifically, it can impose sanctions on Iran without the ricochet effect of spiking crude oil prices.† The Boston Company has made a similar argument ó that U.S. crude production may not be causing prices to go down, but has dampened market volatility.† In a follow-up email to Business Insider, Rigby elaborated on his point:† ...as Iranian supply came off the global market, new US supply was coming on line to contribute to meeting global demand.  So even though US supply, for all practical purposes, does not go onto the global market, it contributes to global supplies. The price is still global, which the US pays, adjusted, of course, for transportation and crude quality differentials.  So, all else being equal, had the embargo gone into effect without that new 1 million barrels per day from the US, there would have been upwards price pressure on crude.  One million barrels is not an insignificant amount, as evidenced by the changing crude oil shipping patterns that are emerging.  Rigby cautioned that the Saudis still hold all the cards. But it looks like the U.S. is finally getting some leverage.
Hereís why Oliver thinks there is a risk of recession: ìEssentially, itís argued that Australia has been propped up by a huge mining boom which boosted national income and in turn underwrote a boom in residential property prices. With the mining boom fading, itís argued the economy will collapse and unemployment will surge triggering a sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and a collapse in house prices, ultimately leading to huge problems for the banks.î And hereís why he thinks a recession may be avoided: ìThere is still plenty of scope for lower interest rates and a lower $A to boost the economy Ö Just as high interest rates and a high $A put many non-mining sectors of the economy into hibernation over the last few years to make way for the mining boom, this will now go in reverse allowing the pressure to come off these sectors and the economy to return to more balanced growth in 2014, led by the laggards of the last few years such as housing, retailing and domestic tourism.î Oliver expects the Aussie dollar to fall to about $US0.80 ìover the next few yearsî, as the RBA attempts to offset relatively high prices and costs and boost manufacturing, domestic tourism, agriculture and mining industries. Investors should favour Australian bonds over global bonds and expect unhedged global shares to outperform Australian shares, he says. Bank term deposit rates are expected to fall further to below 4%. Treasurer Wayne Swan has cried foul over media reporting of Australiaís recession risk, arguing in a lengthy article last week that trashing confidence in the economy was reckless and not in Australiaís national interest. Goldman Sachs last week put Australiaís risk of recession at 20% but said a recession would likely be avoided with better global growth, domestic policy stimulus and a lower Australian dollar. And Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Saul Eslake this week has a research note putting Australiaís risk of recession at about 25%, with real GDP growth slowing from about 2.75% this year and next to 1% in 2015 and -0.1% in 2016, and unemployment reaching 7.5% in mid-2016. On the flip side, Eslake says thereís a 75% chance of real GDP growth reaching just under 2% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016, with unemployment peaking at 6.75% in early 2016.

No doubt GDP growth and other measures of economic output are favorable in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China and India) countries than in the developed world. Frontier markets (for those who find mere Emerging Markets boring) are more loosely defined but include Argentina, Bangladesh and Croatia. Of course not every country gets promoted. The implicit promise is that an Emerging country will eventually emerge into the warm sunshine of the developed world. Sadly for Greece, they were recently relegated from developed and back to emerging by MSCI. The faster growth enjoyed by these more dynamic economies doesnít necessarily translate into superior returns for investors. Chinaís growth has moderated in recent quarters, but the central planners are still targeting 7% annual increases in GDP, around three times the sustainable rate in the U.S. However, investors in the iShares†FTSE†China 25 Index Fund (FXI) have since the end of 2007 endured an annualized return of -6.4% whereas over the same period the S&amp;P 500 has returned +4.2%.†The mechanism that translates†increased GDP†into investor profits isnít that reliable in China. And why should this be surprising? Public policy objectives regard both real and intellectual property rights as subservient to government policy. Fair treatment of investors is a fairly low priority. John Paulson lost an estimated $500 million in his hedge funds through an investment in Sino Forest, a†Chinese lumber company that on closer inspection appeared to be†harvesting trees on property it did not own.†Running a Ponzi scheme such as this one doesnít draw the same†ire of securities regulators that we see in the U.S. Several years ago on a trip to India I found myself in a conversation with a senior member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Indiaís securities regulator. ìApproximately how many insider trading cases are prosecuting annually in India?î I inquired of a man closely involved in maintaining the integrity of Indiaís capital markets. ìOh none ñ there is no insider trading in India.î was his breezy response. Intrepid buyers of securities in countries where †substantial segments of the population struggle with basic issues of human survival should leave their pre-conceived ideas of fair markets behind. That doesnít mean you shouldnít invest in emerging markets ñ that is, after all, where the growth is. But itís far more sensible to do so through large multi-national corporations who are infinitely more able to assess†each opportunity, control their risk and wind up with a fair return.†P&amp;G (PG) is heavily focused on growing its already†substantial sales in developing markets (currently $33-34 billion). Mondelez (MDLZ) reports that 40% of its sales are in emerging markets. IBM (IBM) is targeting 30% of its sales in Growth markets by 2015. We are invested in these companies and others like them, because their brands of products and services continue to have globally attractive growth prospects. Investors can obtain exposure to the faster growth of the developing world through companies whose brands are sought throughout the world. In addition, theyíll be protected by U.S. standards of governance and accounting. It turns out that you donít need to go abroad to invest there. Although we donít invest directly in emerging markets, we profit from their growth through the expertise of global companies like these and others that do business there. Why do it any other way?

AFPNigella Lawson, celebrity chef and wife of art collector and advertising mogul Charles Saatchi.British art collector Charles Saatchi has accepted a police caution for assault following an incident with his wife, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, outside a London restaurant. The Sunday People tabloid showed pictures of Saatchi, a wealthy 70-year-old former advertising executive, with his hand around Lawson's neck as they sat at a table outside a seafood restaurant. The publicity-shy art collector, who owns London's Saatchi Gallery, agreed to accept a police caution on Monday, according to media reports Tuesday. "A 70-year-old man voluntarily attended a central London police station and accepted a caution for assault," London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement. It said officers were aware of the Sunday People article "and carried out an investigation". Cautions are handed to adults who admit a minor offence and can be used as evidence of bad character in court. A suspect who does not accept a caution may be arrested and charged. They are not criminal convictions. Saatchi told the London Evening Standard newspaper: "We were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella's neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasise my point. "There was no grip, it was a playful tiff." He said they had patched things up by the time they got home. He said he had told his wife, a daughter of 1980s British finance minister Nigel Lawson, to leave their home with her two children until the "dust settled". Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved.

And ‚Äúshades of that,‚Äù as Haldane put it with classic British humor, namely understatement, are visible everywhere. Ten-year Treasury notes have been kicked down from their historic pedestal last July when some poor souls, blinded by the Fed‚Äôs halo of omnipotence and benevolence, bought them at a minuscule yield of 1.3%. For them, it‚Äôs been an ice-cold shower ever since. As Treasuries dropped, yields meandered upward in fits and starts. After a five-week jump from 1.88% in early May, they hit 2.29% on Tuesday last week ‚Äì they‚Äôve retreated to 2.19% since then. Now investors are wondering out loud what would happen if ten-year Treasury yields were to return to more normal levels of 4% or even 5%, dragging other long-term interest rates with them. They know what would happen: carnage! Wholesale dumping of Treasuries by exasperated foreigners has already commenced. Private foreigners dumped $30.8 billion in Treasuries in April, an all-time record. Official holders got rid of $23.7 billion in long-term Treasury debt, the highest since November 2008, and $30.1 billion in short-term debt. Sell, sell, sell! Bond fund redemptions spoke of fear and loathing: in the week ended June 12, investors yanked $14.5 billion out of Treasury bond funds, the second highest ever, beating the prior second-highest-ever outflow of $12.5 billion of the week before. They were inferior only to the October 2008 massacre as chaos descended upon financial markets. $27 billion in two weeks! In lockstep, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates jumped from 3.59% in early May to 4.15% last week. The mortgage refinancing bubble, by which banks have creamed off billions in fees, is imploding ‚Äì the index has plunged 36% since early May. But home prices have risen as private-equity funds and investors have gobbled up single-family homes, hoping that they could rent them out [which turned out to be difficult ... here‚Äôs my take: Housing Bubble II: But This Time It‚Äôs¬†Different]. These inflated prices are now colliding with rising mortgage rates ‚Äì and with the possibility that hot money might dump empty homes while it still can. Which would make for one heck of an ugly dynamic. In low quality debt, the carnage has been particularly nasty ‚Äì though it‚Äôs just the beginning. Frantic investors went to chase after yield that the Fed, in its infinite wisdom, had deprived them of elsewhere, and they sank their teeth into junk bonds, and overpaid for them in an epic feeding frenzy, and drove yields down to ridiculous lows, below 5% for some, though these bonds promised a relatively high probability of default and loss of principal to their hapless holders. The absurd magnitude of the bubble was so glaring that even Fed officials who caused it began to get concerned, in part because financial institutions were loading up on junk. But on May 9, the party stopped, and the gnashing of teeth started. Junk bonds plunged and yields skyrocketed, with the BofA Merrill Lynch High-Yield index jumping from 5.24% to 6.44% by Friday [my take on how much more damage might be in store for them.... The Day The Big Fat Junk-Bond Bubble Blew¬†Up] Emerging-market debt got slaughtered as well, particularly dollar and euro bonds issued by companies that do their business and earn their profits, if any, in now plunging local currencies that once had been hyped as a sure bet against the dollar. Hype dies quickly. Now these companies face the insurmountable task of having to spend ever more of their weakening local currency to service their debts. There will be defaults. Billions will go up in smoke. In anticipation, these now crappy but previously wondrous bonds have taken a hard beating of almost 8% in five weeks. Emerging-market bond funds were hit by $9 billion in redemptions last week, the third largest ever. And it too is just the beginning. All because of a single word. To its immense credit, the Fed, with its money-printing and bond-buying binge that is continuing at $85 billion a month, has accomplished a unique feat: shifting the focus of financial markets away from awkward economic and business fundamentals to what the Fed will do next. It worked like a charm for years. But now, what the Fed will do next has been boiled down to a single innocuous-sounding word: ‚Äútaper.‚Äù The mere possibility that the Fed might ‚Äútaper‚Äù its binge has pricked the most insane credit bubble mankind has ever seen. A ‚Äúdisorderly‚Äù implosion could take down some big banks, and as Haldane put it, pose the ‚Äúbiggest risk to global financial stability.‚Äù So the Fed is now trying to figure out how to exit from its reckless experiment without taking down any banks; more TBTF bank bailouts would be embarrassing. Investors have taken note. Seatbelts are being fastened, and the clicks can be heard around the world. While the S&amp;P 500 has continued moving higher, with investor sentiment in America cautiously bullish, over the past month, there has been a huge increase in volatility; and emerging markets have been hit with big losses.

In 2006 ten Playboy Playmates were asked to make stock picks. Half the Playmates beat the S&amp;P 500 while less than a third of professional money managers were able to. Via¬†The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing: In 2006, Tradingmarkets, a company that helps people trade stocks, asked ten Playboy Playmates to select five stocks each. The idea was to see if they could beat the market. The winner was Deanna Brooks, Playmate of the Month in May 1998. The stocks she picked rose 43.4 percent, trouncing the S&amp; P 500, which gained 13.6 percent, and beating more than 90 percent of the money managers who actively try to outperform a given index. Brooks wasn‚Äôt the only one who fared well. Four of the other ten Playmates had better returns than the S&amp; P 500 while less than a third of the active money managers did. How? The answer is easy ‚Äî unlike more skill-based activities, a great deal of picking stocks is about luck. And therein lies a mistake we‚Äôre all prone to. As Michael Mauboussin explains in his fascinating new book,¬†The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing¬†we are often terrible about distinguishing when challenges are about skill and when they‚Äôre about luck, leading us to make less accurate predictions. First, look at the event you‚Äôre trying to predict and take the time to think about how much skill is involved vs luck. This will determine what evidence you should focus on. Via¬†The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing: When we make predictions, we often fail to recognize the existence of luck, and as a consequence we dwell too much on the specific evidence, especially recent evidence. This also makes it tougher to judge performance. Once something has happened, our natural inclination is to come up with a cause to explain the effect. The problem is that we commonly twist, distort, or ignore the role that luck plays in our successes and failures. Thinking explicitly about how luck influences our lives can help offset that cognitive bias. Whether skill or luck is more central will determine whether you should lean on general statistics, or whether you should strongly consider the specifics of this particular event.

Tom StillwellThe talented Mr. Stillwell.A British man who miraculously survived a fall from a 15th-storey balcony in New Zealand while drunkenly trying to break into his apartment has labelled himself an "idiot". Tom Stilwell, 20, plummeted from the balcony in his Auckland apartment block in the early hours of Sunday morning, suffering broken bones and cuts but leaving experts amazed that he was still alive. Stilwell had arrived home to find himself locked out of his 14th-storey apartment and decided to try to clamber down to his balcony from a neighbour's property one floor above. Instead he slipped as the horrified neighbour looked on, plunging 13 floors before an adjacent roof broke his fall. Stilwell's flatmate Dave Thomas said the 20-year-old from Brighton, who is in New Zealand on a working holiday, was unable to talk when he awoke at Auckland Central Hospital because he had tubes down his throat. "After a nurse explained to him about what had happened, he wrote on his little squiggly board 'what an idiot'," Thomas told the New Zealand Herald. He said Stilwell was now "back to his old jokey self" but could remember nothing about his escapade. The hospital said Stilwell had been moved out of its intensive care ward and was expected to make a full recovery. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
Mary ToddThe family of an American scientist found hanged in Singapore last year dismissed on Tuesday the city-state's findings that he committed suicide as "a sham and a cover-up" for a murder. "I am not surprised by the state's findings because the state refused to consider murder, they only investigated suicide," Mary Todd, mother of the late electronics engineer Shane Todd, told AFP by email from the United States. The Singapore government, summing up its position after two weeks of public hearings in May, on Monday rejected the family's conspiracy theory, saying Todd killed himself in June 2012 in his own apartment after a bout of depression. "If they had nothing to hide, they would not care one way or the other what happened to Shane. Sadly, the inquest was never an open, non-adversarial, fact-finding inquiry as promised but was a sham and a cover-up," the mother said. The government's findings were presented to an independent coroner, whose verdict on the cause of death is scheduled to be handed down on July 8. Todd's family stormed out of the hearings on May 21, saying they had "lost faith" in the proceedings. But their chief Singaporean lawyer said the family was still considering whether to file a formal summary of its position to the coroner, whose verdict cannot be appealed against. In her message to AFP, Mary Todd repeated claims that her son's former employer, Singapore's state-linked Institute of Microelectronics (IME), was more closely involved with China's Huawei Technologies than stated at the hearings. In earlier statements to the inquest, Todd's parents said that before he died, the researcher expressed fears that he was being made to compromise US national security in a secret project involving the two companies. IME and Huawei say they only held preliminary talks on a potential commercial venture and reject the family's allegations they worked on a clandestine project involving Todd with military applications. A US congressional committee last year labelled Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom firm, as potential security threats that should be excluded from US government contracts and barred from acquiring US firms. During the hearings, the Todd family's star witness, US pathologist Edward Adelstein, recanted an earlier theory that Todd was garroted with a cord in his own apartment. AFPRick Todd and his wife Mary, pictured at the Subordinate courts in Singapore, on May 21, 2013. The family of an American scientist found hanged in Singapore last year dismissed on Tuesday the city-state's findings that he committed suicide as "a sham and a cover-up" for a murder.He presented a new theory: Todd was killed by assassins who used a stun gun before choking his neck and then hanging him to make it look like a suicide. But Adelstein presented no evidence and two other US pathologists testified in support of Singapore police findings that Todd hanged himself from his bathroom door. On Monday, lawyers for the Singapore government cited suicide notes left by Todd on his laptop computer, a psychiatrist's testimony that he suffered from depression, and a browsing history showing he accessed suicide websites. They said the scientist's depression had likely worsened in the months before his death because he did not complete a prescribed course of anti-depressants or schedule follow-up appointments with his psychiatrist.

AFPChinese telecoms giant Huawei will launch a new smartphone on Tuesday to better compete with high-end rivals like Apple and Samsung overseas, a company official said. Huawei will unveil the Ascend P6 in London in one of its major smartphone launches of the year, Huawei spokesman Roland Sladek told AFP. The move is "significant" because it marks a global launch held outside Huawei's home base of China and will be a stand-alone event, unlike previous launches at industry trade shows, he said. The venue for the launch is London's Roundhouse, Dow Jones Newswires reported, a legendary cultural venue which has previously hosted shows by rock icons such as Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd. "It's a very well-designed, very appealing phone -- one of the thinnest phones in the world," Sladek said. "It's certainly competing with Apple but beyond that it's really looking for an audience who look for a piece of modern fashion," he said. Starting as a provider of telecom network equipment, Huawei has sought to make inroads into mobile devices by selling smartphones under its own brand over the past three years. The company, founded by a former engineer in the Chinese army, has also found controversy overseas for its traditional line of business. The US Congress last year warned network equipment supplied by Huawei could be used for spying and called for its exclusion from government contracts and acquisitions. Huawei has denied those claims and accused the US government of protectionism. In China's highly competitive smartphone segment, Huawei held a 10.1 percent share in the first quarter of this year, higher than Apple's 6.4 percent, according to consultancy Analysys International. South Korea's Samsung was the market leader for smartphones in China with 17.3 percent for the period, its data showed. "The handset products Huawei launched before were relatively low-end and low-priced," said Wang Jun of Analysys International. "The launch of this higher quality handset is related to Huawei's own strategy of product excellence," he said. "The value of its brand was not well reflected before, when it used low-priced products to grab market share." Although a major vendor in China and some other international markets, Huawei has limited smartphone sales in the United States, where it launched a phone using Microsoft's Windows Phone platform. Huawei has a reputation for secrecy which the company has tried to shed after US claims it was a security threat. Company founder Ren Zhengfei gave his first media briefing outside China by speaking to journalists in New Zealand in May. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
Julia La Roche, Business Insider(Reuters) - Over the past few years, Citigroup Inc has been grappling with an unusual problem - how to incur more U.S. taxes. The third-largest U.S. bank tried to buy the foundering Wachovia Corp in the fall of 2008 in part because the deal would have brought it more taxable domestic income, a person familiar with the matter said. In February this year, it agreed to buy a portfolio of about $7 billion in credit card loans to Best Buy Co Inc customers from Capital One Financial Corp - and taxes played a role in the bank's decision to do the deal, Chief Executive Michael Corbat said in March. Citigroup is even reclassifying overseas profit as money that it might bring back to the United States, an odd move in an era in which many American companies try to keep much of their foreign income abroad to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes on the profits. The bank is not feeling generous ‚Äî it is just looking to use up $55 billion of tax credits and deductions, known as deferred tax assets, as of the end of March. It had accumulated them from losses and foreign tax payments largely during and after the financial crisis. About 95 percent of these future tax benefits are in the United States. Realizing these benefits over time could be worth some $27 billion to Citigroup today, or about $9 per share for a stock that trades at around $50 a share, according to John McDonald, a veteran bank analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Using all these assets will free up more than $40 billion, about one-third, of the bank's capital. Citigroup could then return more capital to shareholders through stock-boosting moves like share buybacks. Deferred tax assets arise because U.S. companies have to keep two sets of books - one for the financial markets, and a second for the Internal Revenue Service. The bank recognizes items including costs, such as expected losses on loans, at different times on the two books. A cost that is on a bank's books for investors, but will not be recognized for tax purposes until later, generates a deferred tax asset. Regulators force banks to use more capital to support these assets, because there is often doubt over whether the assets will be fully realized. Converting these expected future tax benefits into cash will not be easy for Citigroup. Doubts about the bank's ability to realize its deferred tax assets are baked into its share price, investors said. Even as the bank in recent years has been consuming deferred tax assets (DTA), it has been creating new ones through expenses like mortgage litigation settlements. The bank's deferred tax assets actually grew by about $3.8 billion in 2012. "One of my top priorities is to turn that trend around," said Citigroup CEO Corbat at the bank's annual meeting in April. The bank estimates it needs to earn as much as $112 billion in U.S. taxable income to use all of its deferred tax assets. About $22 billion of the assets must be used within 10 years, but many of the other deferred tax assets will not expire. Buying U.S. assets would be one way to boost its U.S. taxable income. Like any company, Citigroup primarily looks for deals that make strategic and economic sense, but within that framework it is also on the lookout for transactions that will help it use deferred tax assets. "We are focused on executing our strategy and any allocation of resources must be in line with that strategy," Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio said in a statement. "If those actions also result in aiding the use of our DTA then that is an added benefit." CRISIS HANGOVER Other U.S. financial companies have big deferred tax assets as well because of the impact of the financial crisis. Bank of America Corp, for example, has $33 billion of the assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities. But Bank of America has much larger U.S. operations than Citigroup, which makes it easier for it to use these benefits. For Citigroup, the two most important sources of U.S. taxable income are the credit card business and the investment banking business, in particular corporate bond underwriting and trading and interest-rate trading, said the person familiar with the matter who is not authorized to speak for attribution. The recent selloff in bonds might help bond trading revenue, because market shifts often spur more trading volume. If the U.S. economic recovery continues, the bank's credit card revenue could grow, too. The improving housing market will also help the bank use or reverse deferred tax assets linked to mortgages. Some critics who had argued in the past that the bank would have to write down some of the deferred tax assets, because of questions about its ability to earn enough taxable income, said that is less likely now. "We're no longer in the throes of an economic crisis, and it would be shocking to me if they wrote them down at this stage," said Robert Willens, an accounting analyst who had previously worked for Lehman Brothers. In 2009, Willens said the bank would likely have to write down its deferred tax assets.

Last night, Brazil had its largest protest in 20 years. We posted pictures from the protests (which have various economic causes, including a recent decision to hike bus fare), but from a typical ground shot it can be hard to grasp just how large the turnout was. However, a 6-second video from a building really captures how epic the event was. Via Smackson on Reddit, check out this Vine showing the gigantic protester throng. 
Riots have broken out in Brazil. Notionally they have to do with an increase in bus fares, but they have to do with bigger issues related to inequality, and how much the government is spending on things like hosting the World Cup. The Brazilian economy is not well. All you have to do is look at a chart of the Brazilian stock market (the Bovespa) and see what a horrendous year it's had. It literally had its year peak on the first day of trading, and since then has fallen about 20%. From Bloomberg  What's going wrong in Brazil? Basically inflation is still sky high, growth is slowing, employment is sputtering, and the country's' Balance of Payments is deteriorating, which is eating into its foreign exchange reserves, imperiling the Brazilian Real (the currency) which like other emerging market currencies has done badly. In a note that came out yesterday, Barclays predicted a Brazilian sovereign downgrade in early 2014. From the note: Brazilian policymakers have changed gears again this year. The backdrop is set by an economic recovery that is not taking off and inflation that remains high. The trade-off between inflation and activity has been deteriorating since 2010, but now the problem is that high inflation is beginning to erode real wages and is taking a larger-than-expected toll on consumption. Even if presidential elections are still 16 months away, politics is gradually taking centre stage. And in our view, it is the fear that the erosion of real income will continue to dampen President Dilma‚Äôs popularity (between March and May, it fell 8pp, to a still-high 57%, according to Datafolha) ahead of the 2014 presidential elections that elevated controlling inflation to the government‚Äôs top priority.

There's a Warren Buffett quote that's something akin to: When the tide goes out, you can see who's been swimming naked. That's the theme of a note this morning from SocGen analyst Kit Juckes, who says that as rates are rising, and tapering talk picks up, it's beginning to be clear where the unsustainable bubbles have been built up. No surprise: He says the bubbles were found in emerging markets, which have been crumbling lately. Each of the three significant financial bubbles of the last 30 years has been fuelled by the Fed keeping policy rates below the nominal growth rate of the economy for far too long. The chart below highlights two conflicting issues... one supporting my core view, the other challenging it. The first is that current policy is creating market and economic distortions just as past periods did. The reaction to taper talk in EM, commodities and volatility shows where bubbles have been inflated. This is the most powerful argument in favour of the Fed taking the first baby-steps on the path away from super-easy policy. The second issue is that nominal GDP growth is slowing - 3.4% y/y in Q1 2013 after a post-crisis peak at 4.5% a year ago. SG economic forecasts look for a re-acceleration from here. The Fed may not need evidence of a return to ‚Äòold normal' growth or signs of a re-acceleration in CPI or wage inflation to justify tapering. But nominal growth does need to turn a bit higher. It's possible that Juckes is being dramatic with the "bubble to end bubbles" line, but the volatility being seen in emerging markets right now (from Indonesia to Brazil) lends a datapoint in favor of the idea that that's where this period's big bubble was blown.  Meanwhile, the burgeoning economic worries in Brazil have resulted in some extraordinary protests, the largest in 20 years, ostensibly due to an increase in bus fares. 
‚Äè@SKiL136Tomorrow is the big day, when we might get clues about whether the Fed will begin to pull back a bit on monetary easing. Today is the calm before the storm, and it's pretty quiet. Futures are up in the US and markets are higher in Europe. Japan ended down merely 0.2%, which is super-quiet. China gained 0.4%. Today we get CPI and housing starts. Both should be interesting, especially CPI given the disinflation trend.
