REUTERS/Yuya Shino " border="0">Thomson ReutersA Skymark Airlines Inc's airplane is parked at Haneda airport in TokyoTOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Japan's Skymark Airlines Inc jumped 28 percent on Tuesday after the Nikkei business daily reported that Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd is in talks with financial institutions on a possible tender offer for the struggling carrier. Skymark last month warned of uncertainty about its ability to stay in business if it had to pay penalties to Airbus for the failing to follow through on an order for six A380 superjumbos. It had been unable to get financing for the deal. Skymark said Airbus was demanding "an extraordinary amount of compensation" for the cancellation. Skymark's shares were up by their daily limit of 50 yen at 230 yen in early trade in Tokyo, compared with a five-year low of 153 yen set last week. Skymark had yet to release a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange in response to the report. In a post on its website, the bourse cautioned the company for lack of information. Representatives for Skymark and AirAsia were not immediately available for comment. AirAsia, one of the most aggressive budget airlines in Asia, last month said it would set up a low-cost airline with Japan's biggest online retailer Rakuten Inc and other firms, marking its second attempt to tap the Japanese market. Skymark last month also reported a sharply wider loss and said it would take steps to improve its financial situation, including exiting unprofitable routes and borrowing from financial institutions.   (Reporting by Chris Gallagher in Tokyo and Yantoultra Ngui in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Edwina Gibbs) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Michaela RehleCentral banks purchased 118 tonnes in net gold in Q2 2014, representing a 28% year-over-year increase, according to The World Gold Council. In May 2014, the European Central Bank and other European central banks signed the fourth Central Bank Gold Agreement (CBGA). The agreement says the central banks "currently do not have plans to sell significant amounts of gold," and that it will last for five years starting in the end of September 2014. Country-wise, Russia saw a major increase in official reserves since February 2014, moving its place up two spots in the ranking.  Global official gold holdings totaled 31,812 tonnes as of August 2014, according to the latest report from the World Gold Council. Business Insider identified the 10 countries with the largest gold reserves. Note: CBGA refers to the Central Bank Gold Agreements. The first Agreement (CBGA 1) ran from Sept. 27, 1999, to Sept. 26, 2004. The second Agreement (CBGA 2) ran from Sept. 27, 2004, to Sept. 26, 2009. The third Agreement (CBGA 3) will run for five years from September 2009. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/China DailyFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  Now Is A Good Time For Investors To Look At The Rate Sensitivity In Their Portfolios (AllianceBernstein Blog)  "Though they’ve defied expectations this year, higher interest rates appear to be all but inevitable," writes Chris Marx at AllianceBernstein Blog. "Investors need to take measure of the rate sensitivity in their portfolios—and stay agile—to negotiate the rough market crosscurrents a rate reversal may bring." While stocks typically do well in an environment when rates rise and the economy strengthens, stocks in "some “safer” (income-oriented) industries, such as utilities, tobacco, telecom and real estate investment trusts, are the most obviously vulnerable," Marx writes. "Their dividends will look less appealing as the yields on less volatile fixed-income alternatives climb." Housing related stocks could also be hit.  "On the other side of the ledger, a rotation out of defensives would likely favor cheaper, more cyclically sensitive stocks in materials, energy and consumer discretionary industries. But positive rate sensitivity lurks in many other corners as well.  Financial stocks are an obvious example. Banks typically see a nice boost in their net interest margins if long-term rates rise faster than short-term rates (as is typical in an economic recovery)." Jim Chanos Blows Up The 2 Most Commonly Cited Arguments Against Short-Selling (Bloomberg Radio)  Jim Chanos, director of Kynikos Associates shot down two short-selling truisms in a Bloomberg Radio interview with Barry Ritholtz. First, he rejected the idea that you can make a maximum of 100% by shorting a stock. "If you start with a short position at $100 with no other cash in your account, and you short the stock and it goes down to $50, you can, without adding any more cash capital to the account, short additional shares," he said. "And if it keeps going your way, you can compound your return." Chanos also dismissed the argument that short-sellers face infinite losses. He pointed out that they can put in stop-losses or automatic price levels to cover the short.  "These are examples of thinking that that are accurate on their face, but in practicality they're inaccurate," Chanos said. "Because you structure things to not let that happen and you can actually get protection through the structure of the investment vehicle to obviate those risks. But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance." Why Advisors Need To Hire Interns (The Wall Street Journal)  Sabrina Lowell, COO of Mosaic Financial Partners thinks advisors should hire interns to handle time consuming quantitative tasks. "For doing things like sending out and proofreading questionnaires, and inputting financial data into our system, interns are perfect," she writes in a WSJ column. "...Other process-driven tasks that interns perform well include keeping clients' beneficiary designations up-to-date; researching the stock plans of publicly traded companies in search of new clients who could benefit from stock-option planning; and identifying clients' deposit habits. These are fundamental planning practices that tend to fall to the bottom of the pile." FLECKENSTEIN: There’s 'No Chance' That This Ends Well (King World News)  Bill Fleckenstein, President of Fleckenstein Capital, told King World News that he anticipated big problems for stocks and bonds down the road. "There’s no chance that the outcome in the financial markets in America is a pleasant one because we’ve gotten here because of the printed money," Fleckenstein said. "And so either we have a boatload of inflation and at some point the bond market really gets wrecked and the Fed’s credibility is undermined and we do something about them…" "This can’t possibly end well. This has gone on for so long. It’s still not possible to say when it’s going to change and what’s going to be the catalyst. The important thing to understand is that this is a very fragile structure. The market is very crash-prone. There’s not going to be any liquidity on the downside because of what’s happened in the banks — the algorithms and all that other stuff." FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTaxi drives past Standard Chartered's main branch in Hong KongNEW YORK (Reuters) - Standard Chartered Plc is close to a deal to pay between $200 million and $300 million to resolve allegations by New York’s banking regulator that it failed to review high-risk transactions, two years after agreeing to reform its practices, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The announcement of the settlement could come this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak about the talks and declined to be identified. The penalty would be the second the British bank has paid to the New York Department of Financial Services in two years. In August 2012, Standard Chartered agreed to a $340 million settlement over allegations that it stripped identifying information from transactions linked to Iran, making it impossible for U.S. banks to detect them. A person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that a compliance monitor installed as part of the 2012 deal detected the latest problem. It is unclear precisely what transactions are at issue in the current probe. A Standard Chartered spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   (Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Writing by Joseph Ax. Editing by Andre Grenon) FREE AppDownload
REUTERSWhile stocks retreated on Friday, following a confrontation on the Ukrainian border, equities pushed ahead last week. Part of the advance can be attributed to a perception, at least until Friday, that geopolitical risks in the Ukraine and Middle East were abating. However, as I write in my new weekly commentary, “Where There is Value, There Are Investors,” last week’s market performance also proved that investors are having a hard time kicking a certain habit: treating bad news as good. As the Federal Reserve (Fed) rolled out its easy money policy in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, investors became accustomed to treating weaker-than-expected economic news as a positive sign that the Fed would soon step in with more monetary stimulus. But while the Fed plans to wind down its quantitative easing program by this October and most market watchers expect a Fed rate increase sometime during the first half of 2015, many investors still appear to be holding out hope for an even longer period of monetary accommodation, and such hopes largely drove last week’s advance. Investors bid up stocks on the back of generally weak economic data, including another soft U.S. retail sales number, stagnating growth in the eurozone and slowing loan growth in China. For example, U.S. stocks rose sharply on Wednesday as investors interpreted weak U.S. retail sales as reducing the odds of an early Fed hike. The common theme in all of these instances was optimism for either more aggressive monetary and/or fiscal stimulus, or, at the very least, a continuation of already easy monetary policy. In my opinion, however, a change in the Fed’s intended monetary policy is unlikely, at least based on recent economic reports. While the U.S. economy does have persistent pockets of softness (such as household spending) and does face significant headwinds (like slow wage growth), it is generally improving. Though the U.S. economic recovery is certainly uneven, when you look at recent economic data overall, it’s evident that the recovery is gaining steam and that the U.S. economy has fully recovered from the first quarter’s economic contraction. Looking forward, I see the U.S. economy growing at around 2% this year, consistent with the post-crisis average since the United States came out of the recession in the third quarter of 2009, but with a decidedly stronger second half. For the Fed to step in with a longer-than-expected continuation, or even an increase, in monetary stimulus, we’d need to see a clear trend of weaker-than-expected data rather than the mixed, but still generally positive, economic reports dominating headlines today. Plus, rates have been grinding lower lately without any help from the Fed, thanks partly to softness in other countries. Persistent economic weakness and the lingering threat of deflation have pushed down European bond yields. German Bund yields traded below 1% last week, an all-time low. To the extent that lower European yields make the United States more attractive by comparison, Europe’s slowdown is contributing to the persistence of low rates in the United States. In turn, low rates are helping to support stocks, as investors have little choice but to search for return, and even income, in other asset classes. So, rather than continue to hope for an unlikely sea change in Fed policy, investors would do better to focus on relative valuation, which has become a key differentiator of performance lately. Despite lingering economic headwinds, market segments with relatively cheap valuations have been attracting buyers, a trend I expect to continue. FREE AppDownload
Getty Images Entertainment/ Rob KimJordan Belfort at the premiere of "The Wolf Of Wall Street."Jordan Belfort — the real life stockbroker and scam artist who inspired "The Wolf of Wall Street" — is teaming up with "Rush Hour" director Brett Ratner and Australian billionaire James Packer to produce and write a “Mad Men”-style TV show about the excess of Wall Street in the 1980s.  Basically, "The Wolf of Wall Street" the TV show. “The idea was to come up with a show about that period with really interesting characters, and so my manager pitched the idea to Brett Ratner, who fell in love with it,” Belfort explained to the Weekend Australian in a new interview. AP Photo/Matt SaylesDirector Brett Ratner will produce the Jordan Belfort-inspired show through his joint production company, RatPac-Dune Entertainment. Packer says of the future series: "I respect Jordan for his perseverance. Like many others, he is a man that made a lot of mistakes but he isn't hiding. Jordan worked hard to build his new career and this adventure is an important part of his journey." Belfort, who will co-write the series, will produce the show alongside Ratner, Packer, and Wall Street financier Steven Mnuchin’s production company, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, reports PageSix. In September, Ratner's RatPac-Dune closed a $450 million financing deal with Warner Bros. to fund up to 75 upcoming films. "Gravity” was the first title covered by the new, four-year partnership — which pocketed the company a cool $40 million. "The Wolf Of Wall Street" has raked in over $392 million since it's Christmas Day release last year. Belfort was played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated Martin Scorsese film. Belfort spent 22 months in prison after defrauding more than 1,500 investors during his career as a stockbroker in the 1980s. He was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to victims of Stratton Oakmont. He hasn’t finished paying them back yet, but has said that he would be able to finish doing so thanks to his $100 million speaking tour.  As a stockbroker, he made about $50 million per year. In December, Belfort was pitching an uplifting reality show to various networks, in which he would "step in to help others who, like him, have hit rock bottom but still hold out some hope for redemption," according to The Hollywood Reporter. No word yet on whether the show has been picked up. FREE AppDownload
Aeropostale announced today that its CEO Thomas Johnson will leave the company. Julian Geiger, who previously served as the company's CEO, will re-join the company in the same capacity.  Johnson was named the clothing chain's sole CEO on December 1, 2010, and since that date, Aeropostale shares have fallen more than 85% from around $25 per share to $3.24 as of Monday's close. Aeropostale also said Monday that in the second quarter, sales fell 13% to $396.2 million from $454 million, and the company expects to lose $0.80 to $0.83 pe share in the quarter. Excluding certain items, losses are expected to be $0.42 to $0.45 in the second quarter.  And in after hours trade Monday, investors were shaking off the poor results and cheering a new presence at the top of the company, with shares up more than 7%.  But it's not just the stock price that paints a picture of how awful Johnson's tenure as CEO really was.  On Twitter, Rob Wilson, president of Tiburon Research Group, tweeted a chart showing operating margins for Aeropostale since Johnson was named CEO. (The operating margin represents a company's pre-tax, pre-interest profits as a percentage of sales.) At the time Johnson took the helm at Aeropostale, margins were running at about 16%. As of the second quarter of this year, those margins had fallen to -8%.  As Wilson said on Twitter, "Possibly the absolute worst tenure in specialty apparel retail history comes to an end at [Aeropostale]."

Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesIt seems inevitable that interest rates will soon be on the rise.Though they’ve defied expectations this year, higher interest rates appear to be all but inevitable. Investors need to take measure of the rate sensitivity in their portfolios — and stay agile — to negotiate the rough market crosscurrents a rate reversal may bring.  We expect the shift to be gradual, judging from US Federal Reserve’s commitment to tying future rate increases to a sustained economic recovery. Widespread predictions that bond yields would continue to climb following last year’s uptick have proven premature, as renewed geopolitical anxieties and the still-anemic global recovery have rekindled investor affection for the safe havens of US, German, UK and even Japanese sovereign bonds. As our research has shown, equities typically do very well when rising rates coincide with a strengthening economy. Nonetheless, a rate reversal, when it comes, will mark a significant departure from a status quo sustained by years of super-easy monetary policies and a 30-year downtrend in US Treasury bond yields. The shift will influence market yields globally—and, we think, could spark a major shift in market leadership. Investors will not want to be caught wrong-footed. Stocks in some “safer” (income-oriented) industries, such as utilities, tobacco, telecom and real estate investment trusts, are the most obviously vulnerable. Their dividends will look less appealing as the yields on less volatile fixed-income alternatives climb. These bond proxies have become popular with yield-hungry investors, driving up their valuations, and according them an outsized presence in many portfolios. As a result, investors may be far less diversified versus their bond holdings than they realize. Other victims of rising rates include housing-related stocks, such as homebuilders, building-materials suppliers and even home-improvement retailers, as rising rates make owning and maintaining homes more expensive.  Mortgage insurers and originators could also prove at risk, though the story here is more nuanced. Rising rates clearly make buying or refinancing a home less attractive. However, if higher rates are a by-product of a strengthening economy, their impact may be offset by greater housing demand and, as important, improvements in credit quality. Finally, higher borrowing costs will put pressure on a broader set of capital purchases, such as for automobiles and equipment, which are typically financed. On the other side of the ledger, a rotation out of defensives would likely favor cheaper, more cyclically sensitive stocks in materials, energy and consumer discretionary industries. But positive rate sensitivity lurks in many other corners as well.  Financial stocks are an obvious example. Banks typically see a nice boost in their net interest margins if long-term rates rise faster than short-term rates (as is typical in an economic recovery). The situation for insurers is more mixed. Life insurers tend to benefit from rising rates, as they should bolster returns of their predominantly fixed-income general account investments and reduce balance-sheet-impairment risks. More subtle is the impact on their annuity portfolios. Earnings from these businesses have been under pressure over the past several years, as declining reinvestment rates made it tougher to meet the high minimum-return guarantees on these vehicles. As rates pick up, policyholders are more likely to let these contracts lapse, as they pursue higher-return alternatives. Rising rates are trickier for property and casualty insurers and reinsurers. Though they too benefit from improved returns on their investment portfolios, history shows that this is often offset by more aggressive (re)insurance pricing as less underwriting income is required to achieve total-return hurdles. Moreover, claims losses tend to climb as the economy improves and inflation rises. However, the recent influx of third-party capital seeking the uncorrelated returns of catastrophic insurance has been depressing rates for a couple of years now. Higher returns elsewhere might stem this tide. The economic ripple effects of rising rates will be varied and subtle, differing from industry to industry and from company to company. In our view, these times call for active investing approaches, which have the flexibility to anticipate and react to whipsawing market conditions and adjust exposures accordingly.

Thomson ReutersAdvertisement for the e-cigarette brand blu is seen on window of a store in New York(Reuters) - A German court has ordered a subsidiary of U.S. tobacco giant Lorillard Inc to stop selling the popular blu e-cigarettes in that country, citing trademark confusion with lighter and fuel products sold by Zippo Manufacturing Co. Pennsylvania-based Zippo, which announced the preliminary injunction against Cygnet UK Trading on Monday, is also engaged in a high-stakes trademark fight over the blu name in the United States and several other countries. "I am very pleased that the German court affirmed our legal rights to our intellectual property," Zippo Chief Executive Officer Gregory Booth said in a statement, adding that the company was working "vigorously" to protect its trademarks worldwide. Robert Bannon, director of investor relations at Lorillard, said the injunction will only impact online sales since the blu e-cigs are not currently sold at retail stores in Germany. In a statement, Lorillard said the company would defend against "these types of opportunistic trolling tactics. Zippo has shown it is willing to try to unfairly capitalize on the commercial success of others when it has failed to prevail in the marketplace." The Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main said in its Aug. 6 injunction that the blu e-cig brand created a "likelihood of confusion" with Zippo's European Union "BLU" trademark on butane lighters and fuel, according to Zippo. Zippo has also filed to kill blu e-cigarette trademark applications or cancel registrations in Canada and Mexico. Sweden has already rejected a blu application by Lorillard, Zippo said. The German decision comes as the two companies are going head-to-head in federal court in California. Lorillard U.S. subsidiary LOEC Inc, which makes the blu e-cigarettes, sued Zippo last April seeking a court declaration that its products do not infringe on Zippo's trademarks. It took the action after Zippo filed its opposition to several of Lorillard's applications for the blu name and design with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and threatened litigation, according to court documents. LOEC argued that there was "no likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception" with Zippo's BLU lighters because the products did not compete with each other and consumers were sophisticated enough to know the difference. Meanwhile, Zippo has filed counterclaims against LOEC, seeking to prevent the sale of blu-brand e-cigarettes. A jury trial is scheduled for April 2015. Since Lorillard acquired blu in 2012, the brand has gained 47 percent of U.S. market share of e-cigarettes. Annual sales have quadrupled to more than $200 million. The blu e-cig business is being sold to Imperial Tobacco Group as part of Lorillard's $27.4 billion merger with Reynolds American Inc, which was announced last month.   (Reporting by Andrew Chung, editing by G Crosse and Ted Botha) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTo match Special Report PIMCO/GROSS(Reuters) - Pimco said on Monday it hired Mohsen Fahmi, formerly of Moore Capital Management, as managing director and generalist portfolio manager focusing on global fixed income assets. Fahmi, who will report to Mihir Worah, deputy chief investment officer at Pimco, served in various capacities at Moore Capital, most recently as a senior portfolio manager. Fahmi will begin with Pimco on September 2. Fahmi spent 11 years at Moore in both London and New York, including three years as its chief operating officer. Prior to that, Fahmi worked for a number of investment banks, including Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. Since the abrupt departure of Mohamed El-Erian in January, Pimco has undergone a leadership shakeup that has included the hire of Paul McCulley, managing director and chief economist, a new role for the Newport Beach, California, firm. Pimco, which oversees $1.97 trillion in assets as of June 30, has hired senior talent across its broad investment platform throughout this year. Recent hires include: Sudi Mariappa, as managing director and generalist portfolio manager; Geraldine Sundstrom, as managing director and portfolio manager who will assume a leadership role in asset allocation; Rick Chan, as executive vice president and portfolio manager focused on interest rate derivative strategies; Jason Goldberg, as executive vice president and portfolio manager focused on equity derivative strategies; Harley Bassman, as executive vice president and portfolio manager focused on volatility trading; and Ethan Schwartz, as executive vice president and portfolio manager focused on distressed credit.   (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Dan Grebler) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Mark MakelaAn Amish boy jumps on a trampoline at his home in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.Stocks were in rally mode on Monday as the Dow added 1% and the Nasdaq made a new 14-year high. Stocks opened higher, and with no geopolitical concerns or major economic data to key off, markets stayed near their highs for most of the day. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. The lone economic data point out of the U.S. was the National Association of Homebuilders' latest homebuilder confidence survey, which showed the headline index climbing to 55 in July from 53 in June. This reading, which was a seven-month high for the index, also topped expectations for a reading of 54. "Homebuilder sentiment stands only three points below where it stood a year ago. History suggests that the index of future single-family sales is a reasonable gauge of start activity six months ahead. We view this report as consistent with our outlook that improved sentiment should support start activity in the coming quarters," said Barclays' Michael Gapen. 2. In mergers and acquisitions news, Dollar General made a $9.7 billion bid for Family Dollar that topped the $8.95 billion offer made in late July by Dollar Tree. Dollar General's offer sent shares of Family Dollar up 5% to more than $78.50 per share value implied in its offer, indicating that investors think an even higher offer for Family Dollar could materialize.  3. Shares of TASER International were up more than 5% after gaining more than 9% on Friday as investors view the situation in Ferguson as a catalyst for increased orders of TASER's wearable police cameras. 4. Procter &amp; Gamble, which last month said it would divest up to 100 of its brands, is likely to offload its Duracell and Braun brands, according to a Reuters report. Duracell, which is the world's best-selling battery brand, has estimated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, of $500 million.  5. Palladium prices hit a 13-year high of $900 per troy ounce, as investors make bets that sanctions against Russia will limit global supply of the "white metal." Use of palladium is concentrated in the auto industry, and in a recent note to clients, Morgan Stanley's Adam Longson said prices are likely to be supported for some time due to expectations of reduced supply.  6. Goldman Sachs expects the S&amp;P 500 to return 6% over the next twelve months ahead of the Federal Reserve's first anticipated interest rate increase. "Markets do not always follow historical patterns," Goldman's David Kostin and his equity strategy team write, "but we forecast the S&amp;P 500 will rise by 6% during the next 12 months before the expected first Fed hike in 3Q 2015. Stocks also rallied during the year ahead of first Fed tightening actions in 1994, 1999, and 2004. Both micro and macro data suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening." 7. Famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates was a guest on Barry Ritholtz's Master in Business radio program this weekend on Bloomberg radio, and among other topics Chanos debunked the two biggest truisms in short-selling and the stagnant growth in corporate America.  Don't Miss: The U.S. Condo Market Is Making A Comeback » FREE AppDownload
All eyes are on Janet Yellen this week as she gives her speech to the Kansas City Fed's Economic Policy Symposium. Traders will be listening to the Fed chair for any clues that might reveal the timing and direction of monetary. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris warns against reading too into the market's reaction on the day of the speech. "Looking back, the signals from the Chairman speeches are clearer in hindsight than in real time," he writes. "For example, Chart 2 compares the change in 10-year yields on the day of Bernanke’s speech at Jackson Hole to the change in yields over the rest of the year. Sometimes the speech provides a hint of things to come, but overall, there is no correlation between market response to the speech and the market movement over the rest of the year." The Jackson Hole symposium became famous in 2010 when then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke prepared the world for QE2, a second round of stimulative bond purchases. "The Fed did eventually adopt QE2 , but it wasn't until three months later, after a long string of additional hints," said Harris. "The “urban legend” is that Bernanke clearly signaled QE2 at Jackson Hole; the truth is he nudged along an idea that was already in the works." Harris' scatter plot reveals little correlation between the bond market's response on the day of the speech and its move during the balance of the year. If there were, the dots would form a straight line from the bottom left to the top right. Bank of America Merrill Lynch FREE AppDownload
FinVizPrices went as high as $900 Monday. Palladium briefly hit $900 a troy ounce on Monday for the first time since 2001, according to Mining.com, as investors took positions on sanctions against Russia limiting global supplies. The "white" metal has climbed 7% since hitting monthly lows August 5.  "Palladium investors [moved] convincingly net long amid expectations long term supply may be suppressed due to recent sanctions imposed against Russia and a firming demand environment," TD Securities said in a recent note.  Morgan Stanley's Adam Longson said prices are likely to be supported for some time for those same reasons. It's now now up 24% this year, the third-greatest gains among all commodities, according to FinViz. Prices saw momentum earlier this year on South African mining strikes. Russia and South Africa combine for 80% of the world's global palladium output, according to Mining.com. Palladium use is concentrated in the auto industry.

LinkedIn Venture capitalist Corey Griffin, who had just raised $100,000 for the ALS "Ice Bucket Challenge", died after diving off a building in Nantucket this weekend, the Boston Globe reports. He was 27. According to Nantucket Police, Griffin dived off the "Juice Guys" building on Straight Wharf at 2 a.m. Witnesses told police that Griffin floated to the surface and then went under not resurfacing again. Colin Perry, an off-duty lifeguard who was nearby, made several rescue dives and recovered Griffin from the bottom of the harbor. CPR was unsuccessful, the police report said. He was pronounced dead at 3 a.m. at Nantucket Cottage Hospital. FoursquareGriffin, who worked for New York-based finance firm Risk Assistance Network + Exchange (RANE), was good friends with Pete Frates — the former Boston College baseball captain credited with making the "Strike Out ALS: Ice Bucket Challenge" go viral. "Team FrateTrain lost a good friend today, Corey Griffin," Frates posted on Facebook. "Helping out was nothing new for Griff. He held his own event for me back in 2012, just a few months after diagnosis. He worked his butt off these last few weeks for ALS. We texted everyday, planning and scheming ways to raise funds and plan events." Griffin graduated from Babson College. He played hockey at Boston College before transferring to Babson.

Screenshot via Bloomberg TVBill Fleckenstein, President of Fleckenstein Capital, told King World News that he anticipated big problems for stocks and bonds down the road.

There’s not going to be any liquidity on the downside because of what’s happened in the banks — the algorithms and all that other stuff.  But none of that matters until it matters. So you just have to understand what the mosaic is and what the facts are, but you can’t try to act on them until it starts to matter if you are going to express a view that is going against the printing of the central banks. Fleckenstein also said Yellen might have to start QE4 if the stock market "cracks" as the Fed winds down its asset-purchase program this year.

AmazonStocks go up and down. Usually. David Kostin and the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs write that in the next 12 months, ahead of the Fed's first rate hike, the S&amp;P 500 will rise 6%.  "Markets do not always follow historical patterns," Kostin and his team write, "but we forecast the S&amp;P 500 will rise by 6% during the next 12 months before the expected first Fed hike in 3Q 2015. Stocks also rallied during the year ahead of first Fed tightening actions in 1994, 1999, and 2004. Both micro and macro data suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening." Kostin and his team also reiterate their call from earlier this month that a "dramatic divergence" is coming to stocks and bonds in the several years. Goldman still expects stocks to return an inflation-adjusted 4% annualized through 2018 and bonds to return -1% when adjusting for inflation. These returns for stocks and bonds also assume interest rates get back to their normal historical average of 4%. In this scenario, this is what rates and returns for stocks and bonds would look like.  Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersLew testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the Financial Stability Oversight Council's annual report, on Capitol Hill in WashingtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration will need more than a few weeks to weigh potential administrative actions to discourage U.S. companies from reducing their tax bills by moving to other countries, a Treasury Department official said on Monday. Staff at the U.S. Treasury has been assembling a list of options for Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. "The issues are complex, so the work will not be done in a week or two," said the official, who asked not to be identified. Analysts are divided over how much the administration could deter inversions without legislation, and Lew and other officials have been urging lawmakers to act on the matter. "We cannot wait months and years for Congress to act while inversions erode our corporate tax base," the official said on Monday. Under an inversion, a U.S. company shifts its tax home base to a lower-tax country by combining with a company based in that country. Popular destinations are Ireland and the Netherlands. The Treasury has said previously it was looking for ways to make it harder and less rewarding for companies to engage in inversions. "The secretary is hoping to have recommendations from his team in the near future," the official said on Monday. While some Democratic lawmakers are clamoring for anti-inversion legislation, Republicans say the issue should only be addressed through comprehensive tax reform, which is not expected to occur this year.

For car owners, the costs don't end after you've made your all of your car payments. Ownership costs include gas, insurance and repairs, which vary significantly across the country. Bankrate.com recently published the results of their 2014 car cost study for the 50 states and Washington D.C. Business Insider created maps to show were there are concentrated areas for car ownership spending. We broke up the data into quartiles, and also determined whether or not there were any outliers, that is states were the cost was unusually expensive or cheap.  On the maps you can see that there tend to be geographic trends for individual variables of car expense.  Business Insider/Elena Holodny, data from Bankrate There are clumps in the southeast and the northeast, where states pay more for overall car ownership than the majority of the country. The midwest and the northwest seemed to be less expensive areas. Wyoming was the most expensive and an outlier, with $2705 per year. The next most expensive state was Louisiana: $2555. The least expensive state overall: Iowa, $1942. The median price is $2213. Business Insider/Elena Holodny, data from Bankrate States on the west coast and parts of the northeast spent were relatively inexpensive regions for gas costs. On the other hand, states in the midwest and the South were more on the costly side. In addition to gas prices, Bankrate's gas cost measure considers average fuel efficiency and average miles traveled. Again, Wyoming was the most expensive and an outlier with $1558.Washington D.C. was the least expensive and also an outlier with $618. The next most expensive state for gasoline spending: Alabama, $1237.The least expensive state for gasoline spending: New York, $713.The median price is $988. Business Insider/Elena Holodny, data from Bankrate People living in the northeast, the south, and the west coast spent the most on insurance. And those living in the center of the country spent spent much less on insurance. The most expensive state for insurance spending: Louisiana $1277.The least expensive state for insurance spending: Iowa, $630.The median price is $848. There were no outliers for insurance spending. Business Insider/Elena Holodny, data from Bankrate Overall, repair prices are a smaller percentage of car expenses than gasoline and insurance — but they do still factor in. People living on the west and east coasts spent the most on repair costs. Those living in the midwest spent the least. The most expensive state for repair costs: New Jersey, $393.The least expensive state for repair costs: Vermont, $270.The median price is $356. There were no outliers in repairs spending.

Roger Wollstadt via FlickrThe U.S. condominium market is rebounding, according to Sam Khater at CoreLogic. Condo construction completions were up 11% year-over-year to 2,100 buildings.  More proof of strengthening in the condo market comes from the absorption rate — the share of units sold within the first three months of completion — which hit 82%in 2013, up from 36% low seen during the financial crisis. "One reason that absorption rates have risen is that condo pricing has normalized in two important dimensions: the condo price premium vis-a`-vis the single-family market and the new versus existing condo price premium," writes Khater. "The normalization in both price dimensions is important because it will draw more condo buyers back into the market and spur even more construction." This chart shows that the price of condos relative to single-family detached home prices has declined to levels seen in the early 2000s. This compares to March 2008, when condo prices were 37% above the median single-family detached home price. By July 2013 however it was 1% lower CoreLogic Meanwhile, "the correction of the new condo price premium relative to existing condo prices has taken longer," according to Khater. CoreLogic The recovery in construction and price normalization are important because "condos are one of the few sources of affordable housing," writes Khater. FREE AppDownload
Getty/Brendon HoffmanBy: Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Howard Coble (R-NC), John Conyers Jr. (D-MI), Steve Chabot (R-OH), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and George Holding (R-NC), Members of the House Judiciary Committee Unlike a patent or copyright, a trade secret is non-public intellectual property. It gains economic value because of its secrecy. Some of the most recognized trade secrets include Coca-Cola’s formula and KFC’s famous recipe, but trade secrets include many different types of confidential business information critical to the success of both large and small companies in the United States. The devastating reality is that theft of trade secrets costs the American economy billions of dollars per year.1 Although criminal laws exist to combat such theft, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] said in a recent Congressional hearing that “[p]rotecting the nation’s economy from this threat is not something the FBI can accomplish on its own.”2 Trade secret owners take reasonable measures to keep this information out of the public eye because once it is disclosed, its protection is gone forever. According to the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, “trade secrets are all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether stored or unstored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing...”3 While some trade secrets might be eligible for other types of intellectual property protection, many involving the methods and processes necessary to create products are not. In February 2013, the Executive Office of the President released a report documenting the scope of trade secret theft which showed serious cause for concern. The report first states that, “[e]merging trends indicate that the pace of economic espionage and trade secret theft against U.S. corporations is accelerating”4 including many recent attacks originating from foreign governments. Second, the report gives examples of the magnitude of trade secret theft to individual companies (such as theft of Ford’s trade secret valued at $50 million,5 theft of a Goldman Sachs trade secret valued at $500 million,6 a stolen Dupont trade secret valued at $400 million7) but one may conclude that trade secret theft in the U.S. is vast, and possibly too great to quantify. Protection for trade secrets in the U.S. is currently accomplished through a patchwork of Federal criminal law and state civil statutes. Criminal cases are prosecuted by the FBI.8 While significant resources have been dedicated to the FBI for trade secret theft in recent years, “the number of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets cases overseen by the unit increased by more than 60 percent”9 between 2009 and 2013. American businesses own an estimated $5 trillion dollars of trade secrets, with roughly $300 billion of that stolen per year.10 At this rate, a criminal cause of action alone is not enough. That is why we introduced the “Trade Secrets Protection Act of 2014” to create a civil cause of action that allows trade secret owners to directly combat theft of their intellectual property in federal court. Our bill will provide U.S. companies with additional tools to combat destructive threats to valuable information. While state laws may have been effective in the past, the digital information age has changed the dynamic of trade secret theft.11 Theft of proprietary information is no longer only physical misappropriation, but now may include hundreds of files downloaded onto a flash drive or sent around the world instantaneously. Moreover, not all state laws are identical, nor are state court procedures, which adds to the complexity of seeking remedies in this venue. Instead, expanding the venue of civil trade secret actions to federal court will foster the development of a national standard for use by businesses of all types and sizes to protect their intellectual property. The current patchwork is simply not enough to combat organized trade secret theft. All other forms of intellectual property – patents, copyrights, and trademarks – are afforded a civil cause of action in federal law. It is time we confer trade secrets with a similar level of protection to substantially mitigate the billions of dollars lost annually through theft of our intellectual property. 1.

ReutersAdd Jim Chanos' to the number of voices worried that American companies are running out of gas and in need of real consumer demand to create revenue. In an interview with Bloomberg's Masters in Business, hosted by Barry Ritholtz, Chanos explained how corporate buybacks were less a sign of strength and more a cry for help from American companies. He said: "What worries me is that corporate America in aggregate, has pre-tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens. The long-term expected rate of the equity markets, is roughly half that. And when corporations embarked on massive buybacks across all industries and all companies, in effect these CEOs are buying the stock market. So what they’re telling you then, is unequivocally that they think that either they’re happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better. Or their rate of return on the margin of any new capital project is much much lower, in fact half or less of what is stated. And that does not bode well for the future of profits, or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits." The point is that there will come a time when companies won't be able to hide their lack of revenue growth with share buybacks or other handy tools. Barclays' U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Glionna wrote about this last week, and he also pointed out that what these companies really need is not accounting hoodoo, but rather it's the almighty American consumer. "We believe U.S. equities are transitioning out of a recovery rally and into a period of lower returns as the benefits of margin expansion and share repurchases prove to be already priced in and a return of faster revenue growth becomes a prerequisite for another re-rating higher," he wrote. That faster revenue growth was supposed to come from the purchasing power of the American consumer. Ideally — as in some ideas we had back in 2008 and 2009 — by this time, this all-encompassing market force was supposed to have bounced back from the recession and started spending money again. But it hasn't. U.S. Retail sales growth has crept down from May's 0.4% to June's 0.2% to July's flat growth. As Business Insider's Sam Ro pointed out, it was the worst retail sales number in six months. Last week Wal-Mart lowered its guidance for the third quarter and revised down full-year earnings to $4.90 to $5.15 per share from previous guidance of $5.10 to $5.45. According to FactSet, for 63 companies have issued negative earnings per share guidance and 26 companies have issued positive earnings per share guidance for the third quarter of 2014. In other words, not even American companies think they can pull it out in this environment. Check out the chart below: FactSet So there will be no rescue from the American consumer, at least not right now. All of this makes for a risky environment in the meantime, especially as corporate cash flows remain high but flat (more on this here). To please shareholders, companies still have to figure out how to keep stock prices afloat. That could mean buying more stock while prices are high — which should not please shareholders — or it could mean going another route. Chanos says that corporate balance sheets are looking healthier because analysts aren't deducting acquisitions from a company's cash flow as they should. “Increasingly we’re seeing acquisitions, which are not taken out of most analysts for cash flow numbers, acquisition are replacing CapEx or R&amp;D," Chanos said. "So companies are buying their R&amp;D or their capital, and that should [be] properly deducted from cash flow, because in aggregate corporate America is not growing. So by buying each other and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they’re capitalizing their R&amp;D … and that particularly applies for big tech, which are perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a reasonable rate is because they’re buying other companies.” So what we have here is a race against time. If you buy all this, the stock market needs the American consumer to come back soon to prevent some serious selling — earnings are not what they seem. We've stopped growing. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Anatolii StepanovDuracell is the world's best-selling battery brand.NEW YORK (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble is working with advisors including Goldman Sachs Group as the world's largest household products maker reviews up to 100 underperforming brands for potential divestiture, people familiar with the matter said. While P&amp;G has yet to determine which brands it will seek to shed, Duracell batteries and Braun shavers are the two largest assets likely to be divested, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. The company, which also makes Gillette razors and Tide detergent, said this month it would consider selling more than half its brands whose sales have been declining for the past three years, a drastic attempt to revive growth and save costs. These brands up for review are estimated to have roughly $900 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) combined, the people said. Duracell, the world's No.1 battery business, alone accounts for the majority of the value with estimated EBITDA of around $500 million, according to one person. Braun is the next largest brand likely to be shed, with less than $100 million in EBITDA, that person added. Several private equity firms have already started exploring potential deals involving various P&amp;G brands, according to the people familiar with the matter. Representatives for P&amp;G could not be immediately reached for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. P&amp;G did not name any of the brands it planned to sell but Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said the company would narrow its focus to 70 to 80 of its biggest brands, which include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. These top brands generate 90 percent of its $83 billion in annual sales and over 95 percent of its profit. The sweeping move is a major strategy shift for the consumer products giant, whose revenue growth has been sluggish, with sales missing Wall Street's estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters. It also reflects a wider trend among conglomerates across various industry sectors to streamline their business lines, by shedding non-core operations and allocating resources to high growth areas. Large consumer companies like Nestle SA and Unilever Plc have shed underperforming businesses in the last year to focus on their top brands. Healthcare giants including Merck &amp; Co, Abbott Laboratories  and GlaxoSmithKline Plc have also moved to shed their declining mature drug businesses in recent months. P&amp;G says it has been hurt by "choppy" growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar. The company has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012. FREE AppDownload
Meet The Parents screenshotAccording to the famous short-seller Jim Chanos, if you want to know what it's like shorting stocks, think about what it's like being under interrogation. In an interview with Barry Ritholtz for the Bloomberg radio segment Masters in Business, Chanos said that since short sellers are constantly being told that they're wrong, they need to be able to withhold information, and ignore superfluous market noise. "When I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the US, another 40 globally, I can pretty much be sure that 20% of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimate raised, CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be. And most of that is noise. But it’s the noise that most people in the market are used to," Chanos said. "And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out, and say, ‘Okay that’s all well and good, but that’s in the price of the stock and we know that, and the facts that I have are very important, and the market doesn’t really know that or appreciate how important they are.'" Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, is well known for his ability to research and spot fraudulent companies. He rose to prominence for exposing insurance fraud in Baldwin United in 1982. He was one of the first to call out Enron before it collapsed. "I think the research is the same, and I think that good research should be taught both long and short side and it should be the same," he said. "The ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that’s a different attribute." When Chanos first started shorting stocks, he thought it would be the mirror image of going long. Now he believes that much of it is rooted in behavioral finance. "I think we’re all, by and large, the listeners of this show and others, are the product of positive reinforcement cycles. And most people’s rational decision making, studies have shown, breaks down in an environment of negative reinforcement," he said.

AmazonAmazon recently declared war on the mobile-payments industry with Amazon Local Register, a card reader similar to dongles offered by Square and eBay's PayPal. What makes Amazon Local Register such a threat is that it undercuts all of its competitors. Amazon is offering a promotional rate of 1.75% per card swipe on credit and debit cards until Jan. 1, 2016. After that, the rate will rise to 2.5% per swipe, which is still cheaper than any competitor — Square charges 2.75% per swipe, PayPal charges 2.7%, and Google Wallet charges 2.9% per transaction. Amazon is also basically giving away the card reader free, since its $10 price tag is erased by $10 in transaction credit. Let's take a closer look at Local Register to better understand what Amazon plans to gain from this aggressive new strategy. Amazon's plan is squarely aimed at small brick-and-mortar businesses, the same market that Square, PayPal, and Google have pursued. The theory is simple — the clunky old point-of-sale, or POS, systems will eventually die out in an era of smartphones and tablets. Research firm IHL Group forecasts that mobile POS devices will replace 12.4% of traditional POS systems in North America by 2016. According to TechNavio, the global markets for POS system software and hardware will respectively be worth $3.2 billion and $31.5 billion by the end of 2014. PayPal offers three products to replace POS systems — a $15 card-reading dongle, a Bluetooth device known as Beacon that allows customers to check in and pay at stores hands-free, and a stand-alone mobile chip and card reader that costs around $120. Square's business is heavily centered on mobile devices. It offers Reader, its card-swiping dongle for iOS and Android, for free. Its full POS system, Stand, costs $99 and converts iPads into sleek checkout registers. Register, an app for iOS and Android devices, can accept manually entered credit card payments. Square also offers Market, which is like a reverse version of Amazon — customers who use Square's POS systems can also advertise their wares online through the site. SquareGoogle doesn't offer card readers or POS systems — it relies completely on near field communications and online transactions. But like PayPal, Google offers a Google Wallet card, a physical debit card that can be used at participating retailers. Square recently canceled its plans to launch a similar card. PayPal, Square, and Google all help participating businesses track customers and sales trends — a feature that Amazon's Local Register will also offer. Amazon's grand plan is to combine its massive e-commerce presence with brick-and-mortar businesses into a single, seamless payment ecosystem. With brick-and-mortar stores, Local Register is a simple idea that could spread like wildfire, since the average POS system can cost up to $1,500 and even more to upgrade. In addition to the card reader, Amazon is selling accessories such as cash drawers, receipt printers, and stands so that small businesses can assemble a modular "buy what you need" POS system. Amazon already allows online stores to pay with their Amazon accounts. The idea is similar to Facebook's login strategy on other websites — letting Amazon handle the transaction is simply an easier alternative to typing in all of your credit card information again. An interesting aspect of Local Register is that while funds are transferred into a seller's bank account the next business day, they immediately become available on Amazon.com, and could possibly encourage sellers to spend some of their earnings on Amazon's products and services. In conclusion, eBay and Square clearly need to watch their backs. Amazon has never been shy about taking losses to achieve long-term goals, and it certainly has the market presence and firepower to level the mobile payments market. Google doesn't have much to lose, since Wallet has yet to catch on, but it could be letting Amazon claim a market that it could have dominated with more aggressive tactics. Amazon is frequently criticized for headline-grabbing gimmicks — such as drones, barcode-scanning pens, and head-tracking smartphones — but I believe that Local Register is a solid, smart strategy that leverages the company's greatest strengths to bridge the gap between brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.   The plastic in your wallet is about to go the way of the typewriter, the VCR, and the 8-track tape player. When it does, a handful of investors could stand to get very rich. You can join them — but you must act now. An eye-opening new presentation reveals the full story on why your credit card is about to be worthless — and highlights one little-known company sitting at the epicenter of an earth-shaking movement that could hand early investors the kind of profits we haven't seen since the dot-com days.  Click here to watch this stunning video.

Thomson ReutersChinese customers select food on a shelf where Heinz products are displayed in a market in ShanghaiBEIJING (Reuters) - Ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co has recalled some infant food in eastern China after it was found to contain lead in excess of the allowable limit, the company said on Monday. The move by Heinz comes after food safety regulators in eastern Zhejiang province said on Friday that they had found "excessive amounts of lead" in the company's AD Calcium Hi-Protein Cereal. Heinz said it is recalling four batches of the product as a precautionary measure after a test found it exceeded the allowable limit for lead. "This relates to an isolated regional withdrawal in eastern China," company spokesman Michael Mullen said in e-mailed comments to Reuters. "Extensive testing confirmed that no other Heinz baby food varieties are affected." On Sunday the Zhejiang Food and Drug Administration said the problem affected 1,472 boxes in Zhejiang and that Heinz had told the agency it would destroy the other 153 boxes that are sealed in a warehouse in the southern city of Guangzhou. The regulator urged Heinz to compensate its customers. Heinz said it "apologises for any inconvenience caused and would like to assure consumers that Heinz is 100 percent committed to food quality and safety". Chinese consumers are highly sensitive to safety concerns relating to infant products after a 2008 scandal involving melamine-contaminated baby milk powder. At least six babies died and thousands more fell ill. Last year Fonterra  said it found a potentially fatal bacteria in one of its products, triggering recalls of infant milk formula and sports drinks in nine countries including China. Experts say exposure to lead is particularly dangerous for children, inhibiting intellectual and physical development. It can cause poor concentration, disruptive behavior and even death when subjected to high levels.  (Reporting by Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by David Goodman) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidJim Chanos.The two biggest truisms of short-selling are not true. This weekend, Jim Chanos, famed short seller and director of Kynikos Associates, was a guest on Barry Ritholtz's Masters in Business program on Bloomberg Radio. At one point in their discussion, Ritholtz brings up the famous anti-short-selling argument that when you short a stock, the most you can make is 100%. Chanos quickly rejects this idea.  As Chanos explains: If you start with a short position at $100 with no other cash in your account, and you short the stock and it goes down to $50, you can, without adding any more cash capital to the account, short additional shares. And if it keeps going your way, you can compound your return. Ritholtz notes that you still face the same types of risks that many bring up when discussing short-selling, and which we’ve written about before, namely margin calls, short squeezes, and the like. Chanos says that this is still the case, but as to the statement that you can’t make more than 100% on initial capital on a short position: “That’s not true.” Chanos also takes on another accepted "truth" regarding short-selling: that short sellers face infinite losses. For one, if you're short, you can put in stop-losses, or automatic price levels at which you cover your short, thus preventing the theoretically infinite losses. But Chanos also brings up another argument, which is that if you’re investing in a partnership, and you’re a limited partner, you can lose only what you put up. Chanos and Ritholtz spend a lot of their conversation discussing psychology and behavioral finance, and Chanos wraps up the debunking of these two market adages saying:  These are examples of thinking that that are accurate on their face, but in practicality they're inaccurate. Because you structure things to not let that happen and you can actually get protection through the structure of the investment vehicle to obviate those risks. But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. Ritholtz's series is fantastic, and it is required listening for anybody who wants to hear real talk from real market pros.  You can download the whole discussion with Chanos, and the rest of Ritholtz's episodes, from Bloomberg here.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersRoofers work on new homes at a residential construction site in the west side of the Las Vegas Valley in Las VegasNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest since January as labor market conditions improved, data from the National Association of Home Builders showed on Monday.

It was the third straight monthly gain, and topped the mean estimate of analysts polled by Reuters for a reading of 53. Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. "Each of the three components of the HMI registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe. "Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand." The single-family home sales component rose to 58 from a revised 56 and was also the highest reading since January. The gauge of single-family sales expectations for the next six months rose to 65, the highest since August 2013, while prospective buyer traffic rose from 39 to 42, the highest since December.

It’s something that the pastor don’t preachIt’s something that a teacher can’t teach - Kanye West, ‘No Church in the Wild’   I met with a money manager earlier this year who walked my colleagues and I through his firm’s investing process, which was a trading scheme based on a combination of 19 different technical analysis metrics. The outside rep who came to see us was young and enthusiastic about his firm’s approach, even though he couldn’t answer basic questions about whether or not those 19 variables had actually been measured for efficacy in terms of returns and risk. In the absence of these details, he relied heavily on the mantra of “process.” When we asked a hypothetical about a period of prolonged large drawdowns and what the portfolio managers’ response might be, we were told that “We’re process oriented, but if something big’s going on, we can totally step in and do what we have to do.” On the surface, this statement is obviously hilarious. We showed him the door shortly afterwards, with a non-committal “we’ll be in touch.” Even more hilarious was the fact this gentleman’s firm manages over $5 billion – mostly for other professionals, but I digress… The thing is, some of the greatest investors of all time have tossed out their playbooks and improvised at opportune times. Either they got lucky or they saw something obvious that no one else did, but either way, it was the key to their transcendence. It’s literally the thing that allowed them to rise above. We don’t hear much about the majority of people who did this and failed. We do tend to deify the ones who pulled a miracle out of their asses. That’s the mythology of the markets at work. And then every once in awhile, we come across an investor who is able to do this repeatedly – break the “rules” and trade on pure instinct right at the moment when it counts. According to his son, Robert, Soros’s trading was always influenced by more than reflexivity. “My father will sit down and give you theories to explain why he does this or that”, he once said, “but I remember seeing it as a kid and thinking, ‘Jesus Christ, at least half of this is bullshit’. “I mean, you know [that] the reason he changes his position on the market or whatever is because his back starts killing him. It has nothing to do with reason. He literally goes into a spasm and it’s this early warning sign.” Soros has admitted to relying greatly on “animal instincts”, saying the onset of acute pain was often “a signal that there was something wrong in my portfolio”. His decisions, then, “are really made using a combination of theory and instinct”. The above comes from a piece at the Irish Times this week celebrating the 84th birthday of one of the world’s most successful and brilliant investors, George Soros. Soros is an exceptionally deep thinker and clearly has a winning investment process. He’s the only hedge fund manager to have earned $40 billion in profits for his investors and the biggest money-making fund since inception on the planet (having pulled ahead of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater again after last year’s $5.5 billion bonanza). This $40 billion in profit is even more impressive when you contemplate the fact that this is all money he’s taken out of the market – over the course of decades – from other skilled traders who’ve been on the other side of his moves. He’s an alpha predator on a global scale – there’s never been anyone quite like him, before or since. And for Soros and his Quantum fund, process has only been a part of the story. Having a process is fine, but when a process meets the Real World, as Soros’s process surely has over the last four decades, it’s not going to beat the market on its own. At the end of the day, instinct is what’s going to be the difference between mediocrity and outstanding returns. Luck will surely play a role too – but the longevity and consistency of this track record is proof of another element at work. Most of us – statistically – won’t possess an instinct like that or won’t be able to reliably use it. That won’t stop most of us from trying. Process is helpful, being lucky is great too, but unhinging one’s jaw at just the right moment and devouring an entire gazelle in mid-sprint – that’s the thing. Many people believe they can be like Soros, and some will point to their process as proof of their seriousness. Unfortunately, merely showing up each day and being diligent in the execution of a process won’t make them the next world-beating macro player. Sometimes the deciding factor is what’s in your gut. Or the pains in your back. Sharpe ratios don’t measure this, nor do pedigrees, years of experience, credentials after one’s name or the address at which one keeps an office. Because it’s animal, and, as such, it’s also unpredictable.

APNew York has banned a unit of PriceWaterhouseCoopers from accepting certain consulting work from New York-regulated firms for two years after charging the "Big 4" accounting firm with removing a warning about financial information from countries facing U.S. sanctions. The state's Department of Financial Services says the firm's Regulatory Advisory Services Group caved to pressure from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi to strip wire transfers of information that would have triggered sanctions compliance alerts. In June 2013 BTM paid a $250 million fine for violating U.S. sanctions. "When bank executives pressure a consultant to whitewash a supposedly 'objective' report to regulators — and the consultant goes along with it — that can strike at the very heart of our system of prudential oversight,” DFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky said in a statement. DFS accuses PwC of having first acknowledged that data manipulation would comprise the integrity of an ongoing "historical transaction review," but then deleting the information anyway.   "At the Bank’s request, PwC ultimately removed the original warning language from the final HTR Report the Bank submitted to regulators and, in fact, inserted a passage stating the exact opposite conclusion: '[W]e have concluded that the written instructions would not have impacted the completeness of the data available for the HTR and our methodology to process and search the HTR data was appropriate,'” DFS says. One PwC director, now retired, warned against doing a more thorough review of the wires because doing so would "open up a whole other can of worms,” DFS says. PwC has also agreed to pay a $25 million fine. Here's the full consent agreement:  PwC Full Agreement  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Murad SezerThe NAHB's August housing market sentiment stats crossed the wires well ahead of their scheduled release at 10:00 a.m. ET. The headline index climbed to a seven-month high of 55 in August from 53 in July. This was stronger than the 54 expected by economists. "After leaping decisively into positive territory in July, home builder sentiment pulled another surprie in August," wrote CNBC's Diana Olick in a post published at 9:45 a.m. ET. "Confidence among U.S. homebuilders rose in August to the highest level in seven months, showing the industry is making more headway after weakness earlier this year," reported Bloomberg's Vince Golle in a story published at 9:50 a.m. ET. “As the employment picture brightens, builders are seeing a noticeable increase in the number of serious buyers entering the market,” said the NAHB's Kevin Kelly. “However, builders still face a number of challenges, including tight credit conditions for borrowers and shortages of finished lots and labor.” The index of future sales climbed two points to 65 during the month. "Altogether, this returns the level of homebuilder sentiment to where it stood in Q4 of last year, prior to the adverse weather that affected the sector earlier this year," said Barclays' Michael Gapen. "Homebuilder sentiment stands only three points below where it stood a year ago. History suggests that the index of future single-family sales is a reasonable gauge of start activity six months ahead. We view this report as consistent with our outlook that improved sentiment should support start activity in the coming quarters." Markets continued to move higher after the report was released.

Flickr / MIKI YoshihitoWASHINGTON (AP) — A child born in 2013 will cost a middle-income American family an average of $245,340 until he or she becomes an adult, with families living in the Northeast taking on a greater burden, according to a report out Monday. Those costs — food, housing, childcare and education — rose 1.8 percent over the previous year, the Agriculture Department's new "Expenditures on Children and Families" report said. As in the past, families in the urban Northeast will spend more than families in the urban South and rural parts of the U.S., or roughly $282,480. When adjusting for projected inflation, the report found that a child born last year could cost a middle-income family an average of about $304,480. The USDA's annual report, based on the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, found families were consistent in how they spent their money across all categories from 2012 to 2013. The costs associated with pregnancy or expenses accumulated after a child becomes an adult, such as college tuition, were not included. In 1960, the first year the report was issued, a middle-income family could spend about $25,230, equivalent to $198,560 in 2013 dollars, to raise a child until the age of 18. Housing costs remain the greatest child-rearing expense, as they did in the 1960s, although current-day costs like childcare were negligible back then. For middle-income families, the USDA found, housing expenses made up roughly 30 percent of the total cost of raising a child. Child care and education were the second-largest expenses, at 18 percent, followed by food at 16 percent. Expenses per child decrease as a family has more children, the report found, as families with three or more children spend 22 percent less per child than families with two children. That's because more children share bedrooms, clothing and toys, and food can be purchased in larger, bulk quantities. ___ Online: The USDA's full report: http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/CRC/crc2013.pdf USDA's "Cost of Raising a Child" calculator: http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/tools/CRC_Calculator/default.aspx Copyright (2014) Associated Press.

REUTERS/Aly SongA tourist jumps inside an upside-down house at Fengjing Ancient Town, Jinshan District, south of Shanghai, on May 1. Don't bet against the U.S. bond market rally anytime soon. Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and record low bond yields in Europe, have unleashed a stampede into Treasuries, knocking benchmark 10-year yields to 2.30 percent, a 14-month low at one stage on Friday. They ended the week at 2.34 percent. The U.S. bond rally, which accelerated on Friday after Ukraine claimed its artillery destroyed part of a Russian armored column that entered its territory, has shown earlier market calls from some leading bond investors, such as DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach, to be on the money. "We are in a market environment now that is largely beyond fundamentals," said Chris Orndorff, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management in Pasadena, California, a leading U.S. bond manager that has about $470 billion in assets. "The falling yield levels are a reaction to panic, as U.S. Treasuries continue to play the role that they have always played, the favorite asset in a flight-to-quality environment." U.S.-based funds that invest primarily in Treasuries have attracted inflows for four straight weeks, accumulating more than $4.5 billion of new investor cash in that run, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The four-week moving average of flows shows investors moving into this sector at the fastest pace in nearly six months. Meanwhile, more speculative investors such as hedge funds, have reversed their recent short positions in 10-year Treasury futures and options. The latest week's Commitments of Traders data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculators were net long by about $374 million after being net short by $616 million the week before. The latest bull run in bonds has defied expectations of those traders and investors who had bet on U.S. interest rates rising this year as the U.S. jobs picture improved and the U.S. Federal Reserve paved the way to tighten policy in 2015. Bond yields could decline further if, as expected, Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterates her concerns about underlying weakness in the labor market in her speech next week at a global central bankers conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "She is going to remind us why they would maintain a dovish policy stand," Jeffrey Rosenberg, chief investment strategist for fixed income at New York-based BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager with $4.3 trillion in assets. Bond analysts and managers interviewed by Reuters on Friday said the 10-year yield could fall another 10 to 15 basis points. They didn't rule out it reaching the 2 percent level in the current rally. Still, they warned that if global political tensions ease, the safe-haven demand for U.S. bonds will subside. Then, the 10-year yield could snap back to 2.60 to 2.70 percent. Foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries has also grown in recent weeks because the yields on German and other European government bonds continue to fall. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield has been running more than 1.30 percentage points above the yield on 10-year German Bunds since the beginning of July. This premium is the biggest since June 1999, which was before the euro was introduced. Some big bond investors like Pimco's Bill Gross, who manages the world's biggest bond fund &lt;pttrx.o&gt; with $223 billion in assets, see Treasuries gains tied closely to the movement in Bunds. That's because the consistently wide spread between the two makes it an attractive carry trade for European-based investors to sell Bunds and buy Treasuries. With the euro declining, investors would also get a positive currency benefit. This week, data showing anemic second-quarter growth across the eurozone, suggesting the 18-nation block is close to deflationary conditions. The European Central Bank is expected to fight aggressively to prevent deflation from taking root by providing more easy money, which in turn could see European bond yields fall further. "European government bond pricing is reaching an inflection point, which will force the ECB to act,” said Larry Jeddeloh, chief financial officer of the TIS Group, which produces the Market Intelligence Report. This week, the German two-year yield &lt;de2yt=rr&gt; fell into negative territory while its 10-year yield &lt;de10yt=rr&gt; dropped below 1 percent for the first time ever. Italian and Spanish yields fell to record lows in step with their German counterparts. [GVD/EUR] "This pulls global allocation into the United States," BlackRock's Rosenberg said. He said that Asian investors dealing with a stuttering Japanese economy and fears of slower growth in China had been shifting more money into U.S. debt. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds &lt;jp10yt=rr&gt; ended Friday at 0.51 percent, 1.83 percentage points below the 10-year U.S. yield.   (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Burns and Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload

 Google isn't afraid to shell out a boatload of cash for the right acquisition. Just ask the smart thermostat company Nest, which it bought earlier this year for $3.2 billion. In 2014 alone, Google has already made upward of 20 acquisitions.  According The New York Times' David Gelles, CEO Larry Page uses the "toothbrush test" to determine whether a company is worth buying. He'll ask, "Is this something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?" Instead of diving into the nitty-gritty of cash flow and earnings, Page cares about usefulness and long-term investment and benefits. Nest might not be reeling in a ton of money right now, but Google sees it as an entry point to a potentially gigantic new market. Nest's smart thermostats and smoke detectors use complex tech to solve simple problems that people have on an everyday basis. Toothbrush test: Passed.  Like many other tech companies, Gelles points out, Google doesn't depend as frequently on big banks to decide whether a major merger or acquisition is worth it.   "Larry will look at potential deals at a very early stage,” Google’s VP of corporate development, Donald Harrison, told Gelles. "Bankers can be helpful, but they’re not necessarily core to the discussions." Once Google does acquire a company, it works hard to integrate it into the "Googley" culture while still leaving room for autonomy. Nest, for example, still has an independent management team and doesn't share its data with its parent company.  Read the full New York Times piece here.   FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Rick WilkingWorkers install an oil well.In this week's Barron's cover story, Sandra Ward profiles Schlumberger, the oil and gas equipment and services provider, which is set to see profits grow.  Schlumberger, Ward notes, is also focusing more of its efforts on the North American energy market, where smaller rivals Halliburton and Baker Hughes derive more of their profit, with Schlumberger's North American operating profit margin topping that posted by Halliburton during the second quarter.  Schlumberger, the 29th largest component of the S&amp;P 500 with a market cap of $138 billion, is trading at a historical discount to its future earnings expectations, writes Ward. Bill Herbert of Houston-based investment-banking firm Simmons &amp; Co. told Ward that for Schlumberger, "The value proposition has never been higher," with Hebert seeing the shares gaining more than 30% to $145 per share.  Ward also highlighted some of the company's cost-cutting and capital-return goals: "Overall, the company is targeting a return of capital of 20% by 2017, up from the current 16%. Capital spending is expected to drop to 10% of revenue from the more typical 12%, which will free up more cash flow to return to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Indeed, Schlumberger expects to convert 75% of earnings to free cash flow, up from the current level of 55%. An estimated 60% to 65% of that will be given back to shareholders." Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard told Ward that Schlumberger isn't focused on being the best-run company in its industry, but said, "We have the potential to be the best-run company in the world, and that's what we are trying to do."

Thomson ReutersPedestrians and drivers wait to cross the road of the Gibraltar International airportLONDON (Reuters) - British holidays airline operator Monarch Group is set to cut the airline's workforce by a third with the closure of its charter operations as it moves to reinvent the carrier as a scheduled European budget airline. Monarch, privately-owned by the Mantegazza family, said it would scrap its charter flights business to focus on the scheduled European market, repositioning itself as a smaller rival to Europe's biggest low-cost carriers Ryanair  and easyJet . A source familiar with the situation said that Monarch could reduce its staff numbers by around a third, cutting 1,000 jobs, and reduce aircraft numbers to 30 from its current 42 as part of the shake-up plans. Monarch said last week it aims to complete its transformation to become a scheduled European low-cost carrier by the time a new narrow-bodied aircraft fleet of 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8s start entering service in 2018. Monarch, based at London Luton airport and with a route offering focused on holiday destinations, ordered the 30 new Boeing jets last month, ditching its current supplier Airbus . But the company, which promoted its former airlines unit managing director Andrew Swaffield to be new group chief executive in July, said in a statement on Monday that the strategic review initiated by new management and relating to operations, ownership and financing had still not yet been completed. "That review is ongoing and further announcements will be made upon its conclusion or as otherwise appropriate," it said. Low-cost airlines are better weathering a European short-haul market where rising capacity is putting pressure on prices than their more traditional rivals. Monarch said last December the environment was tough and would get tougher. In addition to easyJet and Ryanair, Monarch also competes against low-cost carrier Norwegian , which has expanded at London's Gatwick airport and Spain's Vueling, owned by British Airways parent IAG , amongst others. It said it would move to scheduled-only flying from summer 2015, with scheduled only flights already accounting for 85 percent of its operations. Its charter operations include some long-haul flights to Florida and the Caribbean as well as to Goa in India, and Gambia. Monarch Group also operates tour operating and holiday companies under the Cosmos, Avro and somewhere2stay brands, whose flying needs would be met by Monarch services and third party airlines, the company said.

REUTERS/Sukree SukplangA hen warms her chicks in the rain on the outskirts of Bangkok June 17, 2012. Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl, Thailand's largest meat and animal feed producer, said on Monday its business was booming, especially after it was approached by McDonald's Holding Co (Japan) to supply chicken products after a food scare in China. Strong demand for exports, especially from Japan and Russia, had boosted domestic meat prices and that could help the company post revenue growth of 15 percent this year, higher than its target of 10 percent, said president and CEO Adirek Sripratak. "We have received orders from McDonald's. Strong demand for exports helped push up chicken prices and the company will move orders from the domestic spot market to export to customers," he told Reuters in an interview. Some regional companies including Japanese firms have turned to Thailand to supply chicken after Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, was accused in a TV report of having improperly handled meat and using expired food. McDonald's has said it had shifted business to Thailand, boosting purchases from existing suppliers McKey Foods Services (Thailand) Ltd, a unit of Keystone Foods, and Cargill Thailand. "The industry is short of supply and we've got a full order book now as people are asking us to accelerate our shipping after the China food scare," Adirek said. CPF has also been contacted by companies in Russia to supply meat products after the country banned imported meat from the European Union, the United States and other countries, he said. "Russia is very keen to buy chicken from us. They contact us every day and they want to secure food supplies," Adirek said, although he would give no detail on the value of orders. CPF, owned by billionaire Dhanin Chearvanond's Charoen Pokphand Group, is looking for opportunities to buy assets in high-growth emerging markets to achieve its annual revenue growth of 10-15 percent in the next five years, Adirek said.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — In a business where patience is part of the process, Kentucky bourbon makers are making a big bet by stashing away their largest stockpiles in more than a generation. To put it in bartenders' lingo: Distillers are putting up the tab for millions of rounds of bourbon years before they are even ordered. The production poses an inherent risk, but hitting the moment right — a big supply meshing with big demand — could mean a serious payday for companies big and small. Missing the target would leave bourbon makers awash with supply and leave future production in question, particularly for craft distilleries that have seen a surge in popularity. "People keep asking us, 'When will the bubble burst?'" said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association. For most in the business, the answer is not anytime soon. Large companies are banking on continued international demand from places such as China and a culture in the U.S. that currently has a taste for bourbon, which has to be aged at least two years in new charred oak barrels. "We are busier than I ever could have imagined," said Chris Morris, master distiller at Brown-Forman Corp., producer of Woodford Reserve and Old Forester bourbons. Last year, Kentucky distilleries filled 1.2 million barrels of bourbon — the most since 1970, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. Inventory has topped 5 million barrels for the first time since 1977, the group said. Production has surged by more than 150 percent in the past 15 years in Kentucky — home to 95 percent of the world's bourbon production. "For many, many years, bourbon was considered a Southern gentleman's drink," said Jimmy Russell, the longtime master distiller at Wild Turkey. "Now bourbon's become a worldwide drink." The last time the industry spiked production in the 1970s, distillers ended up with a glut when demand went in a tailspin. Back then, the industry had grown stale and many consumers switched allegiance to vodka, Scotch and other spirits. "You had the same old brands, you were pretty much on autopilot," Morris said. Now, distillers are constantly dabbling with premium small-batch offerings or putting new twists on recipes and flavors and companies are looking to real-time data from the digital world. Sales trends and developments are tracked in markets worldwide. The numbers are crunched to make the best educated estimate of future consumer demand for a product that takes years to mature.Straight bourbon whiskey ages a minimum of two years, though the average maturity is four years or older. Many popular super-premium brands age six years or longer, which are the toughest to stock in bars, restaurants and liquor stores. "Bourbon as a category is on fire," said Bill Thomas, a Washington, D.C., bar owner whose establishments include Jack Rose Dining Saloon. "Every week, there's stuff that's out of stock." Expansions have occurred at Jim Beam, Evan Williams, Wild Turkey, Maker's Mark, Buffalo Trace and Woodford Reserve. Global liquor giant Diageo PLC recently announced plans to build a new distillery in Kentucky. Microdistilleries are getting a foothold in the state. Every drop of bourbon is precious for producers trying to keep up with demand. "If they had more, they could sell it right now," said Fred Noe, Jim Beam's master distiller and descendant of Jacob Beam, who set up his first Kentucky still in 1795. The disparity between supply and demand has put extra pressure on the distilleries. In early 2013, Maker's Mark caused a backlash when it announced it was cutting the amount of alcohol in each bottle to stretch its whiskey supplies. The brand known for its red wax seal quickly scrapped the idea. In the U.S., total revenues for bourbon and Tennessee whiskey reached $2.4 billion last year, a 10.2 percent increase, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Volume was up nearly 7 percent to 18 million cases, it said. The two spirits claimed 34 percent of the U.S. whiskey market in 2013, putting it ahead of the Canadian, Scotch, blended and Irish whiskey categories. The industry lumps bourbon and Tennessee whiskey into one category. Both are produced in the same way with similar ingredients, but Tennessee whiskeys are charcoal mellowed before going into the barrel to age, while bourbon isn't. Exports of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever in 2013, the council said. "It's never been like this in my lifetime," said Bill Samuels Jr., who retired after a long career as the top executive at Maker's Mark, the brand started by his parents. "It doesn't feel like a fad. It feels like a legitimate trend." Copyright (2014) Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaPeople looks at Mercedes-Benz cars during the the 15th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition in Shanghai April 21, 2013.SHANGHAI/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Mercedes-Benz has been found guilty of manipulating prices for after-sales services in China, the official Xinhua news agency reported, adding to pressure on foreign carmakers in the world's largest auto market. Brands including Volkswagen AG's &lt;VOWG_p.DE&gt; Audi, BMW &lt;BMWG.DE&gt; and Mercedes-Benz are cutting prices for new cars and spare parts in an effort to appease Chinese regulators which have accused some of them of anti-competitive behavior. Daimler, the parent company which makes the luxury Mercedes-Benz cars, said on Monday it was cooperating with authorities and declined to comment further. An array of industries, from milk powder makers to electronics firms, has come under the Chinese regulatory spotlight in recent years as the government intensifies its efforts to make foreign companies comply with 2008 anti-monopoly legislation. Anti-trust regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), launched an investigation into the auto industry following domestic media complaints that foreign carmakers were overcharging Chinese customers for vehicles and spare parts. The Xinhua report, which cited regulators, made no mention of possible penalties for Mercedes. The regulator can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's China revenues for the previous year. Analysts at JP Morgan said the willingness of the German manufacturers to lower prices in China reduces the possibility of high fines but in the longer term could hit profitability. Mercedes-Benz recently announced that it would reduce prices on some spare parts by an average of 15 percent and BMW said it would cut prices by an average of 20 percent, JP Morgan said. Audi has also said it will cut prices but did not specify by how much. In the longer run, forcing European carmakers to lower the price of spare parts and imported vehicles could see margins in China normalize to levels currently seen in Europe, JP Morgan said in a note earlier this month. "We believe that this might happen gradually over the next five years or more," the brokerage said, adding it sees an impact on earnings per share of around 3 percent for German carmakers. They said that if the price of spare parts and services fell 20 percent in China, Daimler and BMW's pretax profit would take a hit of around 1 percent in 2015, and Volkswagen's pretax profit would fall by just under 3 percent.  The Jiangsu Province Price Bureau found evidence of anti-competitive practices after raiding Mercedes-Benz dealerships in the eastern coastal province and an office in neighboring Shanghai, Xinhua said in its report on Sunday. The European Chamber of Commerce in China has expressed concern that European companies were being unfairly targeted and were discouraged from appealing against fines. "The European Chamber has received numerous alarming anecdotal accounts from a number of sectors that administrative intimidation tactics are being used to impel companies to accept punishments and remedies without full hearings," it said last week. Critics however say automakers have too much leverage over car dealers and auto part suppliers in China, enabling them to control prices. The Xinhua report said the cost of replacing all the spare parts in a Mercedes-Benz C-Class could be 12 times more than buying a new vehicle, citing a report from the China Automotive Maintenance and Repair Trade Association. Earlier this month the NDRC said it would punish Audi and Fiat SpA's &lt;FIA.MI&gt; Chrysler for monopoly practices. Executives at Toyota Motor Corp &lt;7203.T&gt; said the government was looking into the auto parts policies of its premium brand, Lexus. Chinese media reported last week that Audi, the best selling foreign premium car brand in China, would be fined around 250 million yuan ($40.7 million). Foreign car brands, all of whom operate in China through joint ventures with a local partner, have been fiercely competing to up their share in the world's largest car market. Daimler has said that it wants to boost China sales of Mercedes-Benz cars to more than 300,000 cars a year by 2015, while Audi expects China to make up 40 percent of its sales by 2020.  (Additional reporting by Edward Taylor and Andreas Cremer; Editing by Erica Billingham) FREE AppDownload

TMZApple could release a new version of its Lightning iPhone and iPad cable with the iPhone 6 that can be plugged into a USB port either way up. The cable would remove the need to fiddle around to find the right way up to plug the iPhone’s USB cable into a computer. The USB Promotor Group, which governs USB standards, recently announced the completed design for a new “type C” reversible USB plug that could be inserted either way up but would not be compatible with current USB ports. A patent filed in 2013 by Apple, however, describes “reversible or dual orientation USB plug connectors” that can be plugged into any standard computer USB port to “reduce the potential USB connector damage and user frustration.” The connector design would be compatible with any current and future full-size USB ports on computers and other devices. Recent unconfirmed leaked pictures appeared online supposedly showing an iPhone 6 USB Lightning cable with the reversible connector design. Reversible USB port on the new Lightning cables! pic.twitter.com/bhVKjK3xKl Accessory manufacturer Buffalo, which makes storage devices and networking gear, sold a USB hub in 2012 that could support the insertion of USB cables in any orientation, but this would mark the first USB cable to support a similar orientation agnostic insertion into any standard USB port. While a new cable is not certain, Apple’s switch to the Lightning cable from the 30-pin dock connector used on the iPhone and iPad since its inception until two years ago made the end that plugs into the iPhone reversible.

Dr. Ed's BlogLast week, there certainly was lots of bad news about the global economy. The Eurozone’s latest production and GDP numbers suggest that the lackluster recovery of the past year isn’t just stalling but may be turning into a recession. I think that the Ukraine crisis explains this downbeat turn of events. If it passes, as we expect it will soon, then the region’s weak recovery should resume. In addition, starting next month, the ECB will inject more funds into the Eurozone’s banking system with its “targeted longer-term refinancing operations” (TLTRO), as I discussed last week. (The details of the program were outlined in June 5 and July 3 press releases.) The drop in Japan’s Q2 real GDP wasn’t a surprise. Much of the stimulus of Abenomics was more than offset by the hike in the sales tax on April 1. There is already chatter that more stimulus will be required. There was a surprise in China’s July report on social financing. It plunged, suggesting a significant slowdown in China’s economy. I am not convinced. Let’s have a closer look at some of the key indicators in the major overseas economies: (1) China. Social financing during July was remarkably weak. It fell from $321 billion during June to $44 billion last month. That was the slowest pace of lending since October 2008. Bank loans dropped from $175 billion during June to $63 billion during July. We think this is a one-month aberration. However, it may be that lending to residential property builders has hit a brick wall as a glut of housing units is depressing prices. In any event, on a y/y basis, bank loans are up 13.4% y/y, in line with M2 growth.  (2) Japan. Real GDP fell 6.8% (saar) during Q2 in Japan. That’s after increasing 6.1% during Q1. Despite Abenomics, real GDP was unchanged on a y/y basis, and up just 2% in nominal terms. Private consumption plunged 18.7% during Q2. It’s not obvious why it wasn’t obvious to the government that mixing massive monetary and fiscal stimulus with a major tax hike was akin to stepping on the accelerator and the brakes at the same time. It’s a sure way to wind up in a ditch. Even capital spending fell 12.3%. Despite the weaker yen, exports fell 1.8%. It’s dismal. (3) Eurozone. It’s also dismal in the Eurozone. That’s evident in bond yields, which continue to fall to historical lows. The German 10-year government bond yield fell below 1.0% for the first time in history, down to only 0.97% on Friday. Perhaps the biggest shock last week was that Germany’s real GDP fell 0.6% (saar) during Q2. But that’s after it rose 2.7% during Q1, which was boosted by mild winter weather. However, weakness in the rest of the Eurozone is weighing on the region’s biggest economy and biggest exporter. So is the Ukraine crisis, which has been a slow-motion train wreck so far.

Shutterstock.comBANGKOK (Reuters) - The lawyer of a Japanese man suspected of having fathered at least 12 babies using Thai surrogate mothers submitted DNA samples to Thai police on Monday in a bid to clear his name. The 24-year-old man, identified by police as a Japanese national who traveled frequently in and out Thailand, has not been charged. His Thai lawyer, Kong Suriyamonthon, said his client wants to clear up the allegations against him. "It's a DNA sample, yes. He wants the truth to be known," Kong told reporters on Monday, adding that he did not know whether his client would return to Thailand. He declined to confirm his client's whereabouts but said the DNA samples had come from Japan. Police Colonel Naiyawat Padermchit said at least 12 babies tested were fathered by the same man. Thailand has been gripped by surrogacy scandals in recent weeks following allegations that an Australian couple had abandoned their Down Syndrome baby with his Thai birth mother taking only his twin sister back to Australia with them. Earlier this month, Thai police discovered nine surrogate babies with their nannies and a pregnant surrogate mother at a Bangkok apartment, dubbed the "baby factory" by media. Police later said they had found more babies, all suspected of being fathered by the Japanese businessman. "We have intelligence that he is a rich man and his father gave him a lot of money. We also know he took children from Thailand to Cambodia," Thailand's Interpol director, Apichart Suriboonya, told Reuters, adding that police had found no link to human trafficking. Thailand's military government, which took power in May, has given preliminary approval for a draft law to make commercial surrogacy a criminal offense.

The 10-yr government bond yield in Japan is now around 0.5%, following an almost linear decline that started in 2006. The only way to rationalize buying 10-yr JGBs at 0.5% is believing that Japan will have a deflationary environment over the next decade and/or the central bank will absorb (or even monetize) the bulk of new issue bonds. Moreover, these record low yields will do some serious damage to the Government Pension Investment Fund, which invests two thirds of its assets into local bonds. A significant portion of the population will tap the pension fund in the next 10 years. There will also be pain for Japan’s insurance industry that now faces a nasty asset/liability mismatch.

Enzo Figueres/ Getty ImagesWall Street banks could desert Britain if the country decides to leave the European Union, senior figures in the industry have reportedly said. Some major institutions are believed to be already drawing up plans to move activities abroad amid concerns that the UK is drifting further away from the EU. Most US and Asian banks currently run their main European operations from the UK, which gives them a passport to provide services across the EU. But if the UK left the European Union, it is believed to be unlikely foreign banks based in London would carry on receiving the same rights. According to the Financial Times, US-based banks including Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are considering Ireland as a favourable alternative location for business currently conducted in London. One senior UK-based manager at a Wall Street bank was quoted as saying: “I’m frankly looking at moving some activities to Ireland. “I think the Irish central bank and government would welcome this.” Citigroup employs around 2,500 people in Ireland, while JP Morgan and Bank of America each employ 500 staff there. Ireland has become attractive to foreign banks due to its low corporate tax rate, English-speaking workforce, and eurozone membership. Other possible destinations for US-based business, should Britain leave the EU, could include Frankfurt or Paris. According to TheCityUK, a lobby group, more than 250 foreign banks are hosted by the UK and they accounted for around a third of last year’s £71<U+2009>billion financial services trade surplus. Last month, foreign banks based in London warned the Treasury about the possible consequences of an EU exit. In a submission, the Association of Foreign Banks said Britain should stay in the union because it would remain in a position to influence EU rules. A spokesman for the group said: “If Britain withdraws from Europe, then foreign banks may reassess their reasons for maintaining their business in Britain and may decide to continue their business elsewhere.”  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA price sign at a Dollar General store in Arvada, Colorado(Reuters) - Discount retailer Dollar General Corp &lt;DG.N&gt; offered to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc &lt;FDO.N&gt; for $8.95 billion, trumping an offer by Dollar Tree Inc &lt;DLTR.O&gt;.  Dollar General's offer of $78.50 per share in cash represents a premium of 3.2 percent to Family Dollar's Friday close. Family Dollar had 113.9 million shares outstanding as of July 5, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Family Dollar's shares rose 5.1 percent to $80 before the bell, while Dollar General's shares rose 11 percent to $63.90. The deal, at an enterprise value of $9.7 billion, was proposed in a letter to Family Dollar's board on Monday. Dollar Tree offered last month to pay $8.5 billion, or $74.50 per share in cash and stock, for Family Dollar, representing an enterprise value of about $9.2 billion. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General.  Dollar General said a deal would create a "preeminent small-box retailer," with nearly 20,000 stores in 46 U.S. states and sales exceeding $28 billion. Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said the "financially superior" offer would provide Family Dollar's shareholders with a substantial premium and immediate liquidity. Dollar stores have struggled in a weak U.S. economy as Wal-Mart Stores Inc &lt;WMT.N&gt; and other large retail chains chase penny-pinching consumers by offering more items priced at $1 or less. Most Family Dollar stores are in low-income neighborhoods. Its presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States, where it mainly sells lower-margin food and household products.     Dollar General also said it was prepared to divest up to 700 retail stores to get regulatory approval for the deal. This is the same percentage that Dollar Tree proposed in its deal to buy Family Dollar. Dollar General said it had financing from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Global Markets Inc for the deal, including $305 million termination fee payable to Dollar Tree.              (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Devika Krishna Kumar in Bangalore; Editing by Kirti Pandey) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeWASHINGTON August 18 (Reuters) - Establishing a tax domicile abroad to avoid U.S. taxes is a hot strategy in corporate America, but many companies that have done such "inversion" deals have failed to produce above-average returns for investors, a Reuters analysis has found. Looking back three decades at 52 completed transactions, the review showed 19 of the companies have subsequently outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, while 19 have underperformed. Another 10 have been bought by rivals, three have gone out of business and one has reincorporated back in the United States. Among the poorest performers in the review were oilfield services and engineering firms, all from Texas. Among them was the first of these companies to invert, McDermott International Inc &lt;mdr.n&gt;, which moved its tax home-base to Panama in 1983. Drugmakers are dominating the latest wave of inversions and most of them have outperformed the benchmark index. So far in 2014, five U.S. pharmaceutical firms have agreed to redomicile to Ireland, Canada or the Netherlands. Deals that have not been completed were excluded from the review. It is impossible to know how the companies might have fared in the market had they not inverted. Innumerable factors other than taxes influence a stock's performance, and no two of these deals are identical, complicating simple comparisons. But the analysis makes one thing clear: inversions, on their own, despite largely providing the tax savings that companies seek, are no guarantee of superior returns for investors. The deals basically involve a U.S. company initially forming or buying a foreign company. Then the U.S. company shifts its tax domicile out of the U.S. and into the foreign company's home country. The name "inversion" comes from the idea of turning the company upside down, making a smaller offshore unit the new head and the larger U.S. business the body. Companies that do these deals typically promise shareholders will benefit. But aside from stock price underperformance by many, inversions can also impose substantial up-front tax costs. When a deal occurs, investors must recognize any taxable capital gains on their stockholdings. These costs are not taken into account in the study as they differ for each shareholder and don't apply in some cases. "For some companies, these inversions are really smart business moves. For others, they're less smart ... You don't always know if it's going to work," said James Hines, professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan and one of a handful of academics who have closely studied these deals. Corporations that invert say they are only seeking to pay the lowest tax rate they can get, noting this is what shareholders would expect them to do. Inversion was pioneered as a strategy by oilfield companies that reincorporated chiefly in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Britain. Most have lagged the S&amp;P500 since their inversions were completed: McDermott by 85 percent; Rowan Cos Plc &lt;rdc.n&gt; by 35 percent; Transocean Ltd &lt;rig.n&gt; by 18 percent; among others. These oilfield stocks also largely underperformed narrower Thomson Reuters and Dow Jones oil and gas equipment and services sector indexes, looking as far back as index data allows. McDermott did not reply to questions sent to the company. Transocean did not respond to requests for comment. A Rowan spokeswoman referred questions to the company web site. It said the company's 2012 UK redomiciling "was designed to enhance shareholder value," while putting Rowan closer to customers and North Sea operations and enabling it to stay competitive "with the effective tax rates of its global competitors, most of which are domiciled outside the U.S." Beyond oilfield services, the inversion strategy has been used by a half-dozen U.S. insurance firms, with half of them outperforming and the rest either acquired or out of business. White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd &lt;wtm.n&gt;, managed from Hanover, New Hampshire, has outpaced the S&amp;P500 by 248 percent since reorganizing in 1999 as a Bermuda corporation, for example. A spokesman for the company said it had no comment. The analysis, using Reuters data and analytics, measured simple share price performance against the S&amp;P 500 index using two benchmarks - the date when each company completed its inversion deal, and the date when each deal was announced. With only four exceptions, the inverted companies that were still in business since doing their deals either uniformly underperformed or outperformed on both benchmarks. For instance, U.S. engineering and construction group Foster Wheeler AG &lt;fwlt.o&gt; announced in November 2000 - when its stock was worth about $45 per share - that it was inverting to Bermuda. The deal, a statement said, was "expected to benefit Foster Wheeler and its stockholders for several reasons." Since the announcement, the company's stock has lagged the S&amp;P 500 by 50 percent; since the deal was concluded in May 2001, it has trailed the index by 83 percent. Foster Wheeler agreed in January 2014 to be acquired by UK rival Amec Plc &lt;amec.l&gt; for about $32.69 per share in Amec stock and cash at the time. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Foster Wheeler spokesman Scott Lamb said the company dealt with weak markets, several problematic projects and a major debt restructuring after it inverted to Bermuda. It recovered and so did its stock price, but the 2008 economic downturn, he said, brought "an extended period of moderate demand and intense competitive pressure. These conditions have adversely affected the performance of all of the companies in this sector." Also, in the past decade, he said, the company's revenue and employment base have largely shifted out of North America. Concern is growing in Washington about inversions. President Barack Obama has criticized a "herd mentality" by companies seeking deals to escape U.S. corporate taxes. Of the 52 inversions and similar redomiciling deals done since 1983, 22 have occurred since 2008, with 10 more being finalized and many more said to be in the works. Following recent deals by major companies such as Medtronic Inc &lt;mdt.n&gt;, bankers and analysts have said that another burst of deals is waiting to be unveiled in September. Congressional action this year is unlikely with Republicans so far opposing Democrats' proposals, analysts said, though the Obama administration has been weighing executive actions. For instance, the White House may announce tighter restrictions on federal government contracting with inverted companies, said Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities in Washington in a research note last week. Inversions have a firm legal basis. The government has been writing rules on them for 30 years. But they are complex and risky and some major proposed deals have recently unraveled. On August 6, for example, after months of internal debate and public criticism from politicians, U.S. retailer Walgreen Co &lt;wag.n&gt; said it would not reincorporate in Europe. It was considering using its purchase of Europe's Alliance Boots Holdings &lt;abn.ul&gt; for such a maneuver. Drugmaker Pfizer Inc &lt;pfe.n&gt; and advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc &lt;omc.n&gt;, U.S. leaders in their industries, have also walked away from planned inversions in recent months because they couldn't reach deals with their targets. No two inversions are identical and they have changed shape along with evolving U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules. One appeal of inversions is putting foreign profits out of the IRS's reach. Another is "earnings stripping," in which a foreign parent lends to a U.S. unit, which deducts the interest to shrink its U.S. income for tax purposes, while the foreign parent books the interest at its home country's lower tax rate. Inversion destinations have lower corporate tax rates than the United States. The top U.S. rate of 35 percent is among the world's highest. Add state and local taxes and, in much of the United States, the headline corporate rate is even higher. Still, many U.S. companies pay far below that headline rate because of abundant loopholes that give businesses, especially big ones, a lower effective tax rate. Inverting usually does not mean a U.S. company fully decamps from home. In most cases, it means opening a foreign office, but leaving core operations in the United States. Inversions underwent a major change in 2004 when the IRS adopted a rule - Section 7874 of the tax code - that slapped new limits on the deals, making them harder to do. Pre-7874 deals were sometimes known as "naked" or "self-help" inversions. One example was Helen of Troy Ltd &lt;hele.o&gt;, an El Paso, Texas consumer products group that sells hair dryers, kitchenware and other goods. In 1994, the company set up a Bermuda holding company and simply transferred its tax domicile into it. Since then, Helen of Troy has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 219 percent. The company declined to comment. Deals like this continued through 2002, involving groups as diverse as manufacturer Ingersoll Rand Plc &lt;ir.n&gt;, which has outperformed the S&amp;P500 by 103 percent since inverting in 2001, and underwear maker Fruit of the Loom. An Ingersoll Rand spokeswoman declined to comment. Fruit of the Loom inverted to the Cayman Islands in 1998-1999. Three years later, it was bought out of bankruptcy by Berkshire Hathaway. In 2004, Section 7874 was adopted in response to naked inversions. It set two tests for whether an inverted company is recognized as foreign or domestic by the U.S. government. Since Section 7874, most inversions, though not all, have involved the acquisition of actual, operating foreign companies, with the costs, opportunities and challenges that can present. For instance, Cleveland, Ohio's Eaton Corp Plc &lt;etn.n&gt;, a maker of power management products, in 2012 moved its tax domicile to low-tax Ireland by acquiring Cooper Industries, itself an inverted company that reincorporated from the United States to Bermuda in 2002 and then Dublin in 2009. "The acquisition of Cooper was a strategic decision to add scale and breadth to our global electrical business ... The acquisition of Cooper was transformational for our business," said Eaton spokesman Scott Schroeder in emailed comments. When the deal was announced, Eaton Chief Executive Sandy Cutler said it would shave about $160 million off Eaton's annual tax bill. He said business motivations, not tax reductions, were the key reasons for the transaction. Eaton's effective tax rate in 2013 was only 0.6 percent, down from 2.5 percent in 2012 and from 12.9 percent in 2011, said Eaton's 2013 annual report to federal regulators. "The lower effective tax rate for 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to the effects associated with the acquisition of Cooper, along with greater levels of income in lower tax jurisdictions and additional foreign tax credit utilization," Eaton said in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Despite the tax savings, Eaton has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 5 percent since completing the Cooper deal in November 2012. But, measuring from the day when the deal was announced in May 2012, Eaton's share price has outperformed the index by 9 percent, Reuters data showed. The first U.S. drug company in the 52 to complete an inversion was biotechnology group Xoma Corp &lt;xoma.o&gt;, which shifted to Bermuda in 1998. Thirteen years later, the company returned its tax domicile to the United States, saying in a statement it wanted to reduce exposure to possibly adverse tax legislation and to come back to a more familiar legal system. Xoma has posted losses since 2010 and, despite returning to California, has underperformed the S&amp;P500 by 95 percent since it went to Bermuda. A spokeswoman said Xoma had no comment.

Volvo2014 Volvo XC90GOTHENBURG Sweden (Reuters) - With headlights shaped like Thor's hammer and space for a humidity-controlled cigar case, Volvo's new cars are sporting luxury features and designer glitz to catch the eye of the booming Chinese market and shed their safe-but-dull skin. The XC90 SUV launch on Aug. 26 will be make or break for a company moving into a premium market dominated by German rivals. It will be the first fully new car under Chinese parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co [GEELY.UL], which bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co &lt;f.n&gt; four years ago, and heralds the revamp of its entire product range to more upmarket models. It follows a five-year, $11-billion investment program aimed at doubling Volvo sales, which for two decades have been stuck at around 400,000 cars a year. It hopes the new line will reverse declining sales in the U.S., but must persuade customers to spend up to 100,000 euros for a brand many associate with functional family cars. "Prices will be the same level as competitors like the Germans," said Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson. "Customers should not expect to buy them cheaper than an Audi." The new cars aim to reconcile strategic tensions in the 87-year-old carmaker, which remains wedded to Scandinavian understatement, greenness and an emphasis on safety, but also wants to make swanky cars that will seduce affluent Chinese customers away from the likes of BMW &lt;bmwg.de&gt;, Mercedes-Benz &lt;daign.de&gt; and Audi &lt;vowg_p.de&gt;. The XC90 has anti-collision detectors that will brake the car on dangerous left turns, and the company says its four-cylinder engine is an industry beater in terms of combining power with low emissions. But the first preview of the car, for a small group of journalists at the company’s headquarters in Gothenburg, shows design is to the fore. The seven-seater features a sleeker logo, and inside are Scandinavian touches of light wood and leather, a tablet-like, touch-screen control panel, and a minimalist dashboard. The head of the gear stick is Swedish crystal. "This is Scandinavian design without the bling-bling," said chief marketing head Alain Visser. "The XC90 is a signal that we are here as a premium brand. It is a signal that other models are going in that direction." The XC90 will be followed next year by a S90 sedan, aimed at the United States and China, which could become the world’s biggest premium market by 2020. 'TOO SCANDINAVIAN' Last year Volvo owner Li Shufu was reported to have called Volvo’s interiors "too Scandinavian", and the rollout of the new cars will show that Volvo has accepted many of the Chinese demands to make its cars more appealing to China’s wealthy. "The Chinese wall has thawed," said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at UBS. Li’s influence can be seen in the XC90 four seater, which is aimed at Asian executives with chauffeurs. Product strategy head Lex Kerssemakers recounted how Li visited the Gothenburg headquarters about two years ago and sat in the back seat of a XC90 prototype. "It doesn’t work. I don’t have enough space," he complained. Kerssemakers told his team to take the front seats and put them in the rear, and take everything out so they could redesign it to create as luxurious an environment as possible. "That would never have happened without a Chinese owner,” he said. "Two or three times a year he comes, he has an opinion,” Kerssemakers said. "Why don’t you try this, try that? Especially interior wise ... this is what my friends like, and they are rich customers." CEO Samuelsson denied there had been any split, and said the company had been largely given a free hand. "Our traditional values are getting more and more important," Samuelsson added. "The one-baby policy makes safety important." He said the company would also emphasize in China, where poor air quality sometimes makes headlines, that its vehicles come fitted with air filters to keep the fumes outside. ACID TEST Some analysts say taking on established German premium brands is a risky proposition for Li and Volvo. "It is unproven as to whether customers will accept Swedish understatement as a luxury," said Patrik Strom, assistant professor at the University of Gothenburg. "But it is also risky to become too closely associated with China and lose that Swedish identity." Sales figures will be the acid test. Without new models, sales in the United States slipped 10 percent to 61,000 last year - roughly half of what they were a decade ago. Samuelsson is now aiming at selling 100,000 cars a year by 2016. "The U.S. is very critical," Samuelsson said. "Without a strong position in the U.S., we are not a global brand, we are not a premium brand. That has to work." Volvo also sold 61,000 cars in China last year, but that was a jump of nearly 50 percent. Samuelsson said sales could beat its 80,000 target this year. Volvo has for decades been hampered by currency headwinds in times of dollar weakness against the euro and Swedish crown as the cars it sells in the United States are made in Europe. Samuelsson said the company would start exporting cars from China next year, mainly to the United States. U.S. production has been discussed but was currently off the table, he added. Volvo CFO Hans Oscarsson said moving into the premium range would eventually allow Volvo to reach margins of around 8 percent, compared with 1.6 percent last year. But for the moment, investment was the main task, so far funded in-house. "The owners have been pretty patient with Volvo," said Oscarsson. "We are not profit-maximizing this company. We are not stressed by quarterly reports. Of course we could have done better results, but that would sacrifice the long term.” (Editing by Will Waterman) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA farmer walks through a paddy field at Tannaurah village in PunjabBEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it regretted World Trade Organisation members had failed to reach an agreement on simplifying global customs rules, a breakdown it said could damage multilateral trade. India last month torpedoed a global deal to standardize and streamline customs regulations, known as "trade facilitation", after it demanded more freedom to subsidize and stockpile food grains than is allowed by WTO rules. Many WTO member states, including the United States, voiced frustration after India's demands led to the collapse of what was the first major global trade reform pact in two decades. WTO ministers had already agreed to the global reform of customs procedures in Bali last December, but were unable to overcome India's last-minute objections by the July 31 deadline. "China hopes all parties can quickly resolve differences and find a way out of the impasse," Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told reporters at a monthly press briefing, adding it was "worried" about the possible negative impact on multilateral trade and Doha round negotiations, referring to the latest round of talks. "China ... has called for all related parties to push forward the implementation of the Bali ministerial conference and work out a balanced, practical work plan within this year to lay a foundation for wrapping up the Doha round," Shen said. India has said it believed it could convince other members that its need for more leeway on food subsidies was legitimate, and has said a deal could be signed as early as September if its concerns were addressed. Most diplomats had expected the pact to be rubber-stamped, marking a unique success in the WTO's 19-year history which, according to some estimates, would add $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the world economy. India calls these estimates highly exaggerated. India blocked the text because it wanted more attention paid to its concerns over WTO limits on stockpiling of food which will ultimately hit its subsidized food distribution program, the world's largest, targeted at nearly 850 million people.

REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachMore sellers than buyers, basically.Property prices in the U.K. can't go on rising forever — and now they're not. A survey of 90% of the market by Rightmove, a real estate price tracking company, shows that real estate prices fell 2.9% in August, the second consecutive down month this summer. Prices fell nearly 6% in the overheated London market. That news dovetails ominously with the rumors of "panic selling" in London as owners try to cash in on their overpriced houses at the very top of the market. While prices generally cool off in summer when fewer people feel like moving, according to Rightmove, the decline was the worst the agency has ever seen: ... this is the largest decrease ever recorded by Rightmove at this time of year, and a lead indicator of a slower market in the second half of 2014. The price fall has been exacerbated by London recording a 5.9% drop, which is the largest of three consecutive monthly falls. Here are the data in charts.  Rightmove Rightmove Rightmove Rightmove Rightmove's staff and estate agent network had several explanations for the news: They attributed the declines to the season, the Bank of England's talk about raising interest rates soon, and buyers being priced out of the market.

Wikimedia CommonsSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Calling the top in financial markets is never easy. Asian stock and bond markets may appear frothy at their near-record levels after a multi-year rally, but global investors are still betting on a mix of healthy returns and history to juice up their profits. Six years since the global financial crisis spurred a relentless pursuit of yields, Asian stock markets are at record highs, bond yields have tumbled to pre-crisis lows and companies are raising huge amounts of cheap equity and debt. Brisk corporate earnings growth, fed by a global thirst for the region's exports of cars and electronics goods and robust domestic consumption, has further burnished Asia's appeal and kept funds focused on ripe pickings. "I would not at all subscribe to the idea that markets are expensive and now's the time to get out," said Julie Dickson, a portfolio manager at Ashmore Investment Management in London, a fund with $75 billion in assets worldwide. "And if you do that, you are going to be potentially losing out on some very compelling opportunities for growth in the next 3 to 5 years and possibly longer, particularly in China and Korea." Indeed, triggers for a correction, which seems overdue, have come and gone - ranging from geopolitics such as the Ukraine-Russia tensions or economic ones such as an Argentine debt default or periodic threats of a rise in U.S. yields. Other regions have cooled off in the past two months. There were outflows from U.S. high-yielding bonds and equity funds, European equities have fallen sharply, and foreign cash has moved away from Latin American and European equity markets. Asia has remained the exception, almost caught in a virtuous cycle where company earnings are surpassing expectations and bond yields offer a decent cushion for risk. Asian stocks &lt;.MIAPJ0000PUS&gt; are up 137 percent in just under six years. Equity markets in India, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and most other countries are well above their 2008 peaks, with some at record levels. Earnings have spurred much of these heady gains, underwritten by an economic recovery led by domestic consumption and, more recently, exports. Second quarter earnings have so far on average been growing at 25-to-30 percent over the previous year. And despite a slowing in China's frenetic growth rates, economists on average expect Asia to grow at 3 times the pace of the developed world this year - a big lure for investors grappling with uneven global growth. The skyrocketing markets have understandably raised the risk of a sudden and sharp reversal, but those putting more money in the game make a persuasive case for staying on. "You have to look at what earnings growth companies have delivered. And earnings in Asia over the past year or so have been broadly supportive of the move up in the market," said Andrew Gillan, Asia ex-Japan equities head at Henderson Global Investors. Henderson has $4.5 billion in Asia-Pacific equities. No one's sure what will touch off a correction or even which part of the market will sell off first. "We know that at some point the party is over but as a portfolio manager you are paid to look for opportunities for your clients," Hans Goetti, head of Asian investments at Banque Internationale a Luxembourg (BIL) in Singapore, told Reuters TV. One likely trigger would be a spike in U.S. yields, possibly in early 2015 in anticipation of a rate rise by the Federal Reserve, which would cause high-yield Asian bonds to be sold. Even there, the high-yield market in Asia has been holding up well, barring some discrimination among investors on primary issues. For instance, Indonesian firm Berau Coal &lt;brau.jk&gt; postponed a dollar bond offering citing adverse market conditions. JPMorgan's JACI high yield index &lt;.JPMACIGN&gt; for Asia is now around 7 percent, and that compares with a 5.71 percent yield on the U.S. high yield benchmark &lt;.JPMHYDOM&gt;. Yields on such risky Asian debt were below that for the U.S. counterparts in 2008, which means Asian bonds aren't as overvalued now. According to Citi's Asian strategist Markus Rosgen, emerging Asia market valuations are below historic peaks, with prices on average 16 percent below the October 2007 peak and yet earnings per share now 29 percent higher than the previous peak in mid-2008. Prices in Latin America and emerging Europe are also significantly below peaks, but the earnings growth is absent there. In the United States, earnings are above the peak but so are prices. This higher risk premium in Asian equity prices gives investors more wiggle room, should markets turn when interest rates rise, Rosgen wrote recently. That doesn't stop policymakers from worrying. In a recent interview with the Central Banking Journal, India's central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, who had also previously warned of a crisis ahead of the 2008 crash in markets, said investors were living on hope and prayer that markets wouldn't unwind messily. "They put the trades on even though they know what will happen as everyone attempts to exit positions at the same time."
