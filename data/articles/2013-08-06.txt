flickr/75144752@N00Does your job make the world a better place? In a Payscale survey published Tuesday, workers who earn a lot but don't believe their jobs help the world tend to work in sales, finance, or tech. These people aren't "healing sick people, helping underprivileged people, educating our children, providing a public service," notes Payscale economist Katie Bardaro. "Instead they are doing normal white collar professional tasks that help their firms to generate revenue either directly or indirectly." For these "low meaning" jobs, Bardaro said there isn't much that employers can do to increase the meaning behind their employees work because this value is "driven by society." "That being said, if workers are struggling with the low job meaning in their current role, employers might be able to offer other outlets for job meaning, such as corporate sponsored volunteer work," Bardaro said.  Below is Payscale's list of the highest-paying jobs where workers don't feel they're making a difference: 1. Senior Counsel Typical national median pay: $176, 900 % reporting high job meaning: 31% 2. Product Marketing Director Typical national median pay: $135,400 % reporting high job meaning: 36% 3.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is examining the way E*Trade Securities prices and sends customer stock orders to an affiliate, E*Trade said in a quarterly regulatory filing on Tuesday. The notice was the first from the discount broker's parent, E*Trade Financial Corp, to disclose that a regulator is investigating trading practices and procedures between the firm and its market-making affiliate. FINRA notified it of the exam on July 11, E*Trade said. E*Trade has previously said it was reviewing its order-routing practices and procedures following a complaint from former board member Kenneth Griffin about whether it was meeting its obligations to ensure "best executions" for customers. Griffin, the founder of hedge fund Citadel LLC, which runs a competing trade execution business, earlier this year resigned from the E*Trade board and sold Citadel's 9.6 percent stake in the discount broker. E*Trade also said in the filing that banking regulators and federal securities regulators "may initiate investigations" into its historical order-routing practices. Those could lead to monetary penalties, cease-and-desist orders and private lawsuits from customers that could each "materially and adversely affect" its broker-dealer business, the company said. E*Trade said at the end of June that it was taking a $142.4 million impairment charge to close G1 Execution, and plans to sell the unit within six months. FINRA, a private regulator delegated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee brokerage firms, is investigating order routing practices at both E*Trade and G1 Execution, the filing said. Separately, E*Trade said that a customer named John Scranton has filed a suit that seeks class-action status in the Superior Court of California alleging that E*Trade Securities failed to make good on promises involving options trades. He accused the firm of misrepresenting on its website that it would automatically exercise options that were profitable by 1 cent or more on their expiration date. E*Trade said it "continue to defend itself vigorously" against Scranton's suit, which was filed on April 30, 2013. An E*Trade spokesman said in an email that he could not comment beyond the filing on the lawsuits or the sales process for G1 Execution. (Reporting by Jed Horowitz; Editing by Bob Burgdorfer)
Hey Paul StudiosThis past weekend, we learned that Fonterra is in serious trouble after they announcedÂ  they'd shipped contaminated products to Asia. Many people learned this week that Fonterra is the world's biggest dairy exporter. We recently featured Fonterra's dairy index, which tracks the milk and milk product trade, on our list of "hipster indicators" since it functions as an offbeat but representative indicator of worldwide economic activity. With everyone talking about both Fonterra and the global economy these days, we revisit the list today. Within its inherent funkiness, we believe, lie data that can shed light on lingering macroeconomic questions. How fast is Asia falling? How fast is the U.S. rising?
In announcing the deal on Monday, the 49-year-old multibillionaire founder and chief executive ofÂ Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc told Post staff in an open letter: "I won't be leadingÂ The Washington PostÂ day-to-day." Bezos will stay inÂ SeattleÂ where he will focus on his day job as head of the world's largest online retailer. He promised to preserve the paper's journalistic tradition, while driving innovation in a business facing unprecedented challenges as advertising revenue and readership decline. But tax experts said on Tuesday that playing a limited role at the Post could prevent Bezos from realizing individual income tax benefits that he might be able to claim as a result of owning The Post. For the first six months of the year through June, the Post's newspaper division reported an operating loss of $49.3 million, compared with a loss of $33.2 million during the same period last year. Such losses could relieve Bezos of some tax burdens. For tax purposes, a business owner or partner can deduct from income any losses from operating that business. By reducing taxable income, losses can reduce a business owner's overall tax bill. It was unclear how Bezos - the world's 19th richest person with a fortune of $25.2 billion, according to ForbesÂ magazine - would manage his new businesses for tax purposes. U.S. individual tax returns are private, meaning that he has no obligation to disclose publicly how he might use the newspaper purchase to his tax advantage. His 2012 compensation from Amazon was $1.7 million; he owns nearly 19 percent of Amazon. NEARLY 10 HOURS A WEEK In an effort to root out tax shelters,Â CongressÂ passed tax rules that prevent an individual from claiming business tax breaks without playing an active role in the business itself. Before the law, "people would be passive investors in a business, the business would throw off losses and they would use depreciation losses to offset other income," saidÂ David Kautter, managing director of the Kogod Tax CenterÂ at theÂ Kogod School of BusinessÂ atÂ American University. To realize the business tax benefits, Bezos may need to spend 500 hours a year in managing The Post's business, tax experts said, citingÂ Internal Revenue ServiceÂ rules. That comes to an average of 9.6 hours a week. Such rules may influence Bezos' participation at the Post. An Amazon spokesman for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment. A Post spokeswoman declined to comment. The law is murky in defining what qualifies as business activity for tax breaks, and subject to interpretation, but it generally includes making decisions and telling people what to do, experts said. "A lot of it depends on how you count hours ... It's a fair amount of time you have to spend, it's not inconsequential," saidÂ Bill Smith, a managing director withÂ CBIZ MHM, an accounting firm. The paper's operations will be kept separate from Amazon.com. The deal is notable also because Bezos bought The Post's assets, not shares inÂ the Washington PostÂ Co, which would not entitle him to business tax breaks. The Post's parent company will be selling some additional publishing assets, but no real estate, into a limited liabilityÂ DelawareÂ company set up for Bezos. A 'NICE PROBLEM' POTENTIALLY Bezos faces the same tax considerations as anyone buying a business, accountants said. "This is designed so that he can save on taxes," said David Lifson, an accountant withÂ Crowe Horwath LLP, who advises wealthy clients. "It's no different than if he was buying a hotdog stand." For Bezos to start receiving tax benefits, he will need to add up the value of all assets, ranging from phones to printing presses. That figure will determine how much he can deduct from his income taxes as the assets get older and lose value through depreciation and amortization. In the years ahead, Bezos can realize tax savings if he pours his own money into rejuvenating the business model of The Post, the seventh largest daily newspaper in theÂ United States. Most money an individual spends on operating a business can be deducted. Should The Post start making money, that would be taxed to Bezos as ordinary business income. "It's a nice problem to have," Kautter said. (Reporting by Patrick Temple-West; Editing by Howard Goller, Kevin Drawbaugh and Bernard Orr)
Twitter.com/ClaytonCohnClayton CohnThe Securities and Exchange Commission said today that it halted a United States Marine Corps veteran's Chicago-based hedge fund fraud that was targeting current and former military service members.Â  The SEC alleges that ex-Marine Clayton A. Cohn, 26, raised about $1.8 million from 24 investors for hedge fund firm Market Action Advisors by lying about his fund's investing performance and success as a trader. According to the SEC's complaint [.PDF], Cohn allegedly showed investors that his fund hadÂ year-to-date returns of 180%. Â The SEC, however, says his fund never generated any returns.Â  As for his personal trading success, Cohn allegedly told a potential investor that he turned $50,000 from his parents in $1.5 million trading, the complaint shows. Â The SEC says that his brokerage account P&amp;L statements show he made very little.Â  What's more is the SEC's complaint also alleges that Cohn used some of that investor money he raised to pay rent for a Los AngelesÂ mansion, a luxury sports car, gambling and "extravagant" tabs at high-end nightclubs.Â  On Cohn's personal website, which features pictures of him in his Marine Corps dress blues, he describes himself as "reminiscent of a Bret Easton Ellis character with a touch of Jim Cramer and a dash of Justin Timberlake."Â  He also writes that he loves his family, friends, freedom and country. Â  Cohn spent four years in the Marine Corps as an infantry machine gunner, according toÂ his LinkedIn profile. He served two combat tours in Iraq. Â He was awarded a Purple Heart during his first deployment, his profile states. Here's the SEC's full press release. Â You can see the complaint here [.PDF]Â  The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained an emergency court order to halt a hedge fund investment scheme by a former Marine living in the Chicago area who has been masquerading as a successful trader to defraud fellow veterans, current military, and other investors. The SEC alleges that Clayton A. Cohn and his hedge fund management firm Market Action Advisors raised nearly $1.8 million from investors through a hedge fund he managed.Â  Cohn lied to investors about his success as a trader, the performance of the hedge fund, his use of investor proceeds, and his personal stake in the hedge fund.Â  Cohn only invested less than half of the money raised from investors and instead used more than $400,000 for such personal expenses as a Hollywood mansion, luxury automobile, and extravagant tabs at high-end nightclubs.Â  He used his lavish lifestyle to carefully contrive the image of a successful trader and investor, when in reality he lost nearly all of the money invested through the hedge fund.Â  In order to cover up his fraud and continue raising money from investors, Cohn generated phony hedge fund account statements showing annual returns exceeding 200 percent. âCohn lured fellow military and other investors into his hedge fund by portraying himself as a successful trader who generated massive returns for his investors,â said Timothy L. Warren, Acting Director of the Chicago Regional Office.Â  âBut Cohnâs hedge fund investors didnât have a chance to make a profit since he never invested most of their money and promptly lost the portion he did invest.âÂ  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Cohn targets mostly unsophisticated investors and has solicited friends, family members, and fellow veterans to invest in his hedge fund.Â  Cohn controls a so-called charity called the Veterans Financial Education Network (VFEN) that purports to teach veterans how to understand and manage their money.Â  Cohn has touted his Marine Corps pedigree in VFEN press releases and encourages veterans to find âa money-manager who is both trustworthy and knows what he is doing.â VFENâs website identifies Cohn as a money manager who âmanages millions of dollars.â According to the SECâs complaint, Cohn managed his hedge fund Market Action Capital Management through his investment advisory firm Market Action Advisors, which is registered with the state of Illinois.Â  Cohn solicited investments by falsely claiming that he had major success as a personal trader and invested $1.5 million of his own money in the hedge fund.Â  He also misrepresented that an accounting firm would audit the hedge fundâs financial statements. The SEC alleges that Cohn had a record of trading losses, invested no more than $4,000 of his own money, and absconded with far more money for his personal expenses.Â  The audit firm named by Cohn never agreed to audit the fundâs financial statements.Â  Cohn continued to deceive investors after their initial investment by issuing account statements that showed annual returns of more than 200 percent for 2012 when the hedge fund actually lost money. Â  The SECâs complaint charges Cohn and Market Action Advisors with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.Â  The court granted the SECâs request for emergency relief including a temporary restraining order and asset freeze.Â  The SEC further seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and financial penalties from Cohn and Market Action Advisors.Â  The SECâs investigation was conducted by John J. Sikora, Jr. and Jason A. Howard, and the litigation will be led by Jonathan S. Polish.
When President Barack Obama travels, he rolls with a pretty thick crew of reporters. One such reporter is Bloomberg's Hans Nichols who tweeted this picture of his lunch on Air Force One. According to Nichols, lunch was an "Asia shrimp salad." Dessert looks like a pretty generous slice of cheesecake.

APIn his housing policy speechÂ in Phoenix today, President Barack Obama sounded two discordant notes on whether people should rent or buy their homes. He talked about the need for people to be responsible and only buy homes if they can afford to: In the run-up to the crisis, banks and the government too often made everyone feel like they had to own a home, even if they werenât ready. Thatâs a mistake we shouldnât repeat. Instead, letâs invest in affordable rental housing. And letâs bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rent for working families. Now, what could have made people feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren't financially ready? Maybe it was partly because politicians kept saying things like this: Iâve come to Phoenix to talk about that second, most tangible cornerstone at the heart of middle-class life: the chance to own your own home.Â A home is supposed to be our ultimate evidence that in America, hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. I think of my grandparentsâ generation. After my grandfather served in World War II, this country gave him the chance to go to college on the GI Bill, and buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. A home was a source of pride and security. It was a place to raise children, put down roots, and build up savings for college, or a business, or retirement. Americans want to be middle class, and if we keep telling them that homeownership is the "most tangible cornerstone" of middle classness, and the best available evidence of whether you've worked hard and been responsible, they're going to keep wanting to buy houses. Why not instead emphasize that rentingâthat is, not taking all the money you have in the world and putting it into a highly leveraged real estate investmentâis a perfectly valid life choice, even for people leading prosperous, middle-class lives? Obama (and other politicians, since promoting the cult of homeownership is a decidedly bipartisan vice) should take a page from Related, a developer of luxury rental apartment buildings in New York City. KVNYRelated owns a complex in midtown Manhattan called MiMA. MiMA is extremely expensive; a two-bedroom apartment there can rent for as much as $16,000 a month. And the ad campaign for MiMA is extremely douchey, as you can see in the photo at left. I love this douchey ad campaign. I love it because it insists that a rental apartment can be not just "decent," as Obama said twice in his speech today that rentals should be, but aspirational. If renting an apartment is good enough for the extremely hot, extremely wealthy couple in this ad, it must be good enough for the middle class. Obama did allow today that an affordable and thriving rental market is important not just for Americans who "canât yet afford" to buy a home, but also for those who "don't want to."  But he also framed his discussion of the rental market as creating "options for families who arenât yet ready to buy," as though not wanting to own a home must result from a temporary incapacity that you will eventually overcome. And he gave the speech in front of a backdrop that said "A Home To Call Your Own." It's OK to be a renter. I'm a renter and I'm glad to be a renter. And if we convince middle-class Americans that it's OK to rent, there may be less demand for the sort of high-leverage mortgages that fueled the housing bubble in the first place.

REUTERS/Henny Ray AbramsIf you thought Carl Icahn "liked" Bill Ackman a couple weeks ago when he told CNBC's Scott Wapner that betting against him on Herbalife made him $250 million, well now he must really, really like him.Â  Icahn was on Fox Business Network via the phone moments ago telling anchor Liz Claman that he has made $500 million on his Herbalife long position. Yes, a half a billion dollars. "I don't like to talk about it, but yes we made $500 million," Icahn told Claman. Â  Icahn and Ackman are long-time rivals. In fact,Â it's so bad that NYCÂ waiters know to never seat these two next to each otherÂ at a restaurant.Â Their rivalry began with a feud in 2004 and it's only intensified over the past year over Herbalife. Â  Back in December, Ackman publicly declared that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalifeâa multi-level marketing company that sells nutrition products. Ackman believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" and that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to investigate it and shut it down.Â  Just weeks after Ackman disclosed his position, Icahn snapped up a long position. Â He admitted at the CNBC Delivering Alpha conference last month that the fact that he doesn't like Ackman was one reason why he decided to take a look at investing in the company in the first place.Â  After it was disclosed that Icahn was long the stock, Ackman and Icahn brawled on live TV on CNBC's "Halftime Report." Â  "I'm telling you he's like a crybaby in the schoolyard. I went to a tough school in Queens, you know, and they used to beat up the little Jewish boys. He was like one of the little Jewish boys crying ..." Icahn said.Â Icahn also said he thinks Ackman will be the victim of theÂ "mother of all short squeezes."Â  Icahn bought even more shares of Herbalife after that spat on live TV. According to securities filing data compiled by Bloomberg, Icahn Associates owns 16,966,485 shares, or a 16.46% stake in Herbalife.Â  Since December 18, the trading session before Ackman confirmed his short, shares have risen more than 56%.

(Reuters) - After a particularly rough June, two of the $2.25 trillion hedge fund industry's best known managers, David Einhorn and Daniel Loeb, each saw their main funds gain almost 3 percent last month, according to an investor. The investor was not authorized to speak publicly about the private funds' returns. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital rose 2.8 percent in July, sending yearly returns to 10.3 percent. Loeb's Third Point Offshore fund rose 2.9 percent in July, boosting yearly returns to 15.9 percent. A levered version of Loeb's flagship fund, called Third Point Ultra, climbed 4.1 percent last month. It had gained 23.6 percent for the year through July 31. In contrast, William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management lost 2.2 percent in July, largely because of its bearish bet on Herbalife, whose stock rose steeply over the month. For the year, the fund is up 3.8 percent, according to investor sources. June was a bad month for many hedge funds, particularly bond-focused funds. But early indications show that most funds bounced back in July, in part because of the strong performance in stocks. Overall, hedge funds in July rose by 1 percent, according to early estimates by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while the S&amp;P 500 stock index climbed 4.95 percent. For the year, funds have risen roughly 3.6 percent on average, according to the Bank of America data, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 18.2 percent through July.
REUTERS/Vincent WestStocks fell again today. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories:
Ex-governor Eliot Spitzer (D) has his first union endorsement in his race for New York City Comptroller. Azi Paybrah of Capital New York thinks the endorsement is about a double layer of spite: the Civil Service Employees Association hates Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), and Cuomo and Spitzer hate each other. This is the dominant theme in the 2013 races for both Mayor and Comptroller of New York City. People aren't backing the candidates they like. They're backing the opponents of the candidates they hate. A few weeks back, I wrote about the forces mobilizing behind Spitzer's opponent in the Comptroller race, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer (D). They're driven not by Stringer's awesomeness but by the various reasons they hate Spitzer: bankers are mad about his Wall Street investigations, health care workers are mad about his Medicaid reform initiative as governor, the teachers' union is mad about his efforts to expand charter schools, etc. In the mayoral race, the business and real estate interests that love Mayor Mike Bloomberg (I) have lined up with Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D). But they don't actually like her so much as they are terrified of what might happen if a true-believing lefty like Public Advocate Bill de Blasio (D) becomes mayor. Meanwhile De Blasio has accused his primary opponents, especially Quinn, of "aiding and abetting" the mayor, as though they were engaged in some criminal enterprise. That line works because his supporters are animated by their dislike of Bloomberg, and they resent Quinn for working so closely with him. Ex-Comptroller Bill Thompson (D)'s main electoral strength is that few people have a really good reason to hate him. That's why my money is on him to win the race: in an election defined by spite, the candidate least likely to be on the receiving end of spite is the frontrunner. If all that depresses you (and it should) you can at least look to one bright spot of agreement: Everybody hates Anthony Weiner.
Business Insider/Liz O'ConnorThe S&amp;P, which crossed the 1700 mark last week, shows no sign of slowing down. Goldman Sachs economist David Kostin predicts a 4% rise through year-end and 7% returns over the next 12 months. "We expect earnings growth of 11% for 2013 and 8% for 2014, supporting a continued market rally," he writes in a new letter to clients. Of course, with stocks at all-time highs, some seem to have nowhere to go but down. In his new US Monthly Chartbook, Kostin offers a list of the 40 stocks with the most downside relative to Goldman analysts' price targets. All face double-digit downsides with one stock potentially falling 40% before it's fairly priced.

With concerns of a Fed taper on the table, many are asking if the should sell bonds and buy stocks. But Vanguard's Fran Kinniry tells advisors to advise against this move for four key reasons. 1. "The short-term movements of the financial markets should not dictate a long-term investment strategy. Indeed, rash moves are rarely rewarded." 2. "Stocks have outperformed bonds over the past year, and even more dramatically since the depths of the 2008â2009 bear market. This has prompted investors to increase their exposure to stocks, and "as such, it may be an opportune time to rebalance, which would require directing new cash flow to bonds or selling stocks to buy bonds, as counterintuitive as that may appear." 3. Offer some data on the stock market to put it in perspective. For instance, "the S&amp;P 500 has risen 175% since its trough during the financial crisis. â¦While we are not predicting the next bear market or even a sharp pullback, it is worth emphasizing to clients that stock downturns are much more severe in magnitude than bond downturns." 4. "Even with the probability of loss, high-quality bonds, such as U.S. Treasuries, are one of the few asset classes negatively correlated with equity tail risk, making them among the best diversifiers of equity risk." Financial Advisors Are Struggling With K-1 Statements (The Wall Street Journal) Financial advisors are struggling to ensure that their clients have enough liquid assets to cover tax payments stemming from K-1Â  statements that often arrive right before the extended deadline to file returns. "As more investors diversify their portfolios with partnerships, their financial advisers are stuck with a growing summer headache: late Schedule K-1 statements," writes Aden Dale at The Wall Street Journal.Â  "Some would say it is a high-class problem...I call it the effluence of wealth," Henry Bragg, partner at Houston-based Horizon Advisors told the WSJ. "It can be, and most often is, an absolute cluster of inefficiency." Howard Marks Nails It In His Memo About 'The Riskiest Thing In The World' (Oaktree Capital) Oaktree Capital's Howard Marks is out with a new letter titled 'The Role of Confidence' in which he talks about the riskiest thing in the world. "I often say the riskiest thing in the world is widespread belief that thereâs no risk.Â  And certainly that was the prevailing condition in the pre-crisis years of 2005-07, as well as during the tech bubble of the late 1990s.Â  In both instances the âera of well-beingâ was followed by a significant economic slowdown and market decline. "A feel-good environment characterized by strong confidence creates pleasant current conditions but encourages dangerous behavior and an ascent (in the economy and the markets) from which a correction becomes inevitable.Â  In that way, the less confident attitudes of 2013 create a lackluster, less enjoyable environment, but also a preferable and more prudent base for the future.Â  (The wild card, as described in âDitto,â January 7, 2013, is that the actions of central banks to lower interest rates have caused even un-confident investors to engage in pro-risk behavior, setting the stage for the market declines of June and perhaps for additional pain in the future.)" Investors Beware Old-Fashioned Phishing (FINRA) The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued a new investor alert, warning them about imposters cold calling investors and posing as representatives of at least well-known brokerages. While internet phishing schemes had got more popular, FINRA is now saying some fraudsters have reverted to phone calls. "In this latest twist on phishing scams, fraudsters are cold calling investors claiming to offer information about certificates of deposit with yields well above the best rates in the market in an attempt to get potential victims to divulge their personal or financial account information. Armed with this information, the fraudsters may attempt to steal the person's identity or money from his or her account. FINRA is reminding investors who receive unsolicited telephone calls never to provide personal information or authorize any transfer of funds to any unknown person." Byron Wien: I Am Worried About The Second Half Of 2013 (Blackstone)  Wall Street analysts expect U.S. economic growth to finally pick up in the second half of the year and that this should help drive stocks higher. But Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien doesn't think so.Â  "It is unlikely that we are going to see better earnings if sales don't improve. Second-quarter sales are only expected to rise 1.25% over last year and full-year estimates are for a 2.75% increase.Â  If there is some pressure on margins from modestly higher labor costs, depreciation and energy prices, that meager level of revenue improvement may not be enough to keep margins from eroding.Â  It has been my view that profit margins are peaking and we should see if that observation is correct in the second half of 2013."

Results for the notoriously difficultÂ Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam are out. And only 49% of candidates passed. The curriculum, which consists of three levels, is widely considered to be the most difficult to attain by finance professionals (and it has its share of unbelievable horror stories). Fewer thanÂ 20% of candidatesÂ pass all three exams on the first go, and the average person takes four years to finish all three.Â  This year, the pass rate dropped below 50% for the first time since 2010. As finance as a field has grown, so too has the number of test-takers. But it appears the test has been getting harder to pass since its inception in 1963. Here's the historical pass rate.

Both have caused their share of investor headaches  Greeces outsized debt touched off the euro crisis in 2009 and led to a series of bailouts, while a sharp rise in Spanish borrowing costs drove the European Central Bank to announce an unlimited sovereign bond-buying program last year. For the first time in a long time, though, consumers and businesses in both countries are feeling more confident about the future. Feeling better isnt quite the same as doing well, but its a start. Positive change is starting to happen where it always does, on the margins. More than one in four adults are unemployed in both nations, but employment statistics are either improving or worsening more slowly than before. Meanwhile, a key indicator of manufacturing activity and confidence has been rising throughout Europe, even in the so-called peripheral countries of Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. The manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose in Greece, Italy, Spain and Ireland in June  and, with the exception of Ireland, hit heights last seen in 2011. Greece and Spain both continued to improve even further in July. Nervous investors have also stopped yanking their money out of the periphery, as they were doing for the past two years, Credit Suisses European Economics team noted in the latest edition of Peripheral Data Monitor, a monthly research note. The euro area economy is at the start of recovery, and it appears to be common to the weaker periphery as well as the stronger core, the team wrote in an early August note entitled, Inflection Point. Importantly, this recovery appears to have been driven by better fundamentals from within the euro area, rather than a response to stimulus from elsewhere in the global economy. Much like the recession that preceded it, the recovery is made in Europe. So whats the prognosis for the regions toughest turnaround cases? Better than you might think. Spain Counts on Exports Spanish wages are still falling, but exports are becoming more competitive as a result, making the economy look less bleak, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note entitled Spain: The Sun Also Rises earlier this month. Spain passed laws last year that made it easier to hire and fire workers and gave employers more flexibility on worker pay, but wages were already falling relative to other European countries long before that. In fact, after a decade of above-average nominal wages, Spanish pay has been below the euro area average since 2010. After adjusting for labor costs, Spains real effective exchange rate has dropped 10 percent since a peak in early 2008, Credit Suisse wrote. As a result, exports rose 7 percent in the first four months of this year. Credit Suisse economists indexed the export levels of four key European countries to their individual 2008 levels and found that Spanish exports have shown a healthier bounce since the depths of the crisis than the other three, including Germany, widely considered Europes export powerhouse. The Financialist On the flip side, with many Spanish citizens unemployed and the rest coping with falling wages, imports are down. As a result, Spains current account went into surplus in July 2012 for the first time since the inception of the euro in 1999. The current account balance has moved up and down since then, but it was positive for six of the last 12 months. It will take a true economic recovery before Spains ailing consumers feel confident enough to start spending again, Credit Suisse analysts said, but that day may not be far off. Inflation has been low, easing the blow of falling pay, while consumer sentiment is also improving, perhaps because unemployment declined slightly for the first time in two years last quarter. Joblessness remains at an eye-watering 26.3 percent, but Credit Suisse said the hemorrhaging is likely over in the hard-hit construction sector, where employment has fallen 60 percent since the Spanish property bubble burst in 2008.  Since labor reforms and falling wages have made hiring a more palatable proposition for employers, analysts said, GDP growth of even 0.5 percent might jumpstart employment growth. Spains troubled banking sector is still a concern. Spain has nationalized several ailing banks and established a bad bank that absorbed the worst loans and foreclosed properties as a condition of last years 41.3 billion bank bailout. But Moodys Investors Service noted late last month that Spains high unemployment rate and struggling real estate sector propelled the proportion of non-performing bank loans to 11.2 percent in May, up from 10.9 percent the previous month. Even before those numbers came out, Credit Suisse analysts had cautioned investors that bad loans would likely keep increasing in the coming months  and as a result, banks would likely continue tightening the lending spigot. But analysts also noted that since establishing the bad bank, good banks now have 50 percent fewer real estate sector loans and foreclosed assets on their books. The pace of annual nonperforming loan growth slowed at the end of last year to 20 percent from 30 percent the year before. In the first quarter, that rate slowed again to 10 percent, though Mays increase may undermine that trend in the second quarter, analysts said. Maybe a Greek-overy? Continuing problems in the Greek economy can make it difficult to see the bright spots. After six years of recession, Greek GDP is down nearly 25 percent from its 2007 peak, and unemployment is the worst in the euro zone at nearly 27 percent. As in Spain, Greeces current account deficit is narrowing in year-over-year terms, but unlike Spain, thats mostly because economic pain at home is reducing domestic demand  not because exports are growing  according to a late July report from the International Monetary Fund. The report suggested that the country could need an additional 11 billion in financing by 2015. But additional bailouts would likely mean additional austerity, and with Greeks already tired of the continuing economic pain imposed by the countrys creditors as a condition for assistance, anti-austerity protests have been frequent. Just last week, Athenians massed at the Acropolis to protest the layoff of 500 culture ministry employees. In June, one of the three parties that comprised a fragile governing coalition withdrew from government over a cost-cutting move to close a state television station. Whats more, key European leaders, including Germanys Angela Merkel, are growing impatient with yet another call for help from Greece. And yet, the IMF said the Greek economy could start growing again as early as next year if it receives the assistance it needs. Credit Suisse isnt as optimistic, but the banks economists believe real GDP should at least stop shrinking in 2014. The trend is already heading that way.  Economic output declined 5.3 percent year-over-year in the first quarter compared to last years 6 percent decline in the fourth quarter and 7.2 percent drop in the third. Businesses and consumers alike seem to agree that things are looking up. A closely watched indicator of consumer and business sentiment in the industrial, retail, construction and service sectors published by the Foundation for Economic &amp; Industrial Research, a Greek think tank, has been rising steadily, except for a tiny dip in June, and is now at its highest level since 2008. The unemployment rate appears to be hitting a plateau, and businesses have been hiring more workers than they are firing, Credit Suisse noted in the Peripheral Data Monitor note. Finally, bank deposit levels have also climbed 7 percent since the August 2012 nadir, a fact Credit Suisse attributed to the reduced threat of a euro breakup. In the end, government reforms will drive a Greek recovery as much as anything else. IMF officials said ongoing efforts to collect more taxes  that is, making sure tax officials press citizens to pay on time and in full  are critical, as are plans to trim the bloated public workforce by 150,000 by 2015. The Greek authorities have continued to make commendable progress in reducing fiscal and external imbalances, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a July 29 statement. However, progress on institutional and structural reforms, in the public sector and beyond, has still not been commensurate with the problems facing Greece. Greater reform efforts remain key to an economic recovery and lasting growth. The suffering is not over in the European economies that took the harshest blows during the financial crisis. But the bleeding is slowing, and could soon stop altogether. When that happens in the worst-off economies in Europe, the outlook for the whole region will become much, much brighter.
Sanjay Poonen has left his role as head of SAP's mobility division to lead VMwares End-User Computing unit, VMware announced today. He's replacing Boaz Chalamish, Poonen told Business Insider, and taking on a tough job at a VMware unit that's been spitting out executives like watermelon seeds. Poonen had been with SAP since 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile, and was best known as the face of SAP's mobile division, one of SAP's big growth areas. He was leading SAP's ambitious goal to reach 1 billion mobile users by 2015. Now, at VMware, he's got an equally daunting task: To convince IT professionals to use VMware's "desktop virtualization" software. This lets any device run Windows and corporate apps over a network connection, rather than as software installed on the device. VMware competes with Citrix in this area and has had a number of executives leading the charge. In 2012 it acquired a company called Wanova for an undisclosed sum. Wanova's tech became a new desktop product called Horizon Mirage launched earlier this year.  The CEO of Wanova, Sebastiano Tevarotto, stayed on as a vice president to lead the End-User Computing unit for a mere 10 months leaving in March, according to his LinkedIn profile.  CORRECTED: Chalamish had been the general manager of the unit since 2011, before the acquisition of Wanova. He is being replaced by Poonen. Chalamish had been with VMware since 2009 and is leaving VMware to become a venture capitalist funding Israeli companies, VMware confirmed. In an email with Business Insider, Poonen told us he was "very excited ... I see a huge opportunity to help extend the great brand of VMware from the data center to the desktop." Plus, he joked, "the best part is my commute doesn't change." (VMware's parking lot is across the street from the Palo Alto SAP office.) There's a lot of churn going on among VMware's execs since VMware's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, stepped in a year ago. Besides Chalamish, other recent departures include early employee Jerry Chen, who left his job as vice president of Cloud and Application Services to become a VC at Greylock Partners; Mike Clayville, former vice president of marketing for VMware's cloud who left to help Amazon build a new enterprise sales staff as vice president of worldwide commercial sales; and Tod Nielsen who had been leading VMware's platform-as-a-service cloud Cloud Foundry who became CEO of Heroku, the Salesforce.com-owned direct competitor. UPDATED: VMware sent us this statement: "Boaz Chalamish has been a key executive at VMware since he joined the company in 2009, first helping to create VMware's management business unit, then taking over as head of the company's end-user computing business in 2011. During this time, he has helped these emerging businesses achieve outstanding results to become strategic assets in helping to deliver on our company priorities of software-defined data center, hybrid cloud and end-user computing, including the successful launch of the VMware Horizon Suite in February 2013. Boaz announced internally in May that he would be leaving VMware to pursue his interest in the venture business with a focus on Israeli companies, and he will remain with the company through the end of August. We thank him for his leadership and many contributions and wish him well in his future endeavors." Correction: This story originally reported that Boaz Chalamish had only lead the unit for a few months. We apologize for the error.

Kristin Davis, a former hedge fund VP and former "Manhattan Madam" who provided call girls for Eliot Spitzer, has been arrested for selling prescription drugs, according to a press release from the FBI.  Davis, 38, a candidate for the New York City Comptroller running as a Libertarian, has been charged with four counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. U.S. prosecutors allege that on three different occassions earlier this year David sold hundreds of prescription pills, including oxycodone, to an FBI coooperating witness carrying a recording device, according to the press release. Here's the full release:  Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and George Venizelos, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), announced today the arrest of KRISTIN DAVIS, a candidate for New York City comptroller, on charges of selling prescription pills containing controlled substances, including oxycodone, for cash. DAVIS was arrested yesterday in Manhattan and is expected to be presented this afternoon in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: As alleged, Kristin Davis sold dangerous and highly addictive prescription pills to a known drug dealer on repeated occasions in exchange for cash. Prescription drug abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in this country, resulting in more overdose deaths than heroin and cocaine combined, and this office has a zero-tolerance policy toward anyone who helps to spread this plague at any level. FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos said: As alleged, Kristin Davis sold prescription pills not once, but rather four different times in four months to an FBI cooperating witness. This type of criminal activity is illegal for citizens, and is especially unbecoming for a person seeking public office in the City of New York. The FBI and our partners in law enforcement remain committed to investigate and bring to justice those individuals who illegally distribute prescription medicines for their own financial gain. According to the complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court and other information in the public record: On three separate occasions from January 2013 to March 2013, DAVIS sold hundreds of prescription pills containing amphetamine, alprazolam, zolpidem, and carisoprodol to a person she knew from prior purchases and sales to be a drug dealer. Unbeknownst to DAVIS, the person was a cooperating witness (CW) with the FBI and equipped with a recording device. During these sales, DAVIS was recorded saying that the pills she was selling were Ambien, Soma, and Xanax. On a fourth occasion, in April 2013, DAVIS arranged for another individual to sell approximately 180 oxycodone pills to the CW. Oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance, is a powerful painkiller with a high potential for addiction and abuse, and the active ingredient in OxyContin and Percocet. There is an illegal market for oxycodone, which is often used as a substitute for, or adjunct to, other illegal drugs, such as heroin. Amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance, is a psycho-stimulant, and the active ingredient in Adderall. There is an illegal market for amphetamine, often referred to as speed, as a substitute for, or adjunct to, other illegal drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Alprazolam, a Schedule IV controlled substance, is a psychoactive drug, and the active ingredient in Xanax. There is an illegal market for alprazolam, which is often used as a substitute for, or adjunct to, other illegal drugs, such as LSD, heroin or opiates. Zolpidem, a Schedule IV controlled substance, is a sedative/hypnotic drug, and the active ingredient in Ambien. There is an illegal market for zolpidem, which is often used as a substitute for, or adjunct to, other illegal drugs, such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy). Carisoprodol, a Schedule IV controlled substance, is a skeletal muscle relaxant, and the active ingredient in Soma. There is an illegal market for carisoprodol, which is often used in conjunction with painkillers and so-called date rape drugs. *** DAVIS, 38, of New York, New York, is charged with four counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. DAVIS is the sixth person arrested as part of an ongoing investigation conducted by the FBI, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and the U.S. Attorneys Office into the unlawful distribution of prescription drugs containing controlled substances in and around New York City. Thomas Rock was arrested on July 10, 2013, and charged with distributing and conspiring to distribute oxycodone and alprazolam. Eugene Kurochkin was arrested on July 11, 2013 for distribution of oxycodone, alprazolam, amphetamine, and zolpidem. Raoul Goldberger and Rebecca Temen were arrested on July 29, 2013, and charged with distributing and conspiring to distribute amphetamine, oxycodone, and vicodin. Erik Pichardo, who is referred to as Individual-1 in the complaint against DAVIS, has been charged with distributing oxycodone and is at large. In addition, the investigation also led to the arrest of Mark Decker on July 1, 2013, on charges of distributing cocaine and ecstasy. Mr. Bharara praised the investigative work of the FBI. Mr. Bharara also thanked HHS-OIG and NYPD for their assistance in the ongoing investigation. The case is being handled by the offices Narcotics Unit. Assistant United States Attorneys Kristy J. Greenberg, Daniel C. Richenthal, and Edward A. Imperatore are in charge of the prosecution. The charges contained in the complaint, and the other charges brought in connection with the ongoing investigation, are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
We've debated it endlessly here  is an MBA worth the investment for a career in finance? In the most recent episode of the Open Door interview series, hosted by finance career site OneWire, Ian Snow, the CEO of private equity firm Snow Phipps Group, weighs in. After earning a BA, with honors, in History from Georgetown University, Snows finance career took off, beginning with a job as a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers. He then went to work for Ripplewood Holdings, LLC, where he remained for ten years. In 2005, he co-founded Snow Phipps, a mid-market private equity firm, where he serves as CEO, Managing Partner, and Partner. Now for the crucial question: I didnt get an MBA myself," said Snow. "By the time I was at the point in my career where I should have gone to business school, I had progressed so far along that the opportunity cost I viewed as too high. Just because he didn't get one himself, though, doesn't mean Snow doesn't believe in the value of an MBA. "I think an MBA is an excellent choice for someone looking to switch careers, he says. Its a great networking vehicle. But I think theres no substitute for on-the-job training and experience. Snows interview also touches on the qualities he looks for in junior candidates when hiring.

Credit Suisse today downgraded IBM stock to an "underperform" rating, which amounts to a recommendation to sell. It predicts the stock will fall to $175. The stock is down about 2% to $191 thanks to the downgrade. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a research report: Organically we believe IBM is effectively in decline ... we estimate that overall IBM core organic growth will be -1.8% for 2013, and that software will grow at 1.9%. ... To be clear, we believe the company will deliver on the $20 EPS roadmap; despite this, we downgrade to an Underperform. He's referring to IBM's promise to deliver $20 earnings per share by 2015, a program internally called Roadmap 2015. Some IBM employees have told Business Insider that this promise is causing IBM to take drastic measures to control or reduce costs and that some employees call the plan "Roadkill 2015." For instance, IBM is laying off thousands of employees. Plus, IBM told some employees in its hardware divisions that they would have to take a week off of work with reduced pay, Bloomberg's Sarah Frier reports. Executives in the division will not be paid during the week at all, Frier reports. The furlough is an attempt to stop margins in the hardware business from a free fall. Sales in the Systems and Technology unit slid 11% to $3.76 billion in the second quarter compared to the year earlier quarter. Gross margins declined 12%. Garcha says he believes "The current exclusive focus on 'EPS based valuation is distorting." We reached out to IBM for comment and will update if we hear back.

"As always, remember history is a guide, never gospel," says stock market historian Sam Stovall. With that in mind, we consider the latest weekly market commentary from LPL Financial's Jeff Kleintop. "It has been a summer of love for the stock market," writes Kleintop. "As the temperatures heated up, so did the stock market. From June 24 to August 2, 2013, the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 9%, pushing stocks up about 20% for the year. The last time we saw stocks perform the way they have this year in both pattern and magnitude was 1967." Kleintop identifies 8 similarities between 1967 and 2013. Here's four: "It can be dangerous to look back selectively," warns Kleintop. "Of course, there are lots of differences between now and 46 years ago, and there is no assurance that stocks will continue to follow the 1967 pattern." Still, it's a fun exercise. "History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme," said Mark Twain. LPL Financial, Business Insider
REUTERS/Jayanta Dey Wall Street can cry if it wants, but its warehousing business is about to change, says a Morgan Stanley note out this morning. They're talking about the business that has been making headlines for the past few weeks. The New York Times accused Goldman Sachs of costing Americans $5 billion a year by making their aluminum warehouse clients endure long wait times to receive deliveries of the metal. The bank owns the Detroit-based Metro Metro International Trade Services, a warehouse company which is a part of the London Metals Exchange (LME) system. Goldman, for its part, defended the business in a Factsheet released last month. It's been a boon to the bank in a world of low interest rates and low demand for commodities. The problem, says Morgan Stanley, aside from the discomfort of many clients, is that this has started to impact the price of aluminum: A large concentration of metal in a limited number of warehouses created a situation in which buyers of metal were forced to wait for unusually long periods for access. As a result, anyone wanting immediate delivery of material needed to pay a premium based on location availability. These premiums have been elevated to extreme levels, in the case of aluminium, since the beginning of 2012, as competition for immediate delivery of metal became increasingly severe... However, the implicit subsidies of the location premiums have shielded producers from the prevailing price signal to cut output. Consequently, our prediction of lower premiums would pressure marginal producers in those metals most affected by this phenomenon, namely, aluminium but also zinc. So regulators are stepping in, and according to Morgan Stanley, they may actually win this one. On July 1st, the LME  made its first "serious attempt" at fixing this problem by "by linking load-out rates directly with load-in rates in those warehouse locations with queues of greater than 100 days, so called Affected Warehouses." In short, if you bring something into the warehouse, you have to push something out ASAP. This policy would officially be implemented in April of 2014, but the LME is taking measures to prep Affected Warehouses immediately by instituting a "calculation period." Think of it as a load in, load out practice run. According to Morgan Stanley, this whole debacle may not all be said and done for another two years. In the meantime, there will be a few short-term kinks while new regulations set in  warehouses may increase their prices, and the price of aluminum could increase as well. Ultimately, though, the bank thinks this could set things right in terms of the dislocation of aluminum prices as wait times will no longer shield producers from real market demand. Banks that own these warehouses (like Goldman, of course) will see their location premiums fall, making the business less profitable. So there's that.
REUTERS/ Michael HanschkeA new FBI report has discovered the shocking ease at which market-moving economic reports can leak to traders before public release, the Wall Street Journal reports. The government requires "black boxes" for media organizations that release economic indicators such as the monthly jobs report. In theory, the box acts as a trapdoor so data deluges at the same exact time across platforms. You know, fairly. But the FBI found it's possible to circumvent the technology (via elaborate hacks like turning the thing off). This should all sound familiar. Perennially dogged by weird trades milliseconds before data dumps, regulators have long suspected media firms or their rogue employees are in cahoots with traders who can profit from even the smallest of head starts. In fact, the FBI was tipped off when Bloomberg, one such firm, went to set up new devices at the Commerce Department and realized they could get around the black box by using a different electrical current. From the Journal: Bloomberg reported the flaws to the Commerce Department last summer and didn't use the devices in any data releases, Bloomberg told investigators, according to the report. After Bloomberg alerted the department, the FBI conducted a "consensual seizure" of its computers for testing. The inspector general at the Commerce Department found "no evidence of an intentional violation" of the law by Bloomberg or its reporters, according to the report. In October, the FBI informed the Justice Department it found "no evidence of any embargo violation(s)" and the case was closed. In June, Thomson Reuters raised eyebrows when it was revealed their elite clients receive the University of Michigan's consumer confidence data two seconds early, plenty of time to score big profits in algorithmic trading land.

My boss Henry Blodget and I have been debating whether companies have a moral responsibility to pay workers more, since wages are stagnating and corporate profits are at an all time high. This morning, we took that debate to Yahoo! Finance's "The Daily Ticker." Henry says paying higher wages would be an investment in the economy, causing profits to grow even more in the long run. It would also just be a "decent" thing to do. I say wages are driven by market conditions. When unemployment is high and businesses see few reasons to invest and grow, wages will stagnate. The moral responsibility for fixing that situation lies with all of us, not just with shareholdersand the people we should be shaming over wage stagnation are policymakers. Watch the video: 
Raghuram Rajan will head the Reserve Bank of India for a three-year term, replacing incumbent D. Subbarao, who retires next month, the finance ministry said. "Mr Rajan will be the new central bank governor," a senior finance ministry official told AFP. Rajan did his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is acclaimed for having predicted the 2008 global financial crisis -- two years before it struck. He takes the central bank reins as India faces testing economic times -- hit by a capital flight with investors worried about slow growth, a massive deficit, stalled economic reforms and a slew of graft scandals that have paralyzed the political process. Rajan's appointment came on a day of high financial drama in which the Indian currency touched a fresh record low against the dollar of 61.80 rupees. The 50-year-old economist is currently the most senior advisor in the finance ministry and has a reputation for strong pro-market views. A statement issued later by the finance ministry said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had approved the appointment of Rajan to head the nominally independent central bank. Rajan, as chief economic adviser to the government, has worked closely with Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram, known as another strong proponent of economic reform. Rajan was also a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business before taking over as India's chief economic advisor and is author of Fault Lines, an acclaimed account of the subprime financial crisis. He has enjoyed a high profile since returning from the United States last year to take up the finance ministry post and has worked closely with Chidambaram to try to restore India's sagging reputation with investors. Rajan, who favors financial deregulation, is expected to bring new ideas to the RBI which the finance ministry believes to be too conservative, according to the Indian media. Last month, Rajan said "all options were on the table" to stabilize India's currency at the same time as saying defence of the rupee should not suffocate economic growth. The rupee has come under pressure from India's record current account deficit -- the broadest measure of trade, an economy growing at a 10-year low of five percent and fears of a reduction in US stimulus that have spurred investor flows to emerging markets.

The Wall Street firms that do business with SAC Capital are right to be privately worried about possible legal contamination from the criminal indictment against the hedge fund. Publicly, Wall Street is standing behind SAC Capital. It's "business as usual," according to reports. Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs recently praised SAC as "a great counter party" in an interview with my colleague Kate Kelly. But behind the scenes, Wall Street executives are worried, according to people familiar with the matter. All the biggest Wall Street firms have extensive ties to SAC Capital â ties that could put them in legal jeopardy, particularly under much larger exposure spelled out in the Dodd-Frank banking reform regulations.. It would be hard to over-estimate the significance of SAC Capital to Wall Street. The hedge fund employs what has been described as "significant leverage" in its trading strategies, borrowing money so that the firm is able to take trading positions that aggregate to much more than the roughly $15 billion of assets it has under management. The firm lists its regulatory assets as $50 billion in a recent regulatory filing, for example. Much of that leverage comes from loans from Wall Street banks. Even that understates how much business SAC does through the top Wall Street firms. That $50 billion is a snapshot in time, not a cumulative count of all of the assets that SAC acquires and disposes of throughout the year. No one outside of SAC â and very few inside of SAC â knows the total volume of trading SAC is responsible for across all the markets it trades in, but it's a safe bet that the number is in the hundreds of billions. That kind of volume makes handling SAC's trades very big business for its prime brokers. Over the years, SAC Capital has paid billions in fees to its prime brokers, people in the sector estimate. According to a recent regulatory filing, those on the receiving end of SAC's prime brokerage fees include all the big prime brokers â Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. In short, there's SAC money flowing all over Wall Street. At many of these firms, there are people whose entire careers are built around their relationship with the hedge fund. They work for SAC almost as much as they work for their nominal employers â and certainly their paychecks depend on robust SAC trading. "These folks may be eating crumbs that fall from the table of SAC â but those crumbs are made of gold," one person at a prime broker used by SAC said (he does not work directly with SAC). So the news that the Justice Department is not seeking to freeze SAC's assets is welcome on Wall Street. The fees also explain why Goldman's Gary Cohn uses the phrase "great counter-party" to describe a hedge fund under criminal indictment. If the Justice Department's investigation were to somehow put a halt to "business as usual," the big Wall Street firms would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. But the loss of revenue may not be the worst of it. Wall Street may face an even greater â if less probable â danger if SAC were to be convicted of criminal charges. Some prime brokers and their employees could find themselves targeted by regulators for "aiding and abetting" the alleged securities law violations of SAC. Ever since the mid-nineties, the Securities and Exchange Commission has had the ability to bring aiding and abetting claims against those who assist in securities fraud. Bringing a claim under this act, however, was complicated because it required that the SEC prove that the accused "knowingly" provided assistance to the fraud. In practice, this meant that few aiding and abetting cases were actually brought by the SEC. The Dodd-Frank financial reforms loosened this standard considerably, allowing the SEC to bring cases against third parties who "recklessly" provide aid to securities fraudsters. This means the SEC no longer has to prove that a third-party knew about the fraud, only that it failed to take reasonable measures to detect or prevent it. For Wall Street firms that have long-standing relationships with SAC, this could mean trouble. Up until Dodd-Frank, they would have enjoyed a certain level of immunity from being contaminated by allegations of insider trading by even a very large client. Under the current law, however, they could potentially be found liable for not taking steps to detect or prevent insider trading. Both executing trades for SAC and lending money to provide leverage for allegedly illicit trades could land prime brokers in hot water. For most insider trading cases, it would be a stretch to blame the broker for not detecting insider trading. But with SAC, things are different. For starters, the hedge fund has a close relationship with its prime brokers â creating both the incentive to turn a blind eye to illicit trading and the opportunity for brokers to detect it. Regulators could argue that the pattern of trading at SAC should have raised "red flags" to the brokers â much as the Justice Department has argued that SAC turned a blind eye to "red flags" with respect to its traders. "If there was some kind of notice â a 'red flag' â that a broker should have picked up on, the SEC would have an easier time [bringing an aiding and abetting case] under Dodd-Frank," says Gregory J. Wallance, a former assistant U.S. attorney now working in the white collar litigation department of Kaye Scholer. In all likelihood the prime brokers have probably already received subpoenas demanding information about the allegedly illicit trades, according to Wallance. "In the course of an investigation, the grand jury subpoenas go out to so many people. Then they have all this information that they got. It's not that difficult to, say, start going through the secondary actors and lets see if there are suspicious patterns," Wallance says. Several of the prime brokers are already conducting internal investigations, according to people familiar with the matter. "The prime brokers are aware now of the SEC indictment. They're likely thinking: 'We'd better investigate whether we had such red flags.' If they turn anything up, they could end up going to the Department of Justice or the SEC with the information in hopes of receiving leniency," Wallance says. Once factor that may matter in terms of attracting attention of regulators would be whether the execution or leverage for allegedly illicit trades tended to come from a single prime broker. In addition, if a prime broker provided service for a number of illicit trades that created a clear pattern that would have been reasonably detectable, the SEC might be prompted to take action. The worst fact pattern for a prime brokerage would be the existence of an email raising concerns that were then ignored or dismissed by the firm. No such evidence is in the public record at this time. Ironically, the huge volume of trading done by SAC might help the fund's brokers stay out of trouble. Only a small number of trades are alleged to have been illicit, a tiny fraction of the volume SAC conducts through its prime brokers. This could make it very difficult for a counter-party to detect any pattern of unlawful trading. This would be a novel case for the SEC â and one not without perils for the agency. The SEC probably doesn't want to risk an early loss on a relatively untested legal authority. It's also unclear if courts would allow the Dodd-Frank change to be applied retroactively, a necessary concession if SAC's prime brokers were to be held liable for trades made several years ago. The SEC could also decide that it is just unfair to hold prime brokers liable for reckless conduct that occurred before the legal changes. The Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. Spokes folks for Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment.
Image courtesy of Goldman SachsThe technology department at Goldman Sachs is not only one of the biggest divisions at the Wall Street giant, but it's also one of the most crucial.Â  The firm executes millions of trades on exchanges all around the world and none that that would be possible without a technology infrastructure that could scale and support that type of volume. And of course, one way to secure a job in this division is to intern for the summer.Â  We spoke with Hari Moorthy, a managing director and technology fellow at Goldman. Â Moorthy is the global manager of margin risk for prime brokerage, futures, clearance and execution in Goldman's global securities services division.Â  When he's evaluating a candidate for a technology department position, he told us that he looks for three key skills â technology background, analytical skills and communication/leadership. Those, he explained, fundamentally cover a large gamut of skills that they look for in the technology department of Goldman.Â  He added that they also emphasize innovation and using cutting edge technology for those who work in the technology division. Â  MoorthyÂ also told us what an intern can do to impress him and the biggest mistake they can make. We've transcribed our Q&amp;A with Moorthy below. (Note: This has been lightly edited for clarity). JL: Can you talk about your background and how you got to where you are today? HM: I joined Goldman in December 2007. I joined into the margin technology group within prime services technology. Prior to that, I worked at a firm called CheckFree Investment Services, chief architect and of software development, focusing on their strategic software development within that division.Â  JL: Can you describe what the typical day is like for an intern in your division? What sort of responsibilities do they have at Goldman?Â  HM: Sure. Part of our motivation within the intern program is for them to get to know us and for us to get to know them. So in that spirit, we actually give them full responsibility for them to take them through their project which normally takes them about eight weeks. One of the things we do prior is define what kind of project they have to do so that they can actually run through the entire lifecycle of that project. That includes giving them a requirement for what they need to deliver, developing the software, testing it, productionizing it, talking to users, so they get a complete flavor for Â everything that have to do if they were working at Goldman.Â  JL: How do you decide how much responsibility to give an intern?Â  HM: Within the context of the eight weeks that I talked about, we want them to get a flavor for enterprise software development practice. Â It's easier for an intern to say I've developed a particular piece of software, but developing it in the context of a bank and making it production quality is very important. So we do give full responsibility for them to the extent that they can take it and we want them to be successful in that framework.Â  JL: How about preparing for an internship in this division. What sort of skills does somebody need?Â  HM:Â I think broadly speaking, I would actually say that about three major skill sets, if you will. Obviously, technology background. This being a technology division, you would expect interns to have some idea and basic course work in that regard. The second broad category I would mention is analytical skills, right. You know understanding what a particular data set would mean within that context. And then the third broad category I would say is communication and leadershipâThe ability to interact in a fairly big, complex organization. JL: For someone who is interested in interning in the technology department, what classes should they take in school? How do they prepare for an internship? HM:Â As the name implies, as it's all about technology, having basic coursework in programming languages such as Java or C++, having coursework in data structures and data-based technology would be useful and then brushing up on basic capital markets knowledge would also be useful.Â  JL: OK, just going back to the more day-to-day stuff? What's the work day like?Â  HM:Â I think it's no different from employees, we really strive hard for them to be part of our family during their stay and make sure that they get the same level of time from their senior managers and peers to they feel really like part of our family.Â  JL: Â Do you mentor interns in your division?Â  HM:Â Yes. That's one of the major programs that they've instituted in our division. We have a formal mentorship administered and organized by our Human Capital Management department. We also have an informal network of buddies who had been interns at the firm at some point in time spending some time with interns. I can't emphasize how much time our senior management within our division spend to make the intern program successful. To illustrate that point, this year we started a half a day long hosting of interns. And pretty much the top forty of our senior managers, all MDs, have spent time with interns explaining what each our divisions within technology have been doing and the direction they've been heading to. So yes we do take the intern experience and internship very seriously at the senior level of this division.Â  JL: So I want to talk about intern advice now. So in your opinion, what's the biggest mistake an intern can make?Â  HM: I think the biggest mistake is when a person is stuck with a problem or a problem appears to be to complex or too huge, not talking to someone else for advice or seeking help. To me, that probably is the biggest mistake because a person can spend a lot of time trying to understand on their own time. That's something that would be easily available from somebody else's prior experience and knowledge. JL: What's something that impressed you about an intern?Â  HM: I think innovation, right. Looking at a problem in an entirely new way and solving it within the context of enterprise technology I spoke about. You know, technology is evolving at a very high speed, you know, and it's actually very difficult to catch up. Â To the extent that they have understood the problem they're trying to solve and they are able to look at it in a brand new prism, that's very impressive.Â  JL: If I was an intern in the technology division, what would be a good way to stand out? HM:Â I think completing the project at hand in the best possible manner and also going a step ahead and seeing how to best to change or innovate within the context of that project. It's always good to look at the problem in a brand new way... that would be a standout.Â  JL: What advice would you have for an intern who really wants to get a job offer from Goldman?Â  HM: I think doing the best possible job within that project context that the intern is working on and hitting that out of the park is probably the best advice I'd give. After all, it would be at a firm where actions speak louder than words... JL: We have a very competitive job market out there, so what are some of the details which make a difference on aÂ rÃ©sumÃ© or in a job interview? HM: I would use the same classifications I spoke about earlier. Technical skillsâillustrating prior experience or prior coursework any sort of familiarity with the technology background the person has had would be really useful. And then, the second one is difficult to explain in aÂ rÃ©sumÃ©, but very important in an interview is to display analytical skills. Â Obviously, learning a piece of technology is useful only if that is applicable in a real problem in a real scenario. Â And then the third broad category is all about communication and leadership, right. The ability to convert a thought process into an actionable system within the context of our firm requires a lot of leadership and communication.Â  JL: So in an interview, do you test them on analytical skills?Â  HM:Â Even if it's not an explicit question in an interview, I would always advise them to demonstrate that aspect of their ability and skill. So kind of showing what sort of work has interested them in the past and what they have done. It's one of the important skills that would differentiate a great intern from a good intern.Â  JL: Just in case people aren't familiar, can you speak to how crucial the technology department is to Goldman Sachs? HM:Â I think the technology department does two major, among many things in my opinion, two major functions â One it serves as a way to improve efficiency and process. Another one is to act as a control function in our ability to understand and appreciate the entire business model that Goldman has. So it's very crucial and we have senior business leaders confirming that often and often again. We have been doing these Q&amp;A's with Goldman managing directors. Â You can check out our investment management division managing director Q&amp;AÂ here. Up next is the securities division.Â 
screnshotNo worries, Bob! There's room for you!The new owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, has been kind enough to promise to pay the existing salary (or better) of everyone who works there for at least a year. After that, though, all bets are presumably off. And one thing that is instantly clear to anyone who so much as glances at the Washington Post's financial performance is that the company is spending way beyond its means. How much beyond? Well, the Post lost about $15 million in the second quarter. If you annualize that, the company is currently losing about $60 million a year. And the losses are growing. Now, it's possible that Jeff Bezos will decide to keep investing (losing) buckets of money in the Post every year. But, even if he does this, he is likely to re-allocate that investment to promising opportunities, so the money doesn't just get incinerated the way it is today. So it's likely that, at some point, the Post will analyze itself and figure out what investments are promising and what it can really afford. One area that obviously costs a lot at the Post is the newsroom. The Post still has a startling number of journalists on staff -- 640, according to David Remnick at the New Yorker. 640 is considerably fewer journalists than the Post had on staff a couple of decades ago (1,000), so to long-time staffers, the newsroom probably feels emaciated and puny. But compared to most newsrooms these days, 640 is a vast number of journalists. How much do 640 journalists cost per year? Well, given that the Washington Post employs excellent, experienced journalists, they probably cost about $150,000 a year apiece, when including benefits, real-estate, T&amp;Es, and so forth. This suggests that the Washington Post is spending about $96 million a year on its newsroom. Now, here's the great news. The great news is that, even though the overall Washington Post is shrinking and losing money, the digital version of the Post is actually doing quite well. The digital version of the Post generated $30 million of revenue in the second quarter, an amount that increased 15% year over year. Some of that revenue came from Slate, which will now be separated from the Post. But it seems safe to assume that the digital Washington Post itself generates at least $100 million of revenue a year. So, how many journalists can you afford on digital revenue of $100 million a year? (The print Washington Post is shrinking and dying, so we'll just ignore that for now.) Well, assuming you want to make at least a little profit--say 10%-15%--here's what sustainable numbers might look like: REVENUE: $100 millionNEWSROOM COSTS: $35 million (35% of revenue)SALES, TECH, and MANAGEMENT COSTS: $50 million (50% of revenue) OPERATING PROFIT: $15 million (15% of revenue) With that newsroom budget--$35 million--the Washington Post would be able to sustainably afford about 250 journalists. That's a far cry from the 640 it employs today. But let's assume that Jeff Bezos is willing to invest a bit of money in the Post (i.e., not make a profit). And let's assume that Bezos will be smart enough to figure out how to grow the digital revenue every year. Then how many journalists could the Washington Post afford? Here's what the numbers might look like: REVENUE: $150 millionNEWSROOM COSTS: $75 million (50% of revenue)SALES, TECH, and MANAGEMENT COSTS: $75 million (50% of revenue) OPERATING PROFIT: $0 This operating scenario would allow the Post to have a much bigger newsroom budget--say, $75 million a year. (That's a huge newsroom budget, by the way. At Business Insider, we would be over-the-moon to have a budget like that. You could produce an unbelievable amount of super-high-quality digital journalism on that budget). A newsroom budget of $75 million would mean a newsroom of about 500 journalists. 500 journalists is a lot of journalists. It is fewer than 640 journalists, true, but it's not actually that many fewer. So even if Jeff Bezos isn't willing to burn unlimited pots of money at the Washington Post, this suggests that the Post could ultimately sustain a newsroom that is at least close in size to the one it currently has. That's good news for the folks at the Post! SEE ALSO: Why I Think Jeff Bezos Bought The Washington Post
REUTERS/Scott AudetteHog prices have surged this summer thanks to a rare, nasty virus that's swept across livestock country. As The New York Times Steven Yaccino reports, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus has hit more than 16 states and killed hundreds of thousands of piglets (it only affects young swine and thus does not pose a risk to food supplies). It's unusual for the disease to appear in the U.S. It was last seen in China in 2012. Yaccino writes: By the end of July,Â 403 separate casesÂ had been reported to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network of the Department of Agriculture, with most outbreaks occurring in Iowa (149) and Oklahoma (94). About 30 new cases are reported each week. âThereâs not many times that a new virus hits an industry that has no immunity,â saidÂ Robert Morrison, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Minnesota who has been studying the virus. âEvery pig in the United States is susceptible. Itâs like throwing a spark on a bunch of kindling.â As a result, since mid-May, August contract prices have surged by about $10 (or 11%) and now stand at $1.00/lb: CME Group "October and December contracts gaining on mounting speculation that the effects of the supply constriction due to PEDv will largely be seen in hogs marketed during those periods," Societe Generale agricultural commodities analyst Christopher Narayanan told us in an email. Prices have also been pushed higher by lingering gains in beef prices, he said. Morningstar's Ken Perkins agreed prices could stay up for the next several months. "The number of infected animals should decline over time assuming the issue is contained, but it could still take time to make up the shortfall," he told us in an email. Yaccino says scientists are working on a vaccine.Â  However, he notes that all of this has also prompted fears about what other viruses may be entering the country.Â 
Bloomberg TVYou don't hear many bearish arguments for U.S. stocks these days from the likes of Wall Street strategists. As ConvergEx Group chief market strategist Nick Colas puts it, "A bearish take on U.S. stocks is about as fashionable as a beehive hairdo at the moment." In that spirit, Colas presents the "real bearish case  that the current market trend to the upside is at an end and weve seen the highs for 2013." "Heres what that looks like," writes Colas in a note to clients: Myth: U.S. stocks still seem cheap-ish based on 2013 earnings expectations of $110/share for the S&amp;P 500.  That works out to a 15.5x multiple on current earnings, and stock have room to go much higher.  How high?  Maybe 18 times that $110, or 2000 on the S&amp;P 500. Reality: Yes, current estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings sit at $110/share.  Want to know where they were in January 2013?  Try $112/share.  How about a year ago, for 2013? Try $115.  And in March 2012?  Yeah, higher  over $118.  The bottom line is that the S&amp;P 500 isnt going to earn $110/share.  Maybe it will be $108.  Or maybe $107  So what do you want to pay for every-diminishing earnings expectations?  Hint: It isnt 18x earnings.  It might not be 16x, or where we are today. Myth: U.S. stocks will grow into their earnings expectations as the U.S. economies recover.  Reality: OK, this one might be true.  The problem with the assumption is that U.S. equities have the reputation for being the only game in town at the moment.  European economies excluding Germany are still deeply troubled.  Emerging markets look risky and in some cases politically unstable.  Japans monetary policy experiment isnt yet showing strong results.  So what happens when the U.S. economy does accelerate?  This will potentially drag the rest of the world with it, making those capital markets look more attractive.  So much for the only game in town.  Consider the following: of the $35 billion in money flows into U.S. stock ETFs thus far in the third quarter of 2013, $15 billion has landed in one product: the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF.  The SPY is now the largest ETF in the U.S. capital markets at $157 billion and represents one out of every 10 dollars invested in U.S. listed ETFs.  This isnt an endorsement or a refutation of the product.  The point is that the appetite for U.S. stocks appears to be heavily concentrated in the most liquid index even when other equally efficient options actually have better returns (i.e. Russell 2000). Myth: Theres still plenty of worry warts out there who havent bought U.S. stocks and will need to fill up the tank as equities continue to grind higher.  Reality: Real money doesnt always trade volatility, but when they do they prefer the VIX.  OK, needless pop reference, I know.  But consider that the CBOE VIX Index closed today at 11.8.  I know that 15 is the new 20 for the VIX, meaning that its long run average of 20 is really more like a 15 reading today.  And thats fair enough with easy monetary policy and a reassuring central bank helping the case.  But an 11-handle is just 3 points away from all-time lows for this measure of market expectations as they relate to near term volatility.  There are some seasonal factors at play here  August tends to be lower volume and volatility for U.S. stocks  to be sure. Consider, however, that we also had a wide-ranging terror warning from the U.S. Government over the weekend in anticipation of threats related to this week.  Where would the VIX have closed without that caveat?  A 10-handle?  Nine something? "The upshot of these observations on the VIX and other factors is that you might still be able to make a decent return between now and the end of the quarter in U.S. stocks, but you need to believe that there are no speed bumps on the way," says Colas. "Stocks are the only game in town for now.  So as long as you want to go along with that rosy assessment, you should be all good."
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVEvery year, Cumberland Advisors' David Kotok invites economists, central bankers, and portfolio managers to spend five days fishing at Leen's Lodge in eastern Maine.  Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg attended the camp for the second time this year. In a new note he writes that nobody there was optimistic on economic growth in the U.S. or abroad.  "I was actually perceived as the resident bull (difficult as that one may be to believe). But there were some prominent economists who I have always felt saw things as half-cup-full are quite pessimistic on growth  calling for either zero for 2014 or quite possible an ECRI-style outright relapse.  "There was concern over the lack of any major catalyst and plenty of worry that the sequestering is only starting to bite now, just as the lags are kicking in from the early-2013 tax hikes. And there was no worry at all over inflation with the widespread consensus view that there is far too much slack in the economy." He said there were very few people there that were bullish on stocks, and there were no strong opinions on Treasuries. Last month we pointed out that Rosenberg was starting to sound extremely bullish. He responded to that piece, saying it is a mistake to label him a straight-up bull and that he has become "incrementally more positive on the outlook for the U.S. economy, there is still no shortage of financial risks that have to be addressed at this point."
Since the opening bell, U.S. stocks have taken a turn downward, and are now trading near their lows of the day. Right now, the S&amp;P 500 is trading at 1695, down 0.7% from yesterday's close. Treasuries, on the other hand, aren't moving much. Right now, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 2 basis points higher from yesterday's close at 2.65%. The economic data calendar is thin this week. The only notable release in the United States today was June trade balance data, which saw the U.S. trade deficit shrink to $34.2 billion from $45.0 billion in May. Market economists predicted a much smaller reduction to $43.5 billion. In the wake of the release, economists are revising up tracking estimates for second-quarter GDP figures. Gold is down 1.5%, trading around $1283 an ounce, while WTI crude oil is down 1.0%, trading right around $105.50 a barrel. Thinkorswim
REUTERS/Sebastien NogierByron Wien, Vice Chairman of Blackstone Advisory Services, attends the GAIM International (Global Alternative Investment Management) hedge fund conference in Monaco, June 15, 2010.The title of Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien's latest monthly investment commentary says it all: "Worried About the Second Half." Wall Street's consensus view is that the American economy, which has recorded lackluster growth for much of the past five years since the 2008 recession, will finally take off in the second half, giving stocks the impetus for a renewed move higher. Wien is not so sure. The veteran investment strategist has written extensively about his view that profit margins are peaking. In his commentary, Wien revisits this theme (emphasis added):Â  Although there is a palpable degree of optimism about corporate performance in the second half of this year, I wonder if it is justified.Â  Companies have generally beaten analystsâ estimates more than two-thirds of the time so far this year, but I think that is mostly because management guided estimates lower so the results would compare favorably.Â  That was certainly the case for Alcoa and Coca-Cola.Â  United Parcel Service did not prepare the market for disappointment and the stock declined sharply.Â  In the technology sector Microsoft, Intel and Google missed estimates.Â  Second-quarter earnings are only expected to be up 2% over 2012 levels and full-year estimates are only projected to grow 4%â6% over last year, with much of that improvement coming from stronger performance in the second half. It is unlikely that we are going to see better earnings if sales don't improve. Second-quarter sales are only expected to rise 1.25% over last year and full-year estimates are for a 2.75% increase.Â  If there is some pressure on margins from modestly higher labor costs, depreciation and energy prices, that meager level of revenue improvement may not be enough to keep margins from eroding.Â  It has been my view that profit margins are peaking and we should see if that observation is correct in the second half of 2013. ... I still think the economy will grow at 2% this year, but I worry that final sales will not be enough to offset some margin deterioration.Â  As a result I fear that earnings will be below estimates.Â  I have been worried about economic growth and earnings all year and the Standard &amp; Poorâs 500 has kept working its way higher.Â  The liquidity being provided by the Fed is responsible for that.Â  Valuations are still reasonable and if the easy money policy continues, I recognize that stocks can move up more from here.Â  I think earnings will be below estimates, but investors may not care as long as the Fedâs bond buying program continues.Â  Right now the S&amp;P 500 is trading somewhat above 15 times consensus earnings and slightly more than 16 times the earnings level that reflects a reasonable degree of disappointment.Â  This is not an extreme level of overvaluation, even considering the recent rise in interest rates.Â  Investor sentiment is in optimistic territory, near the level that has signaled a likely decline in the past.Â  Companies have considerable cash on their balance sheets, some of which will be used to buy back stock.Â  That could increase earnings per share, offsetting earnings shortfalls. "While a higher high may be ahead, at some point the Fed will slow its accommodation and investors will recognize the implications of slow economic growth and very modest earnings improvement," Wien concludes. "That is why I believe a degree of caution is warranted."
There are reasons to suggest that YuMe may also disappoint. First, the basics: Yume is pricing its stock at $12-$14, and hopes to raise ~$65 million from the sale. Observers will be cheered by YuMe's financial statements: The company has a bouyant income statement, with robust revenue growth. It has dipped in and out of profitability, indicating that it is plowing its revenues back into the company to make it grow. Its balance sheet shows $26 million in cash. Here's a snapshot: SEC So what's the problem? Look at the expected dilution from existing shareholders: YuMe Eighty-four percent of the company is owned by insiders who got their stock at $3 and change. If the stock stays anywhere near $13, they will all want to sell as soon their lockup schedules allow. That's likely to depress the price once the stock floats. We're not IPO experts, of course.

Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are leading the deal.

Flickr/SCholewiakJanet Yellen, the Fed's vice chair and possible successor to Ben Bernanke, loves the JOLTS reportÂ â the BLS' batch of labor market stats due out later today. Historically, the "Job Openings and Labor Market Survey" has not been as market moving as, say, the BLS' employment situation report. But if Yellen âÂ who has cited JOLTS as a source of economic intelÂ â ascends to the Fed throne, market watchers will keep a keen eye on the report. (If selected, surely Larry Summers will also care about JOLTS.) So here's where we're at ahead of this morning's report. Job openings are on the rise. Despite July's tepid gains, companies are slowly putting more jobs on the market. FRED But hires have more or less flatlined.Â Firms haven't been able to fill all of those new positions. FRED Layoffs plunged recently, but could be moving north. Some new openings, stagnant hires, but low firings? What's going on? It could be "labor hoarding" âÂ firms basically hanging on to the employees that made it through the rough patch. And this is actually a bigger problem than you might think. During the crisis, businesses cut labor costs as much as possible, but at a certain point they couldn't cut anymore. Firms "hoarded," maximizing the productivity of the labor that remained. It seems as though we could still be in that cycle, with meaningful hires yet to break through. FRED Quits are stagnant but have been heading up.Â Quitting your job is a sign of market confidence, so we'll be on the lookout for this figure. FRED
Home prices (including distressed sales) climbed 11.9% year-over-year in June, according to CoreLogic's latest home price report. This is the sixteenth straight monthly rise in home prices. Prices were up 1.9% month-over-month. Ex-distressed sales (short sales and REO transactions), home prices were up 11% on the year, and 1.8% MoM. Meanwhile, in the first half of the year, home prices were up 10%. "This trend in home price gains is moving at the fastest pace since 1977," said CoreLogic's chief economist, Mark Fleming in a press release. Here are some details from the report: Here's a look at the trajectory of home prices from 2002 on: CoreLogic
REUTERS/Jim YoungU.S. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke listens to questions as he testifies before a House Budget Committee hearing on "The Near-Term Outlook for the U.S. Economy" on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 17, 2008.The consensus view on Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will begin to scale back its open-ended quantitative easing program at its September 18-19 FOMC meeting on monetary policy. Under the program, the Fed buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities every month. Primary dealers expect the Fed to announce a reduction in the pace of purchases to $65 billion a month in September. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius is one of those who expects tapering to begin at the conclusion of the September meeting. This prospect has caused a sharp rise in volatility in the U.S. Treasury market over the past three months as investors price in the tapering possibility, but Hatzius argues the Fed will take steps to offset the negative effects of tapering on markets by tweaking its other main policy instrument: guidance on the future path of the fed funds rate, which is currently pinned near zero. The Fed has said that before it will consider raising the fed funds rate, the unemployment rate must fall below 6.5% and inflation must reach 2.5%. Both thresholds are a ways off, but Hatzius says the Fed may tweak them slightly at one of the next two meetings to lend credence to the message that low rates is the status quo for a while yet, in the process hopefully curbing any tapering-induced market volatility. In a note, Hatzius writes: We still expect Fed officials to taper QE at the September 17-18 FOMC meeting, but to offset the impact on financial conditions by reinforcing the forward guidance for the funds rate. There are two broadÂ possibilities for how this might happen. First, they could simply lower the 6.5% unemployment threshold.Â Second, they could make the unemployment threshold depend on inflation and/or labor force participation; thus, inflation below 2% or a further decline in participation would imply a threshold of less than 6.5%. We interpret the fact that the FOMC this week âreaffirmed its viewâ that policy would need toÂ stay highly accommodative even after the end of QE3 as a hint that the guidance will indeed be strengthened further. The FOMC statement did not signal explicitly that this shift in the âmix of instrumentsâ will occur in September, and a later move is possible. But Chairman Bernankeâs various appearances over the past few weeks have prepared the ground for such a shift, and the market seems to have digested it. The Fed leadership transition also argues for September rather than December, as it creates an incentive to make the December meetingâwhich is likely to be close to the confirmation hearings for the new Fed chairâless rather than more eventful. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, after which the "Evans Rule" is named, speaks with reporters in Chicago at 1 PM ET. In a week light on economic data releases, those market participants not on vacation this week will likely be listening closely for any additional clues surrounding the tapering timeline.

Investing.com/Walter Kurtz/Sober LookThe Australian dollar remains under pressure, approaching the lows not seen in nearly three years. The key fundamental reason of course remains China's ongoing economic slowdown. Other fundamentals include: 1. Recent increases in US interest rates (and the risk of rates going even higher).2. Weak global commodity prices (see discussion).3. Weak Brazilian real (see discussion), as Brazil remains one of Australia's key competitors for natural resources exports.4. Australia's producer prices remain subdued, giving the RBA plenty of room to lower rates to historically low levels (see discussion from October of 2012).Investing.com/Walter Kurtz/Sober Look 5. As a result, Australia's short-term rates have declined sharply. Investing.com/Walter Kurtz/Sober Look 6. Australian government budget deficit for 2013/14 is now forecast to be AUD 30bn rather than the AUD 18bn predicted earlier. But fundamentals aside, the short AUD position is becoming a crowded trade, as everyone jumps on the "short Australia as a proxy to China" bandwagon. The Goldman positioning index (based on the CFTC futures data) shows a record buildup in net short speculative positions. Goldman Sachs/Walter Kurtz/Sober Look This tells us that this trade, while correct fundamentally, is vulnerable to sharp upside corrections. The unwind of the short AUD positions could get ugly.
REUTERS/Rafael MarchanteContainer port in Lisbon, PortugalThe June trade numbers are out, and it looks like economists were way off with their expectations. The trade deficit shrank to $34.2 billion from $44.1 billion in May. This is the smallest deficit since October 2009 reports Bloomberg. Economists were looking for a deficit of $43.5 billion. Exports climbed 2.2% to a record $191.2 billion driven by capital goods. Imports declined by 2.5% to $225.4 billion on lower oil imports. Bloomberg notes that the petroleum deficit is at its lowest level since November 2010.Â  During the month, the U.S. imported 234.3 million barrels of oil.
Howard Marks, the brilliant money manager at Oaktree Capital, has just published a must-read memo titled "The Role of Confidence." In the markets and the economy, confidence is often a good thing because it drives stock prices higher and it encourages consumers to spend. "Taken together, the ingredients I see in confidence  belief, optimism and certainty  combine to create a feeling of well-being," wrote Marks. "Confident investors are sure big returns lie ahead." But at extremes, confidence can be a very reliable contrarian indicator of good and bad things to come. For example, lack of confidence creates a great opportunity to buy stocks.  Here's Marks: The essential raw material for a bull market is cheapness, and that cheapness exists in stage one precisely because there are so few believers and so little confidence that favorable developments and good times lie ahead. Thus stage one provides the launching pad for a bull market. Equally, in the third stage the bull market is primed to end  with the bubble popping and a down-cycle setting in  for the simple reason that there are too many believers (and too few skeptics). In short, theres too much confidence and too little cheapness. Its this imbalance that creates market tops. The extremeness of the bull-market upswing  just like the downswing of its bear-market counterpart  gives investors what should be an important signal. "I often say the riskiest thing in the world is widespread belief that theres no risk," wrote Marks. "And certainly that was the prevailing condition in the pre-crisis years of 2005-07, as well as during the tech bubble of the late 1990s. In both instances the era of well-being was followed by a significant economic slowdown and market decline." "A feel-good environment characterized by strong confidence creates pleasant current conditions but encourages dangerous behavior and an ascent (in the economy and the markets) from which a correction becomes inevitable," he continued. "In that way, the less confident attitudes of 2013 create a lackluster, less enjoyable environment, but also a preferable and more prudent base for the future." Marks discussed broadly what has concerned him in the past, what concerns him today, and what concerns him in the long-run. "While conditions, confidence and asset prices all seem moderate today, meaning theres nothing brilliant to say about the short-term outlook, the long term remains worrisome," warned Marks. "Because the U.S. is still able to attract capital from abroad and print money, our financial problems arent pressing at the moment. But the combination of intractable deficit spending, unsustainable entitlement promises and a total dearth of responsible action in Washington certainly raises alarms regarding the future." That's the short of it.  But if you have a few minutes, Marks' letter is definitely worth a read.
Great piece here by the NY Fed putting the history of T-Bond sell-offs in perspective.  They compare the current environment to 1994 and 2003 when t-bonds lost over 10%.  I wont spoil the good presentation they have: The chart below plots the selloffs, showing that the recent one is comparable in magnitude, albeit somewhat smaller, to those seen in 1994 and 2003. In particular, the recent selloff reached a trough on July 5 with a cumulative return of -11.3 percent, versus -13.8 percent in August 2003 and -17.5 percent in November 1994. None of these episodes compares with the steep losses seen in the two Volcker era selloffs of 1979-80 and 1980-82.  Pragmatic Capitalism Pace of Selloff Comparable to 1994 and 2003 . . .  The chart below plots the cumulative returns of three selloffs over time, relative to the start of each selloff, showing that the pace of the recent selloff is comparable to that observed in 1994 and 2003. Returns are quite similar over most of the first month in all three episodes. At the end of the first month through the second month, negative returns continue in the recent selloff and in 2003, but remain flat for some time in 1994.

REUTERS/Toby MelvilleToday's new money millionaire is no stodgy railroad tycoon. Bolstered by continued success in tech, the number of millionaires in North America jumped 11% to 3.73 million, making it the region with the fastest growth, according to Bloomberg Markets Magazine. The question is, then, where is all that money kept? Bloomberg Markets ranked the top firms that manage money for the hyper wealthy. Many of the top multi-family offices are associated with banks (and often try to appear smaller for the sake of mystique). Some firms are independently operated. Right now there is plenty of new client potential all over the globe as assets held by the rich grew to $46.2 trillion last year thanks to success among the $30 million-plus crowd. Firms are looking for new money from Latin American clients in particular.  HSBC came in atop the list, with 340 families and $137.3 billion in assets. Northern Trust (3,457 families, $112 billion) and Bessemer Trust (2,200 families, $77.9 billion) took home the silver and bronze, respectively. 
Reuters / Rick WilkingBezos and Graham on July 10 in Sun Valley.(Reuters) - Donald Graham, the chairman and CEO of The Washington Post Co, started talking to Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos less than a month before cinching a $250 million deal to sell the flagship newspaper to the tech entrepreneur. "I asked him why he wanted to do it and his reasons are the best ones: he believes in what newspapers do and what the Post does and that it's important to the country," Graham said in a phone interview on Monday. Graham said that he and his niece Katharine Weymouth, the Post's publisher, made the decision to put the newspaper up for sale earlier this year after looking at its financial forecasts. "For the first time in either of our lives we said to each other: is ownership by the Washington Post Co the best thing for the newspaper? We could keep it alive, that wasn't the issue. The issue was could we make it strong," Graham said. The company announced the deal earlier on Monday, a move that would end the Graham family's 80-year ownership of one of the country's most influential publications. Washington Post Co retained Allen &amp; Co to start gauging interest from potential buyers early this year. "We had conversations with no more than a dozen other parties," Graham said, declining to name anyone other Bezos. "To my surprise, when (Allen &amp; Co) said they would call him. I said that would be great but I didn't think he would be interested," he added. After a few months of silence, Bezos and Graham decided to meet during Allen &amp; Co's annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in early July. They had two meetings, Graham said. "I named a price and Jeff agreed to pay it," he said. (Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Bernard Orr)
REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniFederal Reserve Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen watches before being introduced on stage at the Town Hall Los Angeles forum in Los Angeles March 23, 2010.A weaker-than-expected July jobs report in the U.S. on Friday did a little to temper consensus expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin to taper back the pace of monthly bond purchases it makes as soon as the September FOMC meeting. Strength in prior job reports this year has been the cause for big sell-offs in the bond market as traders price in increased chances of tapering, but Friday, the market had the opposite reaction, piling into bonds and sending yields lower. Now, Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist and former FOMC secretary Vincent Reinhart says the Fed's decision over whether or not to begin tapering in September comes down to one more datapoint: the August jobs report, due out in a month. "The net consequence of the neither hot-nor-cold report is that the Fed really will be data dependent in its decision on tapering at its September meeting," writes Reinhart in a note. "If the August jobs report is weaker than the print on Friday, then it would be difficult to justify dialing back policy accommodation. A report around these July payroll gains or stronger, the Fed can assert that there has been enough sustained improvement to justify scaling back the pace of its purchases." Reinhart believes the August report will be better than the July report, which means according to his assertion, the FOMC will be set to announce a tapering of quantitative easing at the September meeting.
REUTERS/Remo Casilli Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.Italy just released second quarter GDP figures, which showed that the country continued to contract last quarter. GDP fell 0.2% in the second quarter after contracting 0.6% in Q1, beating consensus estimates for a 0.4% decline. Year over year, GDP fell 2.0%, better than expectations for a 2.2% decline. However, at eight quarters running, Italy's recession is now the longest on record. "Italy's economy is no longer in freefall, but it continues to contract, dragged down by a collapse in domestic demand, a severe credit crunch and the adverse effects of a tax-driven fiscal consolidation programme," says Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. "The best that can be said about Italy's moribund economy is that it is stabilising and showing signs of a recovery of sorts. A quarterly contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter of this year is significantly better than a decline of 0.9% in the last quarter of 2012."
Flickr/michaloIt's a quiet morning in the markets as we enter the dog days of summer. Right now, U.S. stock and bond futures are flat. French, Spanish, and Italian stocks are up marginally, while London and Germany are down marginally. In Asia, the Nikkei closed Tuesday up 1 percent and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5%, but the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.3%. "After a busy period for macro, it seems weâve now reached a post-nonfarm payrolls and summer-induced lull, if volumes across a number of markets are anything to go by," writes Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a note. "Indeed, according to Bloomberg data, yesterdayâs S&amp;P 500 volumes were the lowest for a Monday since 12th November 2012 excluding the Monday just before Christmas Day. The absence of any major headlines in the last 48 hours and the slow run-off of the U.S./European reporting calendar have also added to the temporary pause weâre experiencing." Major economic data releases this morning include Italian Q2 GDP figures, due out at 5 AM ET, and German factory orders data for June, due out at 6 AM. Italian GDP is expected to have fallen 2.2% year over year in the second quarter. German factory orders, meanwhile, are expected to have risen 1.0% in June from the previous month. Then, at 8:30, we get June data on the U.S. trade balance. Economists predict the deficit narrowed to $43.5 billion in June from $45.0 billion in May. "Range-bound Treasuries and rallying risk assets may be the order of the day," says SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale global strategist Kit Juckes. "On balance, I could see why that mix would be better for Euro (and even more so GBP) than for the USD or JPY, though none are actually moving."
