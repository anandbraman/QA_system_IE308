ReutersNEW YORK (Reuters) - American Eagle silver coin sales in January surged to an all-time monthly high as the U.S. Mint resumed sales after huge demand triggered a brief suspension, and gold coins also posted their best performance since July 2010. As of January 29, silver Eagle sales for the month were 7.1 million ounces, data from the U.S. Mint's website showed, surpassing its previous record of 6.1 million ounces set in January 2012. (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/myb35t) "Not only do we have clients calling in, they are buying in huge quantities," said David Beahm, vice president of Blanchard &amp; Co, a New Orleans-based retail coin dealer. "They are buying the entire 500-ounce boxes that are sealed by the U.S. Mint, that's what people want right now," said Beahm, referring to the standard sealed silver Eagle "monster" box containing 500 one-ounce coins the Mint sells only to its handful of authorized wholesalers. Earlier this week, the Mint resumed supplying silver Eagles after it halted sales on January 17 as soaring demand depleted its stock. However, silver coin sales to dealers are still through the allocation process, or rationing, a U.S. Mint spokesman said on Tuesday. With two more days remaining in January, gold coin sales were 140,000 ounces, compared with 127,000 ounces for all of January 2012. Sales appear set for the highest monthly tally since July 2010. U.S. gold and silver coin sales have been exceptionally strong in January, building on a late 2012 rally as collectors scramble to snap up newly minted 2013 coins and investors seek refuge from U.S. economic uncertainty. Some coin dealers, however, warn of a post-January drop in sales similar to last year's pattern, as early interest tends to wane once the first mintage is over.

YouTubeValue investors buy stocks that they consider to be trading at less than intrinsic value.¬† Warren Buffett is a well-known value investor. However, it can be very unpleasant being a value investor. Value stocks don't always recover their perceived value in a timely manner.¬† In fact, more often than not, prices will sink further. And the investor inevitably questions whether he made a mistake.¬† After all, it's always possible that the stock will never recover its value. In a recent blog post, legendary NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran said that he believes there is now a 90 percent chance Apple is undervalued.¬† He described himself as a "value optimist" on the stock. But he doesn't expect the stock to just go straight up from here. For those courageous value investors who are have have decided to "take the leap" on Apple, Damodaran offers five cautionary notes.¬† These notes apply for all value investors.
flickrOver the past few weeks, we've been writing about the GOP's shift away from hardcore budget-slashing to a broader agenda of economic growth and job creation.¬† In the wake of last month's fiscal cliff embarrassments, a growing number of conservative leaders have been pushing for Republicans to lay off the debt issue and start talking about something else ... something more positive. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has reportedly led the charge among House Republicans, urging his caucus to start figuring out "how to make life work better," a new motto that is also the title of a speech Cantor will give at the American Enterprise Institute on this topic next week. At the Republican National Convention, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal told the GOP to "stop being the stupid party," and start talking about growth, rather than austerity.¬† Despite the lofty rhetoric, however, Republicans have offered few specifics about what their new economic agenda would look like. What we want to know now is: What exactly are these "pro-growth" policies that Republicans claim to want to pursue? We posed this question to Brad Dayspring, Republican communications strategist who has been actively pushing a new "pro-growth" message.¬† "There are lots of different policies that you can look at," said Dayspring, a former aide to Cantor who was recently named communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.¬†Specifically, Dayspring said, Republicans could look at lowering taxes and rolling back regulations as possible policies that would promote economic growth. "Underneath those policies is the desire to get investors investing again, to get consumers consuming again, and to get employers hiring again," he said.¬† Dayspring's rather limited answers underscore the fundamental struggle that the GOP faces in coming up with a "positive" economic agenda: Conservative ideology has centered around limited government principles, which almost always see federal power as the problem, rather than a solution. As a result, it is difficult for Republicans to come up with any economic solutions that don't revolve around Federal cuts.  In his¬†New York Times¬†column today,¬†David Brooks highlights this problem and calls for a split in the GOP, imagining a new wing of the party that doesn't ascribe to its anti-government tenets.¬† Brooks writes:¬† Can current Republicans change their underlying mentality to adapt to these realities? Intellectual history says no. People almost never change their underlying narratives or unconscious frameworks. Moreover, in the South and rural West, where most Republicans are from, the Encroachment Story has deep historic and psychological roots. Anti-Washington, anti-urban sentiment has characterized those cultures for decades. It‚Äôs probably futile to try to change current Republicans. It‚Äôs smarter to build a new wing of the Republican Party, one that can compete in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic states, in the upper Midwest and along the West Coast. It‚Äôs smarter to build a new division that is different the way the Westin is different than the Sheraton. The second G.O.P. would tackle both problems at once. It would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama‚Äôs second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don‚Äôt share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P. Brooks' third-party Republicans are clearly a fantasy; moreover, he probably overestimates the divisions in the GOP. As Dayspring illustrates, the GOP's recent shift away from spending cuts toward a "smarter," "pro-growth" message is still rhetorical, rather than substantive. Republicans fundamentally believe that the amount of government spending is a major long-term problem.¬† "I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time,"¬†Dayspring told Business Insider.¬†"Cutting budgets is a necessity of our environment, but it's not exactly an aspirational message. I think most Republicans understand that, I think most House Republicans understand it. They need to be able to balance the need to cut budgets with a positive vision for economic growth."¬† "The more often we can do that, the more often we will be equipped to sell our economic message," he added.¬†
Courtesy of MSNBCSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today that the Senate will vote sometime this week on the†House-passed bill to suspend the debt ceiling, allowing the Treasury to borrow whatever it needs to fund the government through May 18.† The bill, championed by Republican House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Chair Paul Ryan, is an unusual one with a format that is unprecedented in recent debt ceiling history. But analysts think that in some ways, the setup could actually be beneficial for future fiscal talks because it takes out much of the uncertainty leading up to the next potential fight. The big difference between this debt-ceiling bill is that it is not technically a clean hike in the nation's debt limit. It's a suspension of the debt ceiling for a certain time period. On May 19, the debt limit will be raised by an amount "necessary to fund commitment incurred by the Federal Government that required payment." The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that number will be around $450 billion.† Though the term "necessary to fund commitment" seems unspecific, the debt ceiling bill actually takes a lot of uncertainty out of the next debate,†Loren Adler, a senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Business Insider.† Here's how Adler explained it would take away from the uncertainty: Adler said the bottom line is this: If the bill is signed into law this week, , as expected,†it could make the next round of debt-ceiling talks much easier.† "The sooner we can pass this, the less headache it's going to cause next time around," Adler said.†

A big economic announcement this week will be tomorrow's Advance Estimate for Q4 GDP from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The final number for Q3 GDP was 3.1%. The general consensus is that Q4 will show a significant decline in this broad measure of the economy. Investing.com weighs in at 1.8%. According to Briefing.com, the consensus for Q4 is 1.0%. However, Briefing.com's own estimate, I should point out, is considerably lower at 0.1%. The substantial spread between the Briefing.com consensus and its own estimate prompts a question. What is the distribution of opinions among a broad range economists on this benchmark metric? Is the range wide or narrow? Let's review the data in the Wall Street Journal's January survey of economists, conducted January 4-8, which is available in Excel format here. Fifty of the 52 economists solicited in the survey responded. The chart below arranges their Q4 GDP forecasts horizontally from low-to-high to give us a visualization of the distribution of responses and any outliers. As the chart suggests, the majority of professionals fall into a fairly narrow range around the 1.5% Median (middle), which is also the Mode (most frequent number). The Mean (average) was slightly higher at 1.56% (1.6% at one decimal place). A conspicuous feature of this visualization is the half-dozen outliers in the 2.4% to 2.7% range. Looking Ahead to Q1 What do the economists see for Q1 of 2013? Not surprisingly, the forecast spread widens as economists look further into the future, ranging from 0.5% to 3.1%. The Mode, at 1.5%, is the same as for Q4 2012; the Median is fractionally higher at 1.6%. The Mean is a bit higher at 1.7% resulting from the increasing optimism at the high end. The numbers noticeably improve for Q2 2013, with the Median and Mode both rising to 2.0%, and the Mean rises to 2.2%. Also, we have a pair of optimists who put the Q2 number at 3.6%, which is above the historic average of 3.2% since the inception of quarterly GDP in 1948. Incidentally, the 10-year moving average is only 1.7%. I'll close with the WSJ economists' forecast for the annual 2013 GDP. Here we see the Median rise to 2.2% and the Mean to 2.2%. The Mode (most frequent forecast) curiously slips a bit to 1.9%. I'm posting this at Tuesday midday. On Wednesday morning we'll be able to determine how close the WSJ consensus on Q4 GDP (first chart above) is to the BEA's Advance Estimate.

McClendon to Retire from the Company on April 1, 2013 Board Announces that its Extensive Review of Alleged Conflicts of Interest and Other Matters Involving McClendon Has to Date Found No Improper Conduct, Final Report to be Completed in Mid-February OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 29, 2013-- Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) today announced that its Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, Aubrey K. McClendon, has agreed to retire from the company on April 1, 2013 and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer until his successor is appointed. Mr. McClendon, 53, has served as Chesapeake‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer since the inception of the company in 1989 and served as Chairman of the Board from its founding until 2012. Archie W. Dunham, Chairman of the Board, stated: ‚ÄúOver the past 24 years, Aubrey McClendon has created one of the most valuable and innovative companies in the energy industry. Under Aubrey‚Äôs strong leadership, Chesapeake has built an unmatched portfolio of natural gas and oil assets in creating one of the world‚Äôs leading energy companies. He has been a pioneer in the development of unconventional resources, and he has also been a leader in the effort to make the United States energy independent. However, as the company moves towards more fully developing the value of its outstanding assets, Chesapeake is at an important transition in its history and Aubrey and the Board of Directors have agreed that the time has come for the company to select a new leader. The Board will be working collaboratively with Aubrey to make a smooth transition to Chesapeake‚Äôs next Chief Executive Officer.‚Äù Mr. Dunham continued: ‚ÄúGoing forward, the company will strive to continue as a low cost producer of oil and gas while further enhancing and strengthening its balance sheet. Capital allocation and operating decisions will be made with the goal of prudently growing the company‚Äôs intrinsic value per share for the long-term benefit of its shareholders. By forging ahead with a new Chief Executive Officer, the company‚Äôs strong management team and talented employees will continue to develop the industry‚Äôs best assets to create substantial value for shareholders and themselves in the years ahead.‚Äù Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, said: ‚ÄúOver the past 24 years, I have had the privilege of developing Chesapeake into one of the world‚Äôs premier energy companies. It has been an honor to work with my outstanding management team and the company‚Äôs 12,000 very talented and dedicated employees. I am extremely proud of what we have built over the last quarter of a century, and I am confident that Chesapeake is in a great position to continue to grow and achieve great success in the future as it realizes the full value of its outstanding assets. While I have certain philosophical differences with the new Board, I look forward to working collaboratively with the company and the Board to provide a smooth transition to new leadership for the company.‚Äù The Board expects to release the results of its previously announced review of the financing arrangements, and other matters, between Mr. McClendon (and the entities through which he participates in the Founder Well Participation Program) and any third party that has had or may have a relationship with the company in any capacity, in its earnings announcement scheduled for release before market open on February 21, 2013.

The Board has retained Heidrick &amp; Struggles to assist the Board in its search of Mr. McClendon‚Äôs successor. The Board also intends to consult with Mr. McClendon in connection with this search. The search process will include a full review of internal and external candidates. During this interim period, Mr. McClendon will work closely with Steven C. Dixon, Chief Operating Officer, and Domenic J. Dell‚ÄôOsso, Jr., Chief Financial Officer, to transition certain day-to-day management responsibilities in advance of the completion of the search process for the new Chief Executive Officer.

Mr. McClendon will resign from the Board of Directors at the time his successor is appointed and will receive his full compensation and other benefits to which he is entitled in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement.

WealthTrack via YouTubeGluskin Sheff economist David Rosenberg is known for his bearish views, and he's not afraid of an epic sell-off in the bond market anytime soon, even though the idea is beginning to play pretty significantly into the evolving market discourse right now. Needless to say, Rosenberg is not convinced by the "Great Rotation" story (the idea that investors will stage a big rotation out of bond funds and into equity funds as the economy picks up and the Federal Reserve begins to normalize monetary policy). In a note to clients today, Rosenberg weighs in on the "Great Rotation" directly. He says that the "impact of fund flows are so overblown," and essentially agrees with John Hussman's argument that those touting a "Great Rotation" don't really understand the mechanics of the market. Moreover, Rosenberg says investors should be careful what they wish forñthe rotation could go in the other direction. Here is his take (emphasis added): However, our own empirical research points to little more than a marginal statistically significant relationship between the general public's appetite for risk and the eventual move in the equity market (in some cycles, the correlation is inverse so for the 'rotation-asistas' among us ñ this could be a classic case of beware what you wish for). After all, did the lack of retail investor participation this cycle prevent the S&amp;P 500 from rebounding 120% from its depressed lows (as it did three times in the 1930s)? Again, citing our empirical research, nothing has been as correlated with the equity market over the past four years as the Fed's balance sheet. Lo' and behold, is it really coincidence that the Russell 2000, the mid-cap stocks, the unweighted S&amp;P 500 and Dow Transports all hit new all-time highs the same week the assets under management at the Federal Reserve Hedge Fund reached $3 trillion for the first time (I mean, that even puts PIMCO and BlackRock to shame). Money printing creates illusory wealth and buys time, but if it was truly the answer to a deleveraging cycle, Zimbabwe would be a member of the G10 (forget where I first saw that, maybe it was Proverbs, but it deserves mention at the very least). Rosenberg says investors bullish on equities had better be aware of the reason why they are bullish: either they expect earnings growth, or they expect the valuation multiple to expand.

flickr/woorldeconomicforumFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is outspoken about her views on gender stereotypes and how they can hold women back. That's the subject of her upcoming book, "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead." She spoke about the issue on a panel last Friday in Davos, arguing that managers reflect unconscious stereotypes when they say things like, "She's great at her job but she's just not as well liked by her peers," or, "She's a bit aggressive."  Sandberg also spoke about the persistence of gender roles in the household, report Heather Stewart and Graham Wearden at the Guardian:  "Sandberg also criticized the fact that it is still assumed women will take on the majority of the caring responsibilities at home, even when both parents work. "Women still have two jobs in the most developed countries around the world; men have one." She added: 'From the moment they leave school, the messages for women are different: 'Don't you want to have kids one day?'" That's in line with earlier statements she's made about the fundamental and very problematic assumptions that remain in society. Women are constantly asked if they want to have kids, while husbands of successful wives are asked†"Are you doing OK?"† It's why she argues that choosing a partner is the most important career choice women make.† Even though she was on stage with some of the most powerful women in the world, including IMF director Christine Lagarde, only 17 percent of Davos delegates are women. In terms of both inclusion, and attitude, there's clearly a long way to go.† NOW SEE: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg And Her Husband Have Done The Impossible

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. 10 Business Lessons From The Beatles (Money &amp; Markets) Josh Brown finds investing and finance-related lessons in almost every book he picks up.¬† Drawing on Bob Spitz's The Beatles: The Biography Brown puts together 10 lessons he learned from The Beatles that apply in business and investing. Some of these include collaboration - "Are you surrounded by the right people, people whose own talent inspires you and pushes you to develop your own skills?" Or don't make the same mistake twice. Dick Rowe famously rejected The Beatles and about two years later Beatlemania was gripping London. "Less than two years later, as the early stages of Beatlemania are gripping London, Dick Rowe bumps into George Harrison at a concert. All is forgiven by now, of course, but the label executive mentions to Harrison that he‚Äôs on the lookout for talent. George mentions the Beatles‚Äô friends, the Rolling Stones, and before he can get the rest of the sentence out of his mouth, Rowe is off like a shot." Brown's takeaway, think about opportunities you're overlooking. We Could Be Witnessing The Dawn Of A New Stock Market Super Cycle (Fidelity)  Stocks have gone sideways for almost a decade, though some have called it a secular bear market. Now, Jurrien Timmer at Fidelity writes that we may be entering a secular bull market.¬† Looking at the S&amp;P 500 since 1871, Timmer writes that on average secular bear markets last 14.5 years. And we seem to be in the thirteenth year of prolonged periods of below-average returns and by historical patterns this is likely to end soon.¬† "This study of market history seems to suggest that maybe the worst is over. If so, it will be important for investors to take a close look at their portfolios to make sure they are not too defensively positioned and that their investment mix is in line with their long-term goals." He does however warn that not everyone feels the same way and that pension funds in particular have lowered their risk profiles. Hedge Funds Are Selling Stocks And Private Investors Are Buying Them (Bank of America) Bank of America's Savita Subramanian writes that hedge funds are selling stocks to private investors who have increased their purchases.¬† "Net buys were $1.22bn, the largest since November, and continued to be led by private clients. Private clients have now been net buyers for four consecutive weeks, a sharp reversal from their large net sales ahead of the Fiscal Cliff late last year. "Institutional clients were also net buyers last week after two weeks of net sales, while hedge funds were the sole net sellers. Pension funds, a subset of institutional clients, were net sellers for the fourth consecutive week."

All This Talk About A 'Great Rotation' In 2013 Is Bunk (Citi)  Some have said the big theme in 2013 will be the 'Great Rotation' from money out of bonds to stocks. Some have said those that speak of a 'Great Rotation' don't understand how markets work. Citi's Tobias Levkovich says such a scenario is over a year away and that current data being used doesn't paint a clear picture.¬† "A so-called Great Rotation towards stocks has not developed from the evidence that can be compiled recently. The data on US equity mutual fund flows have been mixed based on different tracking sources. Indeed, one mutual fund flow data provider reported outflows during January while others suggested there were significant weekly inflows. "‚Ä¶Note, we suspect that investors will need to be convinced by five-year return numbers showing equities outperforming bonds and that means it may take another year for the rotation to develop (since the tough 1Q09 will have to be ‚Äúanniversaried‚Äù away)." Six Mistakes Investors Often Make (The Globe And Mail)  Duke University professor Dan Ariely and Rotman School of Management researcher Nina Mazar write that there are six common mistakes that investors make. 1) Saving - people save too little and spend too much should 2) Retirement - most people assume we need 60 - 70 percent of current income for retirement, studies suggest it is actually closer to 135 percent 3) Insurance - people hate deductibles and often end up choosing more expensive policies in the long run 4) Shopping - we invest in extended warranties even though we know they're bad deals and just profit the vendor 5) Mortgages - do your research and don't just buy mortgages from the same mortgage originators 6) Don't become victim to the 'state quo bias' by sticking with a plan because it's what you first chose.
Getty Images Entertainment/ Stephen Lovekin/StaffLast month, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square, attacked Herbalife, the multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products. Now the company appears to be stepping up its defense and preparing a counter-attack. Herbalife has registered a bunch of Bill Ackman domain names.† And they look as though they might be used as a direct assault on the hedge fund manager. The New York Post's Michelle Celarier reports that Herbalife now owns "therealbillackman.com, "billackman.net" and the "realackman.net" since January 18. †The sites aren't active (yet). Last month, Ackman gave a 342-slide presentation at a Sohn Conference in Manhattan calling Herbalife a pyramid scheme. †His fund is shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife and has a price target of zero. It didn't end there, either. Following the presentation, Ackman's team launched "FactsAboutHerbalife.com" ó a website that features†documents, promotional material from the company, videos and depositions. Ackman also purchased Google Ads when you search for terms related to Herbalife. Herbalife responded immediately to Ackman's presentation saying he used "outdated", "inaccurate" and "distorted" information. †The company also hosted an analyst day in January to rebut Ackman's claims.† Since December 18, the trading session before Bill Ackman confirmed his short, shares of Herbalife are down 5.84%.

Stan Weinstein‚Äôs Secrets For Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets ‚Äì Stan Weinstein: This book was the first to quantify one of the most important concepts in trading; the four stages in which stocks move, which are the basing, advancing, topping, and declining stages.¬† Despite the fact that the cover of this book has not been updated since it was published in 1988, stage analysis is still relevant today. How to Make Money In Stocks ‚Äì O‚ÄôNeil:¬† As an unnamed trader friend of mine recently said, all you need to do is review the charts in the first 150 pages of this book and you will be good to go.¬†¬†¬† These charts along with O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs annotations, give you a great foundation to understand the patterns stocks form before they go on massive runs. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator ‚Äì Edwin Lefevre:¬† Tough call on this book, only because I don‚Äôt think it is the Rosetta Stone of trading books like it is often described as.¬† The language is dated and colloquial, which though strange, is actually part of its charm. There are definitely some foundational lessons for trading in this book, but you as the reader have to do the historical conversion in your head from venue‚Äôs like ‚Äúbucket shops,‚Äù to today‚Äôs market. How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market ‚Äì Nicolas Darvas: This book should really be called, ‚ÄúHow I Made$18,000,000 (Adjusted for Inflation) in the Stock Market,‚Äù because that is how much it would be in today‚Äôs dollars.¬† That would be phenomenal for anybody, but for someone who did it while traveling the globe, in a pre-internet, computer, iPad, Smart phone world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶while working as a professional dancer?¬† Well that is just epic. His ‚ÄúDarvas Box‚Äù system, though crude and in need of adjustment to factor in today‚Äôs HFT, is still a foundation of a solid trading style/discipline. Trading Education: The Stock Twits Edge ‚Äì Howard Lindzon:¬† Okay, before you accuse me of trying to kiss the ass of my blog overlords at StockTwits, let me just tell you that I was recommending this book publicly, way before I ever resurrected this blog, let alone was asked to join the network.¬† This is the book I wish was written when I started trading 25 years ago.¬† The irony though is that it could not really have been written until just recently.¬† It is the ‚ÄúMarket Wizards‚Äù for the retail trader, and more importantly, each chapter is written by someone who currently has an active presence on social media. Plus it‚Äôs the only place you will ever see @The_Real_Fly write two whole pages without saying ‚Äúfuck!‚Äù The Trading Book ‚Äì Anne-Marie Baiynd:¬† I like Anne-Marie, but if she had asked me if it was a wise choice to add another trading book to the world, I would have advised against it.¬† I would have been wrong.¬† I was amazed at the scope of material that this book was able to cover, and do so in a meaningful way. Anne-Marie‚Äôs economical (and often humorous) style, takes you right to the core of each concept, doing away with irrelevant and superfluous information.¬† I don‚Äôt think it is hyperbole to say it is an instant classic for the beginning/intermediate trader. Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques ‚Äì Steve Nisson:¬† There are a lot of books out these on candlestick charting, but almost all of them are derivative of Nisson‚Äôs tome.¬† It goes through and explains the basis concepts, as well as the most relevant patterns, related to candlestick charting.¬† Unless you really need to know about the ‚Äúthree-drunk-salarymen-rolled-by-the-hooker-in-the-Shinjuku-train-station‚Äù pattern, this book is all you will ever need for candlesticks. Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom ‚Äì Van Tharp:¬† Yes the title is cheesy and sounds like something from a late-night infomercial, but this book has one of the best overviews of the different types of methodologies you can use to make money in the markets.¬† But more importantly, it shows you how to go about formulating a methodology for trading in the markets.¬† The information on risk and position sizing alone makes the book worthwhile. Psychology: The Disciplined Trader¬† &amp; Trading In The Zone ‚Äì Mark Douglas:¬† These are the definitive books on trading psychology.¬† I know traders who went from perpetual losers to consistent winners after reading these books.¬† The way Douglas climbs into the psyche of a trader is scary, and there is a good chance you will wonder aloud how he managed to plant the hidden camera and microphones that he used to take notes on your trading deficiencies. Real World Trading: Pit Bull ‚Äì Buzz ‚ÄúBuzzy‚Äù Schwartz: Extremely dated, but still the only full auto-biography (I believe) of a ‚ÄúMarket Wizard.‚Äù¬† It is a look into the mind and process of an extremely disciplined trader who is still putting up crushing numbers to this day.¬† And despite the fact that he shares James Altucher‚Äôs somewhat dubious scatological advice regarding ‚Äúcleaning out the plumbing‚Äù before starting the day, it‚Äôs a good read.¬† I don‚Äôt even know how this is legal, but you can read the whole book online for free here. One Good Trade ‚Äì Mike Bellafiore:¬† If you want to know what it‚Äôs like trading in the real world of a prop firm, this is the book.¬† But even more so, this book shows you how to focus on process instead profits to become a successful trader.¬† There are a number of great trading lessons in this book, all wrapped around relatable stories (kinda like a blog I know).¬† The writing is a bit rough, but then again it‚Äôs not meant to be Shakespeare. General Interest: The 50 Best (and Worst) Business Deals of All Time ‚Äì Michael Craig:¬† This book is like eating a piece of candy; you will enjoy it so much but before you know it, it will be done.¬† Clocking in at under 200 pages, it gives concise, informative, and fascinating insights into some well-known, and some not so well-know business successes and failures.¬† The chapter about the ABA‚Äôs settlement with the ‚ÄúSpirits of St. Louis‚Äù alone is worth the price of admission. Backstage Wall Street: An Insider‚Äôs Guide to Knowing Who to Trust, Who to Run From, and How to Maximize Your Investments ‚Äì Joshua Brown:¬† I am cheating here a bit, because as I write this, I am only half-way through the book; but that half alone is strong enough to put it on my list.¬† Sure, once again you can accuse me of ‚Äúkissing ass‚Äù to one of the heavyweights of financial blogging, but really‚Ä¶.if you have read Josh‚Äôs blog for any amount of time, you know he‚Äôs the real deal.¬† This book pulls no punches, and will probably be looked back upon years from now as the clarion call against the entrenched Wall Street establishment (though I still think most of the Occupy Wall Street crowd are a bunch of douches). Mean Business ‚Äì Al Dunlap:¬† Dunlap made his name as a ‚Äúturn-around‚Äù specialist for near-death companies, and this book chronicles some of his most famous successes. I get that Dunlap‚Äôs career ended in shareholder actions, SEC investigations, and his banning from ever running a public company again.¬† But just because Michael Jackson‚Äôs final few albums sucked doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚ÄúOff the Wall‚Äù and ‚ÄúThriller‚Äù weren‚Äôt masterpieces.¬† Dunlap was an asshole to be sure, but often times an asshole is what is needed, and his excesses in restructuring were merely a response to the bloated corporate excesses of the times.¬† It‚Äôs hard to fool guys like Kerry Packer, Sir James Goldsmith, and the principles at KKR, so ‚ÄúChainsaw‚Äù Al must have been doing something right at some point. The New Financial Capitalists: KKR and the Creation of Corporate Value ‚Äì George P. Baker:¬† Love them or hate them, KKR changed the way M&amp;A was done, and left an imprint on corporate financing that is still felt today.¬† It is hard to forget in the wake of the recent credit crisis, that KKR was always responsible, and almost always successful in using debt and leverage to save failing companies and create or unlock value for shareholders and their investors.¬† This is an authorized biography of the company, but done in a truly objective fashion, and highlights how the key to a KKR deal did not so much have to do with the money (debt) that they brought to the table, but the wealth of managerial talent they brought to their target companies. Avoids: Trading For A Living ‚Äì Alexander Elder:¬† This is the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù book that every new trader seems to come through on the road to trading, but¬† I have to say, I have never been a fan of Dr. Elder.¬† It stems for my suspicion that he makes (and has always made) more money from writing about trading and putting on overpriced seminars on trading, than he has from actually trading.¬† In this book he espouses a multiple time frame method that is rudimentary at best and his nod to trading psychology is done better and in more depth by Douglas.¬† The only interesting aspect of this book is his explanation of how trading is NOT a zero sum game, but that is really only worthy of a blog post at most. The Education of a Speculator ‚Äì Victor Neiderhoffer:¬† I have a blog friend, who not only is a 100x better trader than I could ever hope to be, but is a connoisseur of art and literature, and even surfs.¬† He is also a friend of Neiderhoffer‚Äôs and thinks highly of him.¬† That is why it pains me to say that ‚ÄúEducation‚Ä¶‚Äù is probably one of the top 5 worst written books I have ever read.¬† It would be better titled, ‚ÄúLet Me Tell You What A Great Squash Player I Am.‚Äù¬† And even though I am sure there was meant to be some subtext in his narcissistic stories that relate to trading, it is written in such a purposefully exclusionary way that you can‚Äôt find it.¬† Since I am part of the ‚Äúchattering classes‚Äù it is probably that Neiderhoffer, a true intellect, is just writing above my level, but unless you are picking this book up on the way to your Nobel Prize luncheon, it‚Äôs probably best to just skip it.

Stocks have staged a remarkable rally with no major corrections. In a new research note to clients, Citi global equity strategist Robert Buckland discusses what happens after 20 percent rallies in the stock markets.¬† Specifically, he looks for what the key drivers were that extended previous 20% rallies. "Our study of previous +20% rallies shows that for equities to fly there needs to be a combination of (1) lower than average starting valuations, (2) double digit EPS growth, (3) rising PMIs, (4) higher US government bond yields and, (5) sustained flows into equities," wrote Buckland. Most of those points may seem pretty obvious.¬† But the point about rising government bond yields isn't always intuitive. Here's Buckland on bond yields (emphasis ours): Bond market confirmationRising profits and improving economic activity are often not enough for market momentum to be sustained. Often the improving environment for equities needs to be mirrored by a deterioration for fixed income investors. We find the first 20% gain in markets is often accompanied with stable bond yields (we use US treasuries). But for markets to make double digit gains from here we usually need to see core government bonds yields rise by 50 basis points or more. They tend to decline by 80 basis points when markets fall from here (Figure 8). We believe rising bond yields help equity markets in two ways. First, higher yields drive a steeper yield curve which has previously been a robust forward indicator of future economic and profits growth. While QE has weakened the signaling effect of the yield curve, there are still many who take their guide for economic activity and equities from the bond market. Second, falling bond prices encourage a shift of money back into equities, as investors chase returns. In the case of pension funds, higher yields, in theory, should reduce the present value of future liabilities and free up more cash to allocate to riskier assets. This leads us to the next element investors should consider at this stage of a bull market. 
Bloomberg Markets 50Citi's Tobias Levkovich is one of the more bullish strategists on the Street when it comes to where the stock market is headed from here. In fact, he thinks we're on the verge of a big, secular bull market (he calls it the "Resurgent Raging Bull" thesis). However, even though Levkovich is bullish, he says a "Great Rotation" scenario that many envision in 2013 ñ wherein investors pull money from bond funds and "rotate" it into equities ñ is probably over a year away. Contrast with BofA strategists, who say the "Great Rotation" has already arrived. In his latest note to clients, Levkovich writes that the data on equity flows so far in January that has been driving the buzz about the "Great Rotation" doesn't really paint that clear of a picture: In addition, a so-called Great Rotation towards stocks has not developed from the evidence that can be compiled recently. The data on US equity mutual fund flows have been mixed based on different tracking sources. Indeed, one mutual fund flow data provider reported outflows during January while others suggested there were significant weekly inflows. Furthermore, though many are talking about a "1994 scenario" ñ a mad rush for the exits in the bond market ñ Levkovich doesn't really think that is plausible. Investors usually take a longer view, writes Levkovich, and that means a big rotation out of bonds may not happen for another year: Note, we suspect that investors will need to be convinced by five-year return numbers showing equities outperforming bonds and that means it may take another year for the rotation to develop (since the tough 1Q09 will have to be ìanniversariedî away). We have heard some suggest that individual investors will exit the fixed income asset class once bond funds suffer losses, but we would remind readers that the tech bubble peaked in March 2000 and aggressive growth funds only began to witness consistent outflows in mid-2002; a full 26 months later. Hence, at the first sign of bond fund losses, we deem it doubtful that people will immediately give up on a 30-year bond rally. We would further highlight that our survey in early January showed institutional clients actually raised their cash position as a percent of assets under management despite the marketís appreciation since last summer. Of course, there are other factors that don't have to do with rotations that underpin Citi's bullish thesis. Levkovich writes: Moreover, household deposits nearly have doubled in the past decade to almost $9 trillion (see Figure 4), currently earning a negative real yield, which provides a flood of new money flow†potential that has yet to develop. And, corporate balance sheets are in fine shape with substantial cash positions that can be deployed. Thus, one easily can contend that there is lots of dry powder on the sidelines that can make its way into the stock market if confidence in the economy and government recovers. However, Levkovich, echoing many others, says investors should be cautious in the near term after the recent runup in stocks.

Vimeo screengrabFormer London-based investment banker-turned-sex therapist Mike Lousada, who was dubbed the "orgasm guru" by British GQ, has revealed Wall Streeters' biggest problems in bed. eFinancial Careers' Sarah Butcher reports:† "There are two problems with men in banking," he said. "One is erectile dysfunction (ED). The other is premature ejaculation (PE). Both are linked to the nature of banking jobs." Lousada said male bankers are prone to ED because they suffer from performance anxiety. "Banking is a performance-related, competitive culture. If you work in an environment which emphasizes performance so heavily, it creates a mindset that spills out into other areas of your life." Lousada, who spent spent twenty years working in the City (London's version of Wall Street) at Barclays, SocGen, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura, describes himself as psychosexual body worker.† This definitely isn't your typical career that you would segue into after a long stint on the Street, so we decided to learn a litte more.† Here's what we now know about Lousada's profession:†
Just after the election, many Canadians were convinced President Obama would approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now they're not so sure. "It's anybody's guess what's going to happen with Keystone XL," Calgary Mayor¬†Naheed Nenshi¬†told Reuters' Chrystia Freeland in Davos recently. "The feeling in Canada over the last four or five weeks has become somewhat less optimistic about this thing being built." Nenshi said the President offered few clues in his Inaugural Address about the fate of the project, which would deliver Canadian crude products to the Gulf Coast. "I felt like a Kremlinologist back in the day," he said. "I thought it was interesting that he spoke about climate change, but at the same time he spoke about economic growth in different ways, so I'm not sure what to make of it." Nenshi said the amount of attention the project has received is disproportionate to its likely environmental impact. "Not building this is not going to get us to a low carbon economy, and I think it's a shame, that a one-meter diameter pipe is suddenly having to wear all the sins of the carbon economy we've created."

Stocks have headed higher without respite to start 2013. Many strategists are warning that a sell-off is in order (see here and here), especially given a wide range of indicators that suggest investor sentiment is at historical highs. Today, we get an indication from BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian that hedge funds are now selling stocks ‚Äì and they're selling them to private investors, who are picking up their pace of buying. Below is a chart showing that BofA "private clients," or individual investors, have been buying stocks since mid-January: BofA Merrill Lynch Meanwhile, hedge funds are doing the exact opposite: BofA Merrill Lynch Subramanian writes (emphasis added): Net buys were $1.22bn, the largest since November, and continued to be led by private clients. Private clients have now been net buyers for four consecutive weeks, a sharp reversal from their large net sales ahead of the Fiscal Cliff late last year. Institutional clients were also net buyers last week after two weeks of net sales, while hedge funds were the sole net sellers. Pension funds, a subset of institutional clients, were net sellers for the fourth consecutive week. Just so you know. SEE ALSO: BofA Declares: The Great Rotation Is Here &gt;

Fidelity InvestmentsDespite its huge rally from its March 2009 low, the stock market has effectively gone sideways for the last decade. Many have characterized the current market as a secular bear market. But in a new research report, Fidelity portfolio manager Jurrien Timmer writes that from a technical perspective, this secular bear may be turning into a secular bull. Timmer examined how the S&amp;P 500 has been performing since 1871 and discovered that on average, prolonged periods of below-average returns, or secular bear markets, last about 14.5 years on average. By that measure, the secular bear market that we're currently in is "getting a bit long in the tooth" now that it's in its 13th year, and going by historical patterns, is likely to end. But it's no sure thing that we are entering a bullish super-cycle.¬† Many investors, especially pension funds that have lowered their risk profiles dramatically, aren't really expecting the market to go into a secular bull market. Nevertheless, Timmer thinks that the end of this bear market isn't too far off. "This study of market history seems to suggest that maybe the worst is over," he writes. "If so, it will be important for investors to take a close look at their portfolios to make sure they are not too defensively positioned and that their investment mix is in line with their long-term goals." Timmer took a close look at each of the previous secular bull and bear markets.
Via Jefferies, the global investment banking firm, here are the most polluted cities in the world, by continent. They are ranked according to their annual average levels of airborne particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less (PM-10). These tiny particles are the most likely to cause adverse health effects on the respiratory system, including asthma and trouble breathing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends that yearly averages not exceed 50 micrograms per square meter (ug/m3).¬† The EPA says:  Major concerns for human health from exposure to PM-10 include: effects on breathing and respiratory systems, damage to lung tissue, cancer, and premature death. The elderly, children, and people with chronic lung disease, influenza, or asthma, are especially sensitive to the effects of particulate matter. Acidic PM-10 can also damage human-made materials and is a major cause of reduced visibility in many parts of the U.S. Here's the chart: Jefferies SEE MORE: Stunning Photos Of The Energy Of The Future &gt;
American Enterprise InstituteYou know the deficit argument is all but over when one conservative tells other conservatives to shut up about it, already.American Enterprise Institute's¬† John H. Makin has a long new argument today, in which he said that worrying about national debt is a nonsensical idea because Japan's national debt isn't hurting them any, and really, the U.S. has other stuff to worry about. Like fixing the tax code, or reforming entitlement programs. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which is what many conservatives tout as a metric of how "unsustainable" U.S. debt is, means absolutely nothing, he said. Japan, for instance, has a debt-to-GDP ration of 140, which is way above the U.S. number, and it really hasn't had any effect whatsoever on their economy. American Enterprise InstituteIn fact, the interest rate for 10-year Japanese bonds are half that of the American equivalent, in part because of Japanese deflation.From the his note: Congress, take note. Although American deficits do need to be reduced and debt accumulation does need to be slowed and eventually reversed, cries of imminent disaster from ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù deficits and a supposed bond market collapse will not accomplish this goal. Persistently rising bond prices in Japan and the United States have undercut the ‚Äúsky-is-falling‚Äù rationale for deficit reduction. In fact, austerity could just about be the silliest thing to do, if Congress wants the debt-to-GDP ratio to fall: If fiscal austerity is applied too rapidly, US growth will drop and the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise, boosting the nation‚Äôs debt burden. If the Fed tries to stem the rise with too much money printing, inflation could rise and drive up interest rates, exacerbating the US debt burden. Congress and the president need to avoid excessive austerity with respect to changes in fiscal policy this year. Over the past four years, on average, the fiscal boost applied to the American economy has been worth about 3 percent of GDP. This year, with tax increases and sequestration, fiscal drag will be about 1.5 percent of GDP. According to Makin, instead of yelling about how the world is going end and whatnot, which would only serve to sap the momentum to sound fiscal policy, Congress should be cutting deficits gradually, through tax reform and by rethinking how entitlement programs work. Instead of bellowing about a disaster that never comes and saps the momentum from sound fiscal policy, Congress should be cutting deficits through reforming entitlement programs and lowering tax rates while closing tax loopholes. The aim of these measures is to enhance economic growth. Recognizing and striving to achieve the benefits of a sound fiscal policy will produce more progress on deficit reduction and debt stabilization than will empty threats of soaring interest rates and bond market collapse.

Consumer confidence declined to 58.6 from 66.7 in December. That was well below expectations. So, the question is simple. What caused it? Was it the fact that the payroll tax jumped, and people were reacting to their new, lower take-home pay? Or was it about DC uncertainty? Nomura writes: While the cutoff date of the January survey was January 17, the political agreement on the fiscal cliff did not help consumer sentiment improve. Because we think that many households still have not fully realized the impact of the expiration of the payroll tax holiday as yet, there is the possibility that consumer confidence could decline further in the coming months. The Conference Board said ìThe increase in the payroll tax has undoubtedly dampened consumersí spirits and it may take a while for confidence to rebound and consumers to recover from their initial paycheck shock.î Here's a chart which shows the dive.

Bo Xilai did not go on trial Monday, frustrating the many foreign reporters went to Guiyang on the basis of thin reporting, as Reuters writes in dead end trail to Bo trial in China's south: A report last week in a Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper prompted dozens of reporters to travel to the sleepy city of Guiyang expecting to cover the trial of the man who was once considered a contender for China's top leadership. The paper has been known to reliably report news Chinese state media won't touch. Reuters, the first Western newswire to run with the Ta Kung Pao story, did not mention its claim the previous day that "a third source, who has ties to the leadership, said the trial would in fact begin on Monday in Guiyang." Those nebulous "ties to the leadership" sources have been the downfall of many a story about Chinese politics...Is this source who has "ties to the leadership" now on an "unreliable source" list inside Reuters, and did his/her information contribute to previous stories?

Given the high-profile of the Bo case it is highly unlikely the government will not announce a trial date in advance, even if all or part of the proceedings are held in secret, as they were in the Wang Lijun trial. Bloomberg reports that Bo Xilaiís supporters demonstrated outside the Guiyang courthouse: ìSecretary Bo, corrupt and incompetent officials envy you, the people love you,î said the red banner with gold letters, held by a man and a woman outside the Guiyang Intermediate Peopleís Court in the southern province of Guizhou. The two folded up the banner and left after about a minute. The Bloomberg story is a bit ambiguous, but it sounds like there were just two demonstrators.

It was the latest development in a scandal that has cost 11 Chongqing officials their jobs for allegedly appearing in secretly filmed sex videos. Zhu Ruifeng, a citizen journalist who reports official corruption, addressed a small gathering of media representatives in front of a police station in Xicheng district after being questioned, alleging that Chongqing police were not interested in protecting whistle-blowers, just capturing them. And he defiantly said he would continue to expose official malfeasance.<U+4EBA><U+6C11><U+65E5><U+62A5>-<U+4E2D><U+5171><U+4E2D><U+592E><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+5C40><U+53EC><U+5F00><U+4F1A><U+8BAE> <U+7814><U+7A76><U+90E8><U+7F72><U+52A0><U+5F3A><U+65B0><U+5F62><U+52BF><U+4E0B><U+515A><U+5458><U+53D1><U+5C55><U+548C><U+7BA1><U+7406><U+5DE5><U+4F5C> <U+4E2D><U+5171><U+4E2D><U+592E><U+603B><U+4E66><U+8BB0><U+4E60><U+8FD1><U+5E73><U+4E3B><U+6301><U+4F1A><U+8BAE> -

NYTimes.com- Jin Canrong, an international affairs professor at Renmin University of China, said Mr. Kerry would be less aggressive toward China than Mrs. Clinton has been, according to China Daily. China disliked Mrs. Clintonís central role in the Obama administrationís turn toward Asia, which has been interpreted by many here as an effort to contain China. Michael OíHanlon of the Brookings Institution said Mrs. Clintonís role in the administrationís ìpivot to Asiaî and her tough stance toward China were arguably ìher greatest and most memorable contributionî as secretary of state, as my colleague David Rohde reported.
The British pound has fallen out of favor among currency investors so far in 2013. Since hitting a high of 1.6379 against the U.S. dollar on January 1, the pound sterling has tumbled nearly 4 percent to today's levels around 1.5735 (click to enlarge):  Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Head of FX Research Kit Juckes says that at this point, "Sentiment towards sterling is getting to be about as¬†negative as it can usefully be." Juckes says three bearish arguments for holding pounds are all hitting the market at once: Meanwhile, the euro has surged since the latest ECB policy meeting, when ECB President Mario Draghi suggested that there was no discussion on cutting interest rates. Now, the consensus view is that the ECB is beginning to tighten policy, which is supporting the euro's climb higher against other major currencies like the pound sterling. Juckes writes in a note to clients that the pound can keep going lower, too: What can undermine sterling even more than the dollar is the vulnerability to reduced investment flows and the continued weakness of the economy. The UK is a small open economy that has benefited from capital inflows because it is NOT in the euro area but IS in the EU. The former is less helpful now, the uncertainty about the latter a clear negative. The result could be to take EUR/GBP close to 0.90 before the long-term downtrend resumes. All of these factors, Juckes says, have turned the pound sterling into the "whipping-boy of FX markets."
Robert Johnson ‚Äî Business InsiderEach Canadian is providing each American with an approximately $1,200 energy discount thanks to the lack of crude oil infrastructure, according to the¬†CEO of a Canadian oilsands company. The Canadian Press news agency¬†says Cenovus chief Brian Ferguson told a CIBC investor conference that producers operating in Alberta's oil sands have practically run out of markets because all existing pipelines are at full capacity. In other words, the Canadian supply cannot reach other international export markets. As a result of this supply overload, Canadian crude product prices have been severely discounted. A similar scenario just got resolved in the U.S. with the construction of the Oklahoma-to-the-Gulf Seaway Pipeline: too much idling product was bringing down prices, but the new infrastructure will allow some of the so-called Midcontinent market to clear. "A lack of pipeline capacity is a major issue not just for the industry, but for Canadians," the Press quotes Ferguson as saying.¬† "The differentials have had a big impact on Alberta's all-important oil revenues, with Finance Minister Doug Horner warning earlier this week that his March 7 budget will not be a 'fun' one," the agency reports. The U.S. imports a little more than 80 million barrels of oil a month from Canada. SEE MORE:¬†The 11 Factors That Determine Gas Prices &gt;
MSNBC host and POLITICO columnist Joe Scarborough has a piece up today titled Paul Krugman vs. The World. It's about Paul Krugman's ostensibly contrarian views on the deficit and the national debt. Here's how it's teased on the POLITICO homepage.  The article says: Paul Krugman favors running deeper deficits, but folks like the chief of the Council on Foreign Relations, Erskine Bowles, Scarborough himself, Mika Brzezinski, Steven Rattner, and former Joint Chief chairman Michael Mullen all disagree with Krugman. Note that zero of the above people are "economists" let alone mainstream economists. But actually there are plenty of economists and economically-literate minds who think that, to varying degrees, the deficit is not what we should be worrying about. For Joe Scarborough's sake, here's a list of people. With each we've linked to comments they've made about their (lack of) worry about the deficit. Anyway, that was just a partial list, but one that covers conservatives, liberals, Wall Street economists, and former government officials. Note that several of them, including Paul Krugman himself, do acknowledge long-term issues arising from health care costs, so even the idea that Krugman wants to do nothing is a falsehood. The issue is not as one-sided as Scarborough believes. SEE ALSO: Richard Koo: Why we shouldn't even be talking about the long-term deficit &gt;
The state-sponsored chorus about the end of the debt crisis in the Eurozone has been deafening. It even has feel-good metrics: the Euro Breakup Index for January fell to 17.2%‚Äîthe percentage of investors who thought that at least one country would leave the Eurozone within twelve months. In July, it stood at 73%. For Cyprus, the fifth Eurozone country to ask for a bailout, the index fell to 7.5%. ‚ÄúA euro breakup is almost no issue anymore among investors,‚Äù the statement said. Just then, in a fight over whether or not to bail out Cyprus, top Eurocrats exposed what a taxpayer-funded con game they thought these bailouts really were‚Äîand how fragile the Eurozone was. A debate has been raging in Germany about Cyprus. Not that the German parliament, which has a say in this, wouldn‚Äôt rubber-stamp an eventual bailout, as it rubber-stamped others before, but right now they‚Äôre not in the mood. Cyprus is too much of a mess. Bailing out uninsured depositors of Cypriot banks would set a costly precedent for other countries. And bailing out Russian ‚Äúblack money,‚Äù which makes up a large portion of the deposits, would be, well, distasteful in Germany, a few months before the federal elections. For the tiny country whose economy is barely a rounding error in the Eurozone, it would be an enormous bailout. At ‚Ç¨17.5 billion, it would amount to about 100% of GDP: ‚Ç¨10 billion for the banks, ‚Ç¨6 billion for holders of existing debt, and ‚Ç¨1.5 billion to cover budget deficits through 2016. The new debt, a ‚Ç¨2.5 billion loan that Russia extended in 2011, and other debt would amount to 150% of GDP, according to Moody‚Äôs. Unsustainable. So haircuts would be necessary. But whose hair would be cut? As always, there is never an alternative to a bailout. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential that everybody realizes that a disorderly default of Cyprus could lead to an exit of Cyprus from the Eurozone,‚Äù said Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. ‚ÄúIt would be extremely stupid to take any risk of that nature.‚Äù A risk German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble would be willing to take. He‚Äôd been saying publicly that it wasn‚Äôt certain yet that a default would put the Eurozone at risk‚Äî‚Äùone of the requirements that any bailout money can flow at all,‚Äù he said. Cyprus simply wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsystemically important.‚Äù In fact, there were alternatives. Heretic words. He needed to be shut up, apparently. And that happened at the meeting of Eurozone finance ministers a week ago, details of which sources just leaked to the Spiegel. The meeting was marked by the transfer of the Eurogroup presidency from Jean-Claude Juncker to the new guy, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Cyprus was also on the agenda, but not much was accomplished, other than an agreement to delay the bailout decision until after the Cypriot general elections in February. The government has resisted certain bailout conditions, such as the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the elimination of cost-of-living adjustments for salaries. Now, everyone wanted to deal with the new government. But what didn‚Äôt make it into the press release was that ECB President Mario Draghi, bailout-fund tsar Klaus Regling, and Olli Rehn, all three unelected officials, had formed a triumvirate to gang up on Sch√§uble. That Cyprus wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsystemically important‚Äù was something he kept hearing everywhere from lawyers, Draghi told Sch√§uble at the meeting. But it wasn‚Äôt a question that can be answered by lawyers, he said. It was a topic for economists. A resounding put-down: Sch√§uble, a lawyer by training‚Äînot an economist‚Äîwasn‚Äôt competent to speak on the issue and should therefore shut up! The two largest Cypriot banks had an extensive network of branches in Greece, the triumvirate argued. If deposits at these branches weren‚Äôt considered safe, Greek depositors would be plunged again into uncertainty, which could then infect Greek banks and cause a serious relapse in Greece.¬†¬† If Cyprus went bust, they contended, it would annihilate the flow of positive news that has been responsible recently for calming down the Eurozone. For weeks, all signs have pointed towards an improvement, they argued. Risk premiums for Spanish and Italian government debt have dropped significantly, and balances between central banks, which had risen to dangerous levels, have been edging down. If the money spigot were turned off, this recovery could reverse, they argued. Contagion would spread and could jeopardize Ireland‚Äôs and Portugal‚Äôs return to the financial markets. Further, Cyprus was carrying its portion of the bailout funds and therefore had a right to its own bailout‚Äîa legal argument even a mere lawyer should be able to grasp. And so, letting tiny Cyprus default could tear up the rest of the Eurozone, they argued‚Äîsaying essentially that bailouts were a delicate con game, and that Sch√§uble, by digging in his heels, was blowing it up. It made for another bitter Eurozone irony: the democratically elected finance minister of a country whose taxpayers have to pay more than any other for the bailouts got shut down by unelected Eurocrats who, in a continued power grab, postulated that Cypriot banks, their bondholders, their depositors, even their uninsured depositors, even Russian ‚Äúblack money‚Äù depositors had a ‚Äúright‚Äù to the German money (and anyone else‚Äôs). And if Sch√§uble refused, it would blow up the entire Eurozone. Sch√§uble‚Äôs response hasn‚Äôt bubbled to the surface yet. And bailout queen Chancellor Merkel, who is trying to avoid tumult ahead of her elections, has a new headache. Read...¬† Russian ‚ÄúBlack Money‚Äù Threatens To Boot Cyprus Out Of The¬†Eurozone.
GettyUPDATE: The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey for the month of January is out. Click here to refresh for updates &gt; The headline number fell to 58.6, well below expectations of a drop to 64.0. Last month's number was revised higher to 66.7 from 65.1, meaning the drop is even steeper than it appears at first blush. Below, the full release: 29 Jan. 2013¬† New York, January 29, 2013‚Ä¶The Conference Board¬†Consumer Confidence Index¬Æ, which had declined in December, fell further in January. The Index now stands at 58.6 (1985=100), down from 66.7 in December. The Expectations Index declined to 59.5 from 68.1. The Present Situation Index decreased to 57.3 from 64.6 last month. The monthly¬†Consumer Confidence Survey¬Æ, based on a probability-design random sample, is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was January 17. Says Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board: ‚ÄúConsumer Confidence posted another sharp decline in January, erasing all of the gains made through 2012. Consumers are more pessimistic about the economic outlook and, in particular, their financial situation. The increase in the payroll tax has undoubtedly dampened consumers‚Äô spirits and it may take a while for confidence to rebound and consumers to recover from their initial paycheck shock.‚Äù Consumers‚Äô appraisal of current conditions deteriorated in January. Those claiming business conditions are ‚Äúgood‚Äù declined to 16.7 percent from 17.2 percent, while those stating business conditions are ‚Äúbad‚Äù increased to 27.4 percent from 26.3 percent. Consumers‚Äô assessment of the labor market has also grown more negative. Those saying jobs are ‚Äúplentiful‚Äù declined to 8.6 percent from 10.8 percent, while those claiming jobs are ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù increased to 37.7 percent from 36.1 percent. Consumers‚Äô optimism about the short-term outlook continued to deteriorate in January. Those expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months declined to 15.4 percent from 18.1 percent. However, those expecting business conditions to worsen declined slightly to 20.6 percent from 21.1 percent. Consumers‚Äô outlook for the labor market was more pessimistic. Those anticipating more jobs in the months ahead declined to 14.3 percent from 17.9 percent, while those expecting fewer jobs remained virtually unchanged at 27.0 percent. The proportion of consumers expecting their incomes to decline rose to 22.9 percent from 19.1 percent, while those anticipating an increase declined to 13.6 percent from 15.6 percent.¬†¬† The next release is scheduled for Tuesday, February 26 at 10 A.M. ----------------- ORIGINAL:¬†Minutes away from the release of the Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence survey, due out at 10 AM ET.

AP Photo Jefferies analysts Laban Yu and Jack Lu argue in a note today that China's epic air pollution is actually saving lives. Wait what? Here's their case: Yes, of course China's smog problems are very real ó they lead the world in premature deaths caused by air pollution: Jefferies But this massive pollution is actually a sign of rising living standards, they write: The difference is that industrialization ñ with its incumbent air pollution ñ eliminates poverty. Among the top twenty nations with air pollution induced premature deaths are the US, Japan, the UK, Germany and Italy ñ all wealthy developed nations. As it turns out,†more people die prematurely in India from problems caused by a lacked of advanced infrastructure like diarrhea and poor ventilation or†burning of coal and animal dung for heat (which they categorize as "indoor air pollution"): Jefferies But a better measure of China's standing on public health is illness, disability and early death (DALY), a metric created by the World Health Organization. By that criteria, China is not even in the top 20 ó† Jefferies And only a few notches behind Brazil: Jefferies Yu and Lu point out that China's air pollution is the fruit of industrialization, and that industrialization is a life saver. The public health effects of air pollution cannot be viewed in isolation. Nobody believes air pollution is a great thing but nations continue to pollute because civilizations make hard choices. And air pollution is not even that hard a choice. Higher cancer rates in old age are the price that China, and many other nations, have chosen to pay for lower death rates from childhood diarrhea.† SEE MORE:†Stunning Photos Of The Energy Of The Future &gt;
JefferiesFederal officials filed criminal and civil charges against former Jefferies senior MBS trader, Jesse Litvak, 38, yesterday for allegedly¬†defrauding investors and the government while selling mortgage-backed securities from 2009 to 2011. Here's a synopsis from the¬†SEC's release¬†(emphasis ours):¬† According to the SEC‚Äôs complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut, Jesse Litvak arranged trades for customers as part of his job as a managing director on the MBS desk at Jefferies.¬† Litvak would buy a MBS from one customer and sell it to another customer, but on many occasions he lied about the price at which his firm had bought the MBS so he could re-sell it to the other customer at a higher price and keep more money for the firm.¬† On other occasions, Litvak misled purchasers by creating a fictional seller to purport that he was arranging a MBS trade between customers when in reality he was just selling MBS out of his firm‚Äôs inventory at a higher price.¬† Because MBS are generally illiquid and difficult to price, it is particularly important for brokers to provide honest and accurate information.¬† The SEC alleges that Litvak generated more than $2.7 million in additional revenue for Jefferies through his deceit.¬† His misconduct helped him improve his own standing at the firm, as his bonuses were determined in part by the amount of revenue he generated for the firm. According to the 16-count indictment from the¬†United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, Litvak's alleged victims include some of the biggest names on the Street such as Soros Fund Management, D.E. Shaw, and Third Point, etc. What's more is six of those alleged victims were funds created by the Treasury Department to help strengthen the MBS market as part of the 2009 bailout plan, the indictment states.¬† The SEC's complaint also gives examples of trades that Litvak allegedly made money from his misconduct including this one from¬†2009 with Wellington Management.¬† On December 23, 2009, Litvak approached a representative at Wellington¬†Management LLP (‚ÄúWellington‚Äù) about purchasing a MBS called Wells Fargo Mortgage Backed¬†Securities 2006-AR12 1a1 (WFMB 06-AR12 1a1). Litvak suggested to the representative that¬†he was arranging a trade with an active outside party:¬† yo yo yo‚Ä¶.if there is any color you can share on your wfmbs 06-ar10 4A1 from yest‚Ä¶maybe i can use that as leverage to go beat the guy up that owns the 06-ar12 1a1¬†bonds‚Ä¶.as of late last nite it sounded like he was starting to warm up to the idea of coming off his level‚Ä¶.. The Wellington representative asked Litvak, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the current size and offer‚Äù on the MBS, and Litvak responded, ‚Äúits 3+mm current and he was offering them at 77‚Ä¶.‚Äù About twenty minutes later, Litvak reported that the seller was not in yet: ‚Äúhe ‚Ä¶ usually rolls in around now‚Ä¶..so should know soon brotha‚Ä¶..‚Äù Half an hour later, Litvak told the Wellington representative that he had bought the MBS at 75-28 and provided details of the supposed negotiation: winner winner chicken dinner‚Ä¶he is gonna sell em to me at 75-28 as I told him to not get cute and just sell the bonds so you can own them at 76‚Ä¶.he said cool‚Ä¶..its 6.23mm orig‚Ä¶.a‚Äôight? Wellington agreed to purchase $6.23 million of the MBS at 76. In actuality, Jefferies had purchased the MBS on December 14, 2009 at 70 (not ‚Äú75-28‚Äù) and held it in its inventory at the time of the sale to Wellington. On December 23, 2009, Litvak concocted the supposed seller and fabricated the details of a negotiation. As he had done before, Litvak lied about the purchase price, Jefferies‚Äô compensation on the trade, and the fact that the MBS was being sold out of Jefferies‚Äô inventory. Through his misconduct, Litvak made over $150,000 in additional compensation for Jefferies on this trade. According to the indictment in U.S. District Court District of Connecticut, he's charged with 11 counts of securities fraud, one count of TARP fraud and four counts of making false statements to the government. ¬† Again, much of Litvak's alleged misconduct happened after the financial crisis.¬†
Yet that continues to be the direction we‚Äôre heading in. A newly-released¬†analysis¬†by the Economic Policy Institute shows that the super-rich have done well in the economic recovery while almost everyone else has done badly. The top 1 percent of earners‚Äô real wages grew 8.2 percent from 2009 to 2011, yet the real annual wages of Americans in the bottom 90 percent have continued to decline in the recovery, eroding by 1.2 percent between 2009 and 2011. In other words, we‚Äôre back to the widening inequality we had before the debt bubble burst in 2008 and the economy crashed.¬† But the President is exactly right. Not even the very wealthy can continue to succeed without a broader-based prosperity. That‚Äôs because 70 percent of economic activity in America is consumer spending. If the bottom 90 percent of Americans are becoming poorer, they‚Äôre less able to spend. Without their spending, the economy can‚Äôt get out of first gear.¬† That‚Äôs a big reason why the recovery continues to be anemic, and why the¬†International Monetary Fund just lowered¬†its estimate for U.S. growth in 2013 to just 2 percent.¬† Almost a quarter of all jobs in America now pay wages below the poverty line for a family of four. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 7 out of 10 growth occupations over the next decade will be low-wage ‚Äî like serving customers at big-box retailers and fast-food chains. At this rate, who‚Äôs going to buy all the goods and services America is capable of producing? We can‚Äôt return to the kind of debt-financed consumption that caused the bubble in the first place. Get it? It‚Äôs not a zero-sum game. Wealthy Americans would do better with smaller shares of a rapidly-growing economy than with the large shares they now possess of an economy that‚Äôs barely moving. If they were rational, the wealthy would support public investments in education and job-training, a world-class infrastructure (transportation, water and sewage, energy, internet), and basic research ‚Äì all of which would make the American workforce more productive. If they were rational they‚Äôd even support labor unions ‚Äì which have proven the best means of giving working people a fair share in the nation‚Äôs prosperity. But labor unions are almost extinct. The decline of labor unions in America tracks exactly the decline in the bottom 90 percent‚Äôs share of total earnings, and shrinkage of the middle class. In the 1950s, when the U.S. economy was growing faster than 3 percent a year, more than a third of all working people belonged to a union. That gave them enough bargaining clout to get wages that allowed them to buy what the economy was capable of producing. Since the late 1970s, unions have eroded ‚Äì as has the purchasing power of most Americans, and not coincidentally, the average annual growth of the economy. Last week the¬†Bureau of Labor Statistics¬†¬†reported that as of 2012 only 6.6 percent of workers in the private sector were unionized. (That‚Äôs down from 6.9 percent in 2011.) That‚Äôs the lowest rate of unionization in almost a century. What‚Äôs to blame? Partly globalization and technological change. Globalization sent many unionized manufacturing plants abroad. Manufacturing is starting to return to America but it‚Äôs returning without many jobs. The old assembly line has been replaced by robotics and numerically-controlled machine tools. Technologies have also replaced many formerly unionized workers in telecommunications (remember telephone operators?) and clerical jobs. But wait. Other nations subject to the same forces have far higher levels of unionization than America. 28 percent of¬†Canada‚Äôs workforce¬†is unionized, as is more than 25 percent of Britain‚Äôs, and almost 20 percent of Germany‚Äôs.¬† Unions are almost extinct in America because we‚Äôve chosen to make them extinct. Unlike other rich nations, our labor laws allow employers to replace striking workers. We‚Äôve also made it exceedingly difficult for workers to organize, and we barely penalized companies that violate labor laws. (A worker who‚Äôs illegally fired for trying to organize a union may, if lucky, get the job back along with back pay ‚Äì after years of legal haggling.) Republicans, in particular, have set out to kill off unions. Union membership dropped 13 percent last year in Wisconsin, which in 2011 curbed the collective bargaining rights of many public employees. And it fell 18 percent last year in Indiana, which last February enacted a right-to-work law (allowing employees at unionized workplaces to get all the benefits of unionization without paying for them). Last month Michigan enacted a similar law. Don‚Äôt blame globalization and technological change for why employees at Walmart, America‚Äôs largest employer, still don‚Äôt have a union. They‚Äôre not in global competition and their jobs aren‚Äôt directly threatened by technology. The average pay of a Walmart worker is $8.81 an hour. A third of Walmart‚Äôs employees work less than 28 hours per week and don‚Äôt qualify for benefits.¬†Walmart is a microcosm of the American economy. It has brazenly fought off unions. But it could easily afford to pay its workers more. It earned $16 billion last year. Much of that sum went to Walmart‚Äôs shareholders, including the family of its founder, Sam Walton. The wealth of the Walton family now exceeds the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of American families combined, according to an¬†analysis¬†by the Economic Policy Institute.¬†But how can Walmart expect to continue to show fat profits when most of its customers are on a downward economic escalator? Walmart should be unionized. So should McDonalds. So should every major big-box retailer and fast-food outlet in the nation. So should every hospital in America. That way, more Americans would have enough money in their pockets to get the economy moving. And everyone ‚Äì even the very rich ‚Äì would benefit. As Obama said,¬†America cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. Read more posts on robertreich.org ¬ª
World Economic Forum via FlikrIf you were looking for a break from the drama surrounding Herbalife, Bill Ackman, and Carl Icahn, look no further. Hedge fund Elliott Management has decided to take its battle to overhaul energy company Hess Corporation to the people, and since that hedge fund is owned by none other than Paul Singer, this will likely be a fascinating fight. Singer is known for bold moves. Last October he convinced a Ghanaian Court to impound an Argentine naval vessel because Argentina owes him (and fellow hedge fund managers) over a $1 billion in unpaid sovereign debt. In short, Singer does not play. That's why he's set up a website ó Reassess Hessó to lay down his argument for why Hess needs a major makeover. Elliott Management owns 4% of Hess common stock and they have five recommendations for what management should do to fix the company ASAP ó elect 5 new board members (Elliott has suggestions on the site), refocus Hess portfolio via spin-offs and divestitures, improve operational focus, and instill capital discipline. From Elliott: Our investment in Hess Corporation is Elliottís largest initial equity investment in its more than 35 year history. The size of the position reflects our conviction that, with proper oversight and guidance from the Shareholder Nominees, tremendous value can be unlocked. In this letter, we lay out our thoughts on how the board can reclaim shareholder value by refocusing the Company. However, our overarching point is this: all of the billions wasted, all of the operational failures, and all of the opacity stems from one central problem: the boardís failure to oversee management and hold it accountable for over a decade of failures. Those are definitely fighting words.
The Case-Shiller house price index came out today, and the numbers were basically in line with expectations. House prices for November were 5.52 percent above last year's levels. We've gotten so used to rising home prices that news that would have been remarkable several months ago is now treated as ho-hum. Former bust cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas and Detroit are among the hottest housing markets. But while housing rebounds nationally, New York is not looking so hot according to the latest Case-Shiller home price report. On Bloomberg TV, Karl Case blamed weak Wall Street bonuses for the slackness. Case-Shiller SEE ALSO: Optimists Are Ignoring Two Key Things About The US Housing Recovery &gt;
Brett Weinstein via FlickrCase-Shiller home prices climbed 5.52 percent year-over-year, in line with expectations of a 5.55 percent rise. This was the highest level since August 2006. On the month they were up 0.63 percent, slightly below expectations of a 0.7 percent rise. In the year-ending November, 19 of the 20 cities included in the index saw home prices rise. Just New York reported a fall in prices. On a monthly basis however the picture wasn't as clean, with just 10 cities seeing home prices rise. "Winter is usually a weak period for housing which explains why we now see about half the cities with falling month-to-month prices compared to 20 out of 20 seeing rising prices last summer," said David Blitzer, Chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Here's a look a the trajectory of 20-city home price index since 2001: S&P Case Shiller ¬† Millan Mulraine at TD Securities writes that "the sustained improvement in home prices has become central to the recent recovery in household wealth, with the $1.3 trillion increase in households' home equity since Q4 2011, accounting for over one-third of the $4.5 trillion increase in household net worth over the same period." But some like Quinn Eddins at RadarLogic argue that the recent rise in home prices reflects the weakness in 2011 home prices, more than strength in 2012 home prices.
Wikimedia CommonsJust breaking now. The head of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, is stepping down. He's considered one of the world's top central bankers. Back in 2011, Mohamed El-Erian endorsed him as a brilliant economist who should take over the IMF. Evan Soltas has pointed out that Fischer has been a de facto champion of NGDP targeting, who has kept the Israeli remarkably stable. In this day of Central Banker poaching (the Bank of England hired Mark Carney from the Bank of Canada), this is an interesting free agency. Here's the full press release from the Bank of Israel. ----------------------------------- The Governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, today informed the Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, of his intention to step down on June 30, 2013, after more than eight years as Governor.† The Governor noted that in addition to the goal of advancing the Israeli economy, one of his† primary goals he had set himself was passing a new Bank of Israel law.† That was done in May 2010. Since then, the Bank has operated successfully within the framework of the new law,†† especially through the† work with the† Monetary Committee and the Supervisory Council.† The Governor said that in the coming months he will continue to deal fully with all matters pertaining to the Bank.† Prof .† Fischer added that he is extremely grateful for the opportunity he has been granted by the Government of Israel to fulfill the task of Governor, especially during a challenging period that included the global economic crisis, a complex geo-political reality, and domestic social issues.†† The Governor thanks the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Knesset, the Members of the Monetary Policy Committee, the Supervisory Council and the management and staff of the Bank of Israel for the privilege of working with them during his term as Governor.† The Governor will hold a press conference tomorrow, Wednesday, January 30th, at 11:00 AM, at the Bank of Israel.

The stock touched a 52-week low of $24.24 on December 24 and rallied back above the pre-Ackman short levels on January 14.¬† Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission went after private Kentucky-based multi-level marketing firm Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing and halted its operations for being an allegedly illegal pyramid scheme pending a trial.¬† Even though Herbalife and other MLMs were not the target of that presser, the action still seemed to send chills throughout the MLM sector with shares of Herbalife, Nu Skin and Blyth all closing lower yesterday.¬† During the press conference, the FTC declined to comment on Herbalife.¬† Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is¬†shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that he believes is a pyramid scheme. After Ackman presented his short case at a special conference last month, hedge fund manager¬†Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, disclosed in January¬†that his fund had snapped up an 8.24% stake in the company on the long side. ¬†Loeb said in a letter to investors that Ackman's short case lacks "merit" and his pyramid scheme allegation is "preposterous."¬† SEE: The Greatest Hedge Fund Brawl In Ages Is Happening Now ‚Äî Here's What You Need To Know &gt;¬†
We've written a lot about one of the biggest catchphrases on Wall Street right now: the "Great Rotation" out of bonds and into equities that many strategists expect sometime in 2013 as economic growth hits an inflection point and investors begin to price in an end to easy money central bank policies. One of the biggest fears in the market right now is that investors could be caught off guard by a surprise surge in interest rates as money flows out of bonds, resulting in a "1994 scenario" wherein the bond market gets crushed. On the other hand, there is the experience of the 1960s. BofA Chief Global Equity Strategist Michael Hartnett says that template is "Bernanke's ideal Great Rotation" in his latest presentation. In the 1960s, equities and risky assets took off ahead of bond yields, much like they have today. However, in the 1960s, yields didn't scream higher right away to catch up to the move, and inflation remained subdued:  SEE ALSO:†MORGAN STANLEY ANALYST: Every Investor I Met At Davos Was Worried About The Same Fed Scenario &gt;

Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple stock has tanked 35% from its all-time high, and now sits at $450. If things go badly for Apple over the next several years, the stock could fall a lot farther from here. But if things go even moderately well, the stock should deliver a compelling return. Why? Because, at $450, the stock looks cheap. At $450, Apple stock is trading at 10X trailing earnings per share. For a company that is still expected to grow, albeit at a much reduced rate, that's an attractive valuation. Importantly, Apple also has $135 billion of cash and no debt. Much of this cash is available to be returned to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and, possibly, dividend increases. So it's worth considering Apple's market value and multiple excluding this cash. Excluding its cash, Apple's business is now valued at about $300 billion, or 2X revenue. Apple's business currently earns about $40 billion a year. So Apple's business is valued at about 7-times earnings. That's an even more attractive valuation. Even when you consider that Apple's earnings are now declining. Think about it this way. If you spent $425 billion to buy Apple today--the whole company, not some shares of stock--you would be able to immediately pocket the $135 billion of Apple's cash. You would then own a business that spits out about $40 billion of cash per year. Assuming the business maintains close to this level of earnings, you would get the remaining ~$300 billion of your purchase price back in about 7-10 years. You would then own all of Apple and its future earnings "for free." Even if Apple's earnings shrink over the next few years--which I actually think is likely (Apple's net income in the next quarter is expected to be down a startling 20% from last year)--it would only take 10-15 years for you to get your money back. If Apple's earnings grew instead of stayed flat, meanwhile--which isn't inconceivable--you would get your money back even faster than 7 years. In other words, unless Apple's earnings really tank, and stay down, you will have bought a good company at a reasonable price. Now, you are not going to be buying all of Apple anytime soon, so you can only think about the description above theoretically. But here is a more likely scenario. A more likely scenario is that Apple's earnings will stay flat or drop over the next several years, and Apple will start to get even more serious about returning some of its massive cash pile to investors. To reiterate: Apple has ~$135 billion of cash. And it is currently generating more cash at a rate of about ~$40 billion per year. Apple has no idea what to do with this money. No company needs $135 billion of cash. In the past, Apple has demonstrated that it is not stupid enough to make huge, bad acquisitions (at least so far). So one can hope that Apple will not be stupid enough to make such acquisitions going forward. So that leaves two other ways to use the cash mountain that Apple continues to pile up and doesn't know what to do with: Right now, Apple pays a ~$10 annual dividend. With the stock at $450, that's about a 2.5% yield. Paying this dividend costs Apple about $10 billion of cash per year. Apple could easily afford to double this dividend to ~$20 per year. That would create a 5% yield, which is an excellent yield. It's also a much higher yield than almost every other stock in the market pays. And even this would only consume $20 billion a year. And Apple could also easily afford to spend another $20 billion a year buying back its own stock. At $450 a share, this would shrink the share base by about 5% per year. So Apple's earnings would be split up over fewer shares. If Apple keeps earning $40 billion a year, and it returns $40 billion a year to shareholders, its cash balance will stay at ~$135 billion, which, again, is vastly more cash than it needs. Apple could use $50-$100 billion of that cash to buy back stock, and that would shrink the share base even further. All of which is to say, Apple has multiple levers at its disposal to return cash to shareholders and boost earnings per share irrespective of the business. And the business itself looks cheap relative to its current earnings stream. Now, I am not suggesting that Apple's stock is suddenly going to rocket back to $700. For that to happen, Apple would have to release another product that is a quantum leap over the competition, and it would have to sell hundreds of millions of units of this product before its competitors caught up. (As has happened with the iPhone). I am also not suggesting that Apple's stock won't go lower from here. It may very well go lower from here. In fact, it may go lower and stay lower--forever. As I described a few days before Apple missed Q4 expectations and the stock crashed below $500, Apple could be in the beginning stages of the same sort of implosion that it experienced in the 1990s--the same sort of implosion that has claimed Research In Motion, Palm, Nokia, Yahoo, AOL, Cisco, and dozens of other tech giants over the years. The stocks of these companies are trading at mere fractions of the highs they hit back when they were "must-own" stocks, barring miracles, they will never trade at those highs again. Apple is certainly not immune from this fate. And anyone who still thinks it is is not facing up to the reality of the situation. But, Apple is also still a good company. And it has good products in fast-growing markets--smartphones and tablets. So if it can merely remain a good company, and keep pace with the competition (again, no guarantees), and if it begins to return even more of its vast cash mountain to shareholders, it should be able to maintain strong earnings per share, at least for a while. And if Apple can do that, the stock doesn't just look cheap. It is cheap. As a reminder, no one knows what is going to happen to Apple over the next few years, including the folks at Apple. So don't hallucinate that there's some guru somewhere who can tell you. All of these scenarios are possible, including the "train-wreck" one. Stock prices represent collective guesses about what will happen in the future, and no one knows for sure what the future holds. One final caveat... Most of the folks who bought Apple stock over the past 5 years bought it because they considered it a "growth" stock, not a "value" stock. The scenario I described above is very much a "value" stock scenario. If Apple's earnings do decline over the next couple of years, the "growth" investors who bought Apple's stock will jettison it, and the "value" investors will have to buy it. This process will take time. So even if Apple does end up delivering a compelling return over the next few years, this "turnaround" will likely take a while. SEE ALSO: How Low Could Apple Go?

Wikimedia CommonsThe basic concept of "currency wars" is that countries are all trying to weaken their currencies to boost exports. "Wars" is an overly dramatic word to use, but countries to complain about other countries engaging in currency weakening, and it does make for a good soundbite. Anyway, Citi's currency guru Steven Englander has an interesting note out about who inevitably "wins" these wars, and the answer is similar to that of real wars: the rich countries. As he puts it, they win because they're indifferent to the consequences. He lists several reasons why. We summarize. Anyway, some interesting food for thought as you think about the dynamics, and you think about who's doing the "currency wars" complaining. And though the phrase originally originated from Brazil (and seems to be popular in China as well) the latest round of complaining comes from Germany towards Japan, so it's not just a poor vs. rich thing.

Morgan Stanley analyst Gerard Minack is always an intriguing read: In his latest note he talks about output gaps and fiscal policy, and argues that fiscal policy has been particularly robust during this slump, in part because advanced economies have seen such a big gap between potential output and actual output. He writes: Economists have debated the short- and long-run efficacy of fiscal policy for decades. But it seems fair to say that fiscal policy has been more effective than many had expected through the current cycle. This may reflect the now widely appreciated difference between economic downturns that include financial crises versus ënormalí economic cycles. The downturns in ënormalí post-1945 economic cycles were often caused by policy errors (excess tightening). Few cycles in major economies, Japan aside, included systemic financial stress of the type seen over the past five years. Such cycle downturns typically did not affect trend growth. Consequently, the recovery saw catch-up growth running at a faster rate than in the period prior to the downturn. To that end, he produces a nifty chart looking at Japan, which is interesting its own stimulus cycle, and which has been in a state of poor output, post-crisis for the past 20 years. It basically shows why investors are so bullish: Expectations of stimulus. Morgan Stanley Of course, this leads to a question about the US, which is seeing creeping fiscal consolidation. How Japan-like is the US economy, and can markets really thrive if spending growth gets cut.
LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo American Plcwill take a $4 billion writedown on its Minas Rio iron ore operation in Brazil after delays and cost overruns forced the mining group to increase expenditure on the project. The company also said on Tuesday that it expects capital expenditure for the project to increase to $8.8 billion. "We are clearly disappointed that the diversity of challenges that our Minas Rio project has faced has contributed to a significant increase in capital expenditure," outgoing Chief Executive Cynthia Carroll said. "Despite the difficulties, we continue to be confident of the medium and long-term attractiveness and strategic positioning of Minas Rio and we remain committed to the project." Minas Rio, a leading iron ore project in Brazil, is Anglo's most significant failure of recent years and was largely responsible for Carroll's fall from grace. Anglo bought its first stake in Minas Rio in 2007, taking control in 2008 with a $5.5 billion deal with Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista's MMX - right at its peak. The project was intended to help to diversify a company that was still dependent on South Africa for the bulk of its revenue, but has instead been a bruising top-of-the-market deal. 'CONSTANT DISAPPOINTMENT' Anglo spent $4.8 billion buying Minas Rio - excluding the value of the Amapa mine, bought as part of the original deal but which Anglo has agreed to sell. It has spent $5 billion on developing it so far and said last year that total development costs could exceed $8 billion - more than three times original estimates. "This asset has been a constant disappointment in terms of project delivery and I think it was largely expected that we would get this sort of writedown," Nomura International analyst Sam Catalano said. "The challenge that remains for Anglo is to deliver it on the revised timeline and price that they've given us." The company said it is still targeting first ore on ship by the end of 2014 despite the challenges facing Minas Rio. Anglo's announcement comes after Rio Tintoousted its chief executive, Tom Albanese, on January 17 and took $14 billion in impairments tied to its underperforming Mozambican coal and Canadian aluminum operations. Other mining companies, such as BHP Billitonare also likely to write down underperforming assets as low prices and rising costs eat into valuations. Minas Rio is one of the biggest challenges facing Anglo's incoming chief executive Mark Cutifani, a former coal miner who will join the company from Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashantiin March. Development costs in Brazil have been driven higher by forthcoming major events such as the Olympics in 2016 and next year's soccer World Cup tournament, which have increased demand for labor. Shares in Anglo American were down 0.6 percent at 1862 pence at 0802 GMT, valuing the company at $41.2 billion. Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo American Platinum, the world's largest platinum producer, said on Tuesday that it had conducted "constructive" consultations with the South African government about a company restructuring that could lead to 14,000 job cuts.

The country-specific economic projections in the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects are clear about one thing: advanced economies won't be driving global growth.
