ArchivesBank run in New York in 1933. You can be forgiven for thinking that you don't need to give a hoot about what's going on in Cyprus this weekend. After all, it's just a little island somewhere in the Mediterranean. But what's going on in Cyprus could actually matter â€” not just to the rest of Europe, but to the rest of the world. Here's the short version of what's happening: Cyprus's banks, like many banks in Europe, are bankrupt. Cyprus went to the Eurozone to get a bailout, the same way Ireland, Greece, and other European countries have. The Eurozone powers-that-be gave Cyprus a bailout â€” but with a startling condition that has never before been imposed on any major banking system since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008. The Eurozone powers-that-be (mainly, Germany) insisted that the depositors in Cyprus's banks pay part of the tab. Not the bondholders. The depositors. The folks who had their money in the banks for safe-keeping. When Cyprus's banks reopen on Tuesday morning, every depositor will have some of his or her money seized. Accounts under 100,000 euros will have 6.75% of the funds seized. Accounts over 100,000 euros will have 9.9% seized. And then the Eurozone's emergency lending facility and the International Monetary Fund will inject 10 billion euros into the banks to allow them to keep operating. en.wikipedia.orgCyprus's government tried to explain this deal by observing that it was better than the alternative: Immediate bankruptcy and closure of the major banks. In that scenario, depositors would lose a lot more of their money. Businesses would go bankrupt. And tens of thousands of people would be instantly thrown out of work. But, still, not surprisingly, news that deposits in Cyprus's banks would be seized triggered an immediate run on the banks. Depositors rushed to ATMs and tried to withdraw their money before it could be seized. But the ATMs weren't working. And the government has now made it impossible to transfer money out of the country. So, assuming Cyprus's government approves the deal (still pending), depositors will have some of their money seized on Tuesday morning. Now, half of these depositors are said to be Russian oligarchs and other non-residents. And unless you happen to have the misfortune of having an account in a Cyprus bank, you may not care much whether these depositors have their money seized. After all, that was the risk they took for storing their money in bankrupt banks, right? Well, yes, that was the risk they took. But ever since the Great Depression wiped out a big percentage of the world's banks, vaporizing the bank depositors' savings in the process, banking system regulators have tried to do everything they can to protect bank depositors. And they are smart to do so. Because the moment depositors think that there is risk to their savings, they rush to banks to yank their money out. That's called a run on the bank. And since no bank anywhere has enough cash on hand to pay off all its depositors at once, runs on the bank cause banks to go bust. That's what happened to hundreds of banks in the Great Depression. And it's what happened to Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and other huge banks during the financial crisis (though, with Bear and Lehman, the folks who yanked their money out weren't mom and pop depositors but other big financial institutions). It's what threatened to bring the entire U.S. financial system to its knees. And it's why the U.S. and European governments have been frantically bailing out banks ever since. But now, thanks to Eurozone's bizarre decision in Cyprus, the illusion that depositors don't need to yank their money out of threatened banks because they'll be protected has been shattered. Depositors in Cyprus banks will lose some of their deposits. They will be furious about this. And they will, rightly, feel that it is grossly unfair â€” because depositors in the bailed-out banks in Ireland, Greece, etc. didn't lose their money. And they will feel like fools for not having taken their money out. And ... here's the important part ... Other depositors at weak banks all over Europe, in places like Spain, Italy, and Greece, will rightly wonder whether this is the beginning of a new era of bank bailouts, an era in which bank depositors are going lose some of their money. What do you think those other depositors in Spain, Italy, Greece, etc., are going to feel like doing when they realize that, if their banks ever need a bailout, they might have their deposits seized? That's right. They're going to feel like yanking their money out of their banks. And if some of them yank their money out of their banks, well â€” then the financial condition of those banks will go from weak to insolvent. And the banks will go rushing to their governments and the Eurozone for help. And if, god forbid, the Eurozone decides to seize the deposits of more bank depositors ... Well, then, a good portion of Europe is going to suddenly experience a good old-fashioned bank run. That, to put it mildly, could be a disaster. It could bring the European financial crisis, which has lurched from one flare-up to another for most of the past five years, to a rather sudden head. How much would it cost for the powers-that-be to bail out all of Europe's weak banks at once? A lot. More than the Eurozone has in its emergency lending facilities, certainly. And more than the International Monetary Fund has on hand. So the U.S. would probably have to get involved. And, regardless of whether the U.S. needed to get involved, the European economy would likely suffer the equivalent of a heart attack. That wouldn't be good for the U.S. economy. Or the Chinese economy. Or any other economy that sells things to Europe. So, you can see, this little decision to seize a little money from bank depositors in the little island of Cyprus could be a much bigger deal than you think. It could conceivably precipitate a run on weak European banks. And a run on weak European banks could hammer the European economy and then the economy of Europe's trading partners. And it could cause global markets to crash. So keep an eye on what's going on over there in Cyprus. It's potentially much more important than it seems.

It sounds like an e-mail scam, but this one is actually true. The Internal Revenue Service has hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed 2009 tax refunds, and you may be eligible for the money. You better act fast: This offer expires on April 15. The IRSÂ said ThursdayÂ that it may have refunds totaling around $917 million waiting for approximately 984,400 taxpayers who didn't file a federal tax return in 2009. The payoff could be substantial: The IRS said half of the potential refunds are worth more than $500. Some people don't file a tax return because they had too little income, even though some taxes were taken out of their paycheck. Under IRS rules, most taxpayers who don't file a return in a given year have three years to try to claim a refund. You don't have to pay a penalty for filing late if you qualify for a refund. For the 2009 returns, the three-year deadline will hit this April 15. After that, Uncle Sam gets to keep your money. There are some catches, though. Your refund check may be held if you didn't file a tax return in 2010 or 2011. The IRS also may use the money toward any unpaid state or federal taxes, or toward unpaid child support payments or federal student loan debts.
Wikimedia Commons In the early hours of Saturday, Cyprus agreed to a "bailout" with the EU and IMF that is veryÂ  controversial because it imposes an immediate one-time tax on everyone with money in a Cypriot bank before banks reopen on Tuesday (Monday is a holiday). The deal still needs to be passed by Parliament and that's not a sure thing. Ekathimerini has this report: The Cypriot government is now sweating over a possible rejection by the islandâ€™s parliament of the shocking set of measures imposed on Nicosia for the eurozone to bail its economy out of a likely default, announced in the early hours of Saturday. The Cypriot government is preparing the bill to be tabled in Parliament probably on Sunday in an emergency session, as everything will have to be voted by Monday night for Cypriot banks to open on Tuesday. The stakes are incredibly high. Here's a statement from Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades warning of total financial collapse and euro exit if there's no deal (via @dsquareddigest). Full statement from President Anastasiades below the dotted line --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is well known that the deep economic crisis and the state of emergency in which the country has found itself did not come about in the last fortnight since we have undertaken the administration of the country.The state of emergency and critical nature of the times do not allow me, as they do not allow anyone, to embark on a blame game.In the extraordinary meeting of the Eurogroup, we faced decisions that had already been taken and came across faits accomplis through which we were faced with the following dilemmas:On Tuesday, March 19 we would either choose the catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis, which would put a definitive end to the uncertainty and restart our economy.A possible choice of the catastrophic scenario option would have the following consequences:1. On Tuesday, March 19, immediately after the holiday weekend, one of the two banks in crisis would cease to operate, since the European Central Bank, following the decision already taken, would terminate the provision of liquidity. The second bank would suspend its work, and neither could avoid collapse. Such a phenomenon would instantly lead 8.000 families to unemployment.2. The State would be obliged to compensate depositors in response to the obligation regarding guaranteed deposits. The capital required in such a case would amount to about 30 billion euros, which the State would be unable to pay.3. A proportionate amount corresponding to the deposits of thousands of depositors for deposits over 100.000 Euro, would be led to a vicious cycle of asset liquidation, and these depositors would suffer losses of over 60%.4. Such an uncontrolled situation would push the whole banking system into collapse with all the attendant consequences.5. Thousands of small and medium enterprises, and other businesses would be driven to bankruptcy due to their inability to trade.As a result of the above, the service sector would be led to a complete collapse with a possible exit from the euro. That, in addition to the national weakening of Cyprus, would lead to devaluation of the currency by at least 40%.The second choice was the controlled management of the crisis, through the decisions taken and which can be summarized as follows:1. Ensuring the liquidity of the banks and the rescue of the banking system through their recapitalization.2. Rescuing 8.000 jobs in the banking sector and thousands of others which would be lost as a corollary of not maintaining the operations of banks.3. Total rescuing of deposits, with just the exchange of a small percentage of savings with shares of the two banks. Currently, these shares do not have their full value, but with the economic recovery they will repay most it not all of the amount that will be cut.4. This option results in a drastic reduction of public debt, makes it manageable and sustainable and relieves future generations from the burden of repayment.5. It saves provident and pension funds and avoids taking other tough measures such as wage and pension cuts that were put on the negotiations table.6. It avoids further recession and the risk of the vicious circle of a second memorandum.We are not aiming to gloss over the situation. The solution chosen may be painful, but it was the only one that would allow us to continue our lives without adventures. It's a decision that leads to the historic and permanent rescue our economy.In the next few hours we will all have to take responsibility. Tomorrow I will address the Cypriot people.
It was amusing to watch die-hard Apple zealots react to Samsung's product launch the other night. Now that Apple's excellent iPhone has been equaled and even surpassed by phones from other manufacturers, Apple fans have been reduced to muttering about subjective assessments like "taste" and "style" to defend the object of their devotion. Samsung's new phone hadn't even been launched yet, for example, before Apple fans started grumbling about it being made of "cheap plastic crap." It's certainly true that Samsung makes good use of plastic in many of its phones — a design choice that makes the phones lighter and, likely, more scratch and crack resistant. (I have not dropped iPhones and Galaxies side-by-side to test this — it's just a theory.) But Apple makes good use of plastic in many of its products, too, so it's not clear why Apple fans condemn others for using this material. I own a couple of small Apple iPods that are made of plastic, for example. And our office is still filled with white plastic MacBooks. When those products came out, I don't recall Apple fans grousing about how they were just "cheap plastic crap." Another thing that's odd about the Apple fan obsession with plastic is that most iPhones are used with a case. And these cases are generally made of materials that have a quite different look and feel from the material that the phones themselves are made out of. I, for example, have never dared carry my iPhone around without a plastic case. It's not that I don't like the look and feel of the naked iPhone — I do. It's that I drop the iPhone at least once a week, and it's a delicate instrument, so I don't want to risk smashing it. Although I know that some aficionados and daredevils love to keep their iPhones naked and tell stories of the phones surviving occasional drops, I'm just not willing to take that risk. A new phone would cost me $600, after all. And when I'm dealing with a tool that costs that much — especially a tool that I use for many hours every day — the importance of "form" runs a distant second to "function." In other words, as long as my iPhone works well, I'm not going to worry too much about the details of what it looks like. That's why, although I guess it's a plus that my iPhone is made of metal, I certainly don't think about that very often. Here's what my iPhone looks like: Jay Yarow/Business Insider This case, of course, mortifies Apple fanatics, who regard it as the very definition of "cheap plastic crap." But the many times that I've dropped my phone on concrete, I've been very glad to have it. (And, yes, it's true, this case is probably overkill. But I got it as a present! So using it makes me a lot happier than using a mass-produced naked iPhone would, no matter what it's made of.)
You probably thought the boom/bust cycle experiment that started with Alan Greenspan was over when Ben Bernanke came to the Fed.  Or maybe you weren’t that naive to begin with. Either way, Bernanke is implementing very similar and in my opinion, dangerous economic policy. When Greenspan was head of the Fed, he made it well known that the stock market was a favorite target of his.  This became known as the “Greenspan Put.”  This was the levitating effect of stock prices that placed a “put” or floor under the equity market. Greenspan was even more explicit a few weeks ago when he said: “the stock market is the key player in the game of economic growth.” I believe this is an incredibly misguided view of what the stock market is. The stock market is a secondary market where SAVERS exchange shares of stock in what is nothing more than an allocation of their savings. The price of those shares reflect the GUESSES of future expected cash flows.  And as we all know, what you have in stock market gains is not real until you cash out of the game and exchange your shares with someone else.  Of course, everyone can’t cash out of the game at the same time since all shares issued are always held by SOMEONE. So there’s an inevitable bag holder if the you-know-what hits the fan. There is no escaping that simple fact. The risk of course, is that a stock market has the inconvenient truth of both a “poverty effect” as well as a “wealth effect.”  Owners might feel better off if shares increase in value.  But owners feel just as poor when they decline.  Of course, if you can keep it going in one direction it’s like a good ponzi scheme.  But if the shares deviate from their underlying fundamentals and a disequilibrium occurs you’re asking for big time trouble from an inevitable “poverty effect.”  It ripples through the economy as stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down when panic sets in.  Anyone whose been awake during the last 15 years knows how that feels. The danger here is the illusion of real wealth where there is only nominal wealth.  And that illusion appears to have at least some impact on spending.  As you can see in the following chart (figure 1 via Orcam Financial Group), the personal savings rate is inversely correlated to stock prices.  So, the increased wealth makes savers feel better off temporarily and then when the air comes out of the market those savers suddenly realize that their stock portfolio is just an allocation of their savings and they stop spending as the poverty effect kicks in. There doesn’t appear to be any question that such a strategy can work in brief periods of time.  But the question is whether we should be designing policy around such an inherently fragile part of the economy (stock prices).  More importantly, we should ask ourselves whether a policy of targeting stock prices will create a disequilibrium where stock prices become detached from their fundamentals and create the illusion of a saver who is wealthier than he/she really is. Me, I prefer to let prices float as they will and implement policy that actually helps the underlying corporations.  If I were running a public company I wouldn’t waste my time talking up my stock price.  I would run the corporation to maximize earnings per share.  Global central banks obviously think this is nonsense.  And so the whole stock price targeting theory reeks of ponzi finance and putting the cart before the horse.  Of course, no one can know when the boom turns into the bust, but it appears as though this sort of policy substantially contributes to the bust when it does occur.   And that’s where we are.  We are in the boom phase. The bust will come (just as it always does) and when it does we’ll likely all turn to the same institution who helped the boom get out of control in the first place. Pragmatic Capitalism
Flickr / Walmart CorporateWhen anyone thinks low priced goods, they usually don't think "Made in the USA."  Cheap goods usually come from places like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. However, this perception is slowly changing as rising overseas labor costs and higher shipping costs are forcing U.S. companies to bring manufacturing back to the states.  This is being touted as the American manufacturing renaissance. In fact, this trend is so powerful that even Walmart, the leader in everyday low prices, believes "Made in the USA" is a smart and profitable strategy. Citi analyst Deborah Weinswig recently met with Walmart management.  Here's what she took away: Proudly Made in the U.S.A. — While global sourcing remains a significant source of EDLC opportunity, we believe that the $50B commitment to increase domestic sourcing over the next decade should benefit topline and profitability at WMT U.S. Domestic sourcing will help the company avoid wage inflation overseas and shipping costs, while increasing flexibility through shorter lead times and generating positive reputational buzz. WMT U.S. kicked off the initiative this week with Georgia state sourced towels, priced at $8.97 for bath size. They are offered in 600 stores and will be in an additional 600 stores by Sept., supported by local marketing. Weinswig enthusiastically reiterates her Buy-rating on the stock. She has an $82 price target.
The drama out of Cyprus Saturday continues to get more interesting. The country has been ailing for quite some time, and everybody knew that a bailout was coming. But the big surprise is that depositors in banks will be subject to an instant one-off tax to raise nearly 6 billion euros. The background is that because Cyprus has an enormous banking system -â€” and houses a lot of offshore Russian money â€” there was not much political appetite to bail it out, even though the amount of cash was minimal. In fact it seems, Germany was comfortable letting Cyprus go completely. Faisal Islam â€” who is the crack economics reporter at U.K. network C4 â€” tweets that Germany basically gave a quid-pro-quo. Take the deal, or leave the Eurozone. Faisal Islam
en.wikipedia.orgThe Economists's "Schumpeter" blog has a big takedown of the surprise bailout of Cyprus, which involves bank depositors being subject to an instant levy on all of their savings to raise money. Their title: The Cyprus Bail-out: Unfair, short-sighted and self-defeating. The post calls the bailout a "failure" for imposing a 10 percent deposit tax on those with over 100K euros in the bank and a 6.75 percent tax on those below that threshold. They cite three big reasons why this is a bad move. A lot of people will be wondering about the first point, the idea of contagion: Will depositors in another country worry about something similar happening? It's going to be discussed, but leaders from the EU and IMF made pains to say this is a one-off due to special circumstances. The special circumstances involve the large size of the banking system (relative to GDP) and the fact that Cyprus houses a lot of Russian offshore money, which the rest of Europe was not eager to bail out. This isn't the case in other countries. The last point about strategy is interesting. Things had been going pretty calmly in Europe for several months based on, let's face it, a big ECB free money backstop. Now we're getting back to loss-taking, which may be necessary at times, but certainly disrupts the flow.
Earlier this week we wrote about the great comeback of the U.S. dollar, a currency that everyone hated just a few months ago. The dollar bullishness is gathering steam. Via Sebastien Galy at SocGen, here's a chart of the latest data from the Commodities And Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which shows the positioning of speculators. You can see, dollar longs are surging and dollar shorts are shrinking. SocGen
AP There's a new government in Japan, and it appears determined to finally do "whatever it takes" to attempt to revive the moribund Japanese economy, which has struggled with deflation for a decade. The plan – called "Abenomics," named after newly-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – is three-fold. It involves a massive increase in fiscal stimulus through government spending, a massive increase in monetary stimulus through unconventional central bank policy, and a reform program aimed at making structural improvements to the Japanese economy. In short, "Abenomics" amounts to one of the biggest economics experiments the modern world has ever seen. Financial markets are loving it. The Japanese stock market is soaring. But what exactly is it, and how is it expected to work? In a recent report, titled "Abenomics Handbook," Nomura economists led by Tomo Kinoshita break down the Japanese government's new plan and examine the challenges facing it. Naturally, the first question is: How exactly are these policies supposed to boost the economy? While fiscal stimulus and structural reform are essential components of the experiment, monetary policy is expected to do most of the heavy lifting in the short term. So, let's take a look at the monetary policy behind the plan first. The goal of easy monetary policy is to reduce real interest rates. In Japan's case, it has a significant side effect of weakening the yen. So, the yen is weakening – and it's beginning its journey downward from incredibly elevated levels. (In recent years, investors piled into yen as a safe-haven currency, helping to drive up its value.) Business Insider / Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg A weaker yen could be virtuous for the Japanese economy. The currency has already devalued swiftly against the dollar since September, when the wheels of a new economic regime in Japan were set in motion. This does a number of things. Most importantly, it boosts exports, because other currencies can now buy more Japanese-manufactured products. That means manufacturers are selling more, which feeds into corporate earnings and hopefully translates to increased business investment. All of this should boost stock prices on a fundamental basis. At the same time, the weakening yen provides fuel for stocks. Since September, the Japanese government has verbally "talked down" the yen, and a big rally in the Nikkei materialized along with the decline of the currency. "As for the specific effect of higher share prices on the economy," the Nomura team writes, "we think higher share prices invigorate corporate capex by (1) making it easier for companies to raise funds, and (2) making companies more likely to invest in business expansion. We estimate that a 10 percent rise in share prices boosts capex by 3.2 percentage points one year later." And the wealth effect is a big part of the plan. Matthew Boesler / Business Insider, data from Bloomberg <U+008B>"For households, we think higher share prices stimulate willingness to spend by boosting the value of shareholdings and giving an indication of the health of the economy," the Nomura economists continue. "We estimate that a 10 percent rise in share prices boosts consumer spending by 0.12 percentage points three months later." All of this works to narrow the ¥16.5 trillion (~ $170 billion) gap between current GDP and potential GDP, thus working toward eliminating deflationary pressures. However, the Japanese government has come under fire in the international community recently for its verbal interventions in the yen that have caused it to swiftly devalue against other currencies. The Bank of Japan has a few other options. Recently, it announced that it would double its target inflation rate to 2 percent, employing open-ended asset purchases (much like the Federal Reserve is doing in the United States) to get there. This represents a shift from the conservatism that has characterized the Bank of Japan in recent years. Haruhiko Kuroda, a big dove on monetary policy (meaning he's usually in favor of more stimulus, not less), is set to take over at the helm of the central bank in April. The times are changing, and one can expect to see some experimentation in the months and years ahead. (Click here for 23 things the Bank of Japan could do to weaken the yen even more.) The second part of the "Abenomics" game plan involves short-term fiscal stimulus. This aims to revive economic growth immediately through increased government consumption and public works investment. Abe already introduced ¥5.3 trillion (~ $60 billion) in public works spending as part of its 2013 budget. That's up from an estimated ¥5 trillion (~ $50 billion) last year, according to Nomura, representing a change from the fiscal tightening that Japan has undergone in recent years. "<U+008B>Aside from the general account, the government plans to set aside spending for post-quake reconstruction efforts in special accounts," says Nomura. "The Abe government has decided to boost total spending on the five-year effort (through FY15) to about ¥25 trillion (~ $260 billion), from ¥19 trillion (~ $200 billion) previously." The important point here is that the government is pledging to be flexible with regard to fiscal policy in the coming years, a stance in stark contrast to those in the United States (which is dealing with the effects of sequestration) and the euro area (where economic austerity is helping to deepen the economic contraction there). Loose fiscal and monetary policy is supposed to facilitate expansionary economic conditions in the short term (although weakening the yen is arguably a longer-term goal as well). Crucially, though, the success of "Abenomics" hinges on the third prong of the approach: structural reform. The Nomura economists call this "the key to improving medium-term growth potential," details of which are expected to be unveiled to the public in June. "With government debt having expanded to more than 200 percent of GDP, we think it will be difficult for Japan to boost the economy in the medium term via fiscal spending alone," they write. "As the effects of bold monetary easing are primarily transmitted via expectations on the financial and capital markets, any resultant move out of deflation is likely to be short lived unless economic growth can also be boosted via the government's growth strategy." Below is a summary of the growth strategy currently under proposal. Nomura, based on Headquarters for Japan's Economic Revitalization data There are several aspects to the regulatory reforms under proposal as well, outlined below. Nomura, based on regulatory reform panel (within Cabinet Office) data In short, there is a lot of work to do. Will the Abe government be able to get it all done? There are some serious open questions about its ability to achieve success in putting the Japanese economy back on stronger footing. The first question is whether the Bank of Japan will be able to implement monetary policy to actually effect 2 percent inflation. After all, they've been operating with a 1 percent inflation target, and they haven't even been able to come close to that. The Nomura economists write, "While we think attainment of the 2 percent inflation target will be problematic, we see the establishment of the 2 percent inflation target as meaningful because setting the bar high and bringing on board more powerful easing measures makes an end to deflation more likely." Nomura also acknowledges the risks to financial stability that may arise from excessive monetary easing, warning that "if the BOJ were to sharply increase its purchases of financial assets, this could cause distortions in the markets for those financial assets, disrupting market mechanisms or producing unforeseen risks related to the accumulation of imbalances. In other words, there could be bubble trouble. The Abe government's fiscal approach is tricky, too. Good policy strives to be counter-cyclical, meaning that when the economy improves, the government should take the opportunity to tighten its belt. There's a consumption tax hike scheduled for 2014, though. Nomura thinks the Abe government will boost spending to offset it. NomuraClick to enlarge"The biggest challenge," the economists say, "is striking a balance with fiscal reconstruction." Abe's government says it wants to cut the budget deficit in half from 2010 levels by 2015 and flip the budget balance into outright surplus by 2020. Continued public spending could make that pretty difficult. Finally, if the yen stops weakening, it really puts the brakes on the entire "Abenomics" project. The yen is expected to continue its decline – and many expect the U.S. dollar to enter a new bull market – but, as ever, the future is uncertain, and for Japan, it depends on implementation. We should also note that this all assumes that the Abe government is committed to the task to begin with. There is at least one theory that ultimately calls this commitment into question. (Everybody Is Talking About The Japanese Yen's Collapse, But Nobody Understands The Prime Minister's True Motivations.) The Nomura economists come to the following conclusion: Yen depreciation benefits exporters but it could also have an adverse effect on the economy via an expansion of the trade deficit or a deterioration in the terms of trade (export prices/import prices). Also, the benefits of fiscal expansion and monetary easing are not limitless. In particular, fiscal and monetary easing are not limitless. In particular, fiscal expansion could stimulate market concerns regarding problems securing funding and fiscal risk. For Japan's economy to overcome these challenges and be revived, we think the key requirements are a change in ingrained expectations about deflation (ie, an improvement in growth expectations), a self-sustaining increase in private-sector economic activity (ie, growth without fiscal expansion), and fiscal reconstruction (ie easing of fiscal risk). If companies can pass higher import prices and other cost increases onto selling prices, we think restructuring pressures in Japan will lessen. If confidence in economic growth in Japan grows simultaneously with an improvement in Japan grows simultaneously with an improvement in corporate earnings, we think increases in employment and wages will be likely. If real wages increase amid efforts to end deflation and put inflation on track, we think the Japanese economy will be more likely to return to self-sustaining growth. The rest of the world will be watching closely. NomuraClick to enlarge
Bloomberg TVJefferies economist David Zervos has been bullish throughout this whole rally, arguing that Ben Bernanke has had everything under control, keeping markets steady, and providing proper stimulus to the economy. His latest note to clients is probably one of his most important yet, as it's addressed to the perma-bears that hate any notion of easy money, the Fed, or stimulus, and who argue that we're just in a sugar high period that will all come crashing down. You know who these people are that he's talking about, even though Zervos doesn't mention them by name: Rick Santelli, ZeroHedge, Jim Grant, etc. CNBC screengrabIn his note, Zervos writes: I actually feel a bit sorry for the bears. They have warned us for years about the dangers of central bank balance sheet expansion and monetary accommodation. And their "elite" have even banded together in the WSJ to sign protest petitions against QE. But the spoo keeps rising, jobs keep getting created and wealth keeps getting generated (at least for those who didn't follow the bears' ill-conceived advice). I feel sorry for them because they are simply living in the dark ages of monetary policy theory. They are stuck thinking like witch doctors rather than modern medical doctors. What does he mean, specifically? What he's saying is that these policy bears argue that we need a hard dose of Austrian-economics, Great Depression-style pain to clear out the "rot" from the system. And that after we've taken our lumps and inflicted pain on ourselves (sending unemployment to over 10 percent in the process), then we can start to form a true recovery that's not built on debt and low interest rates. But that's misguided. Zervos offers a great medical analogy: In order to illustrate the dichotomy between our current monetary doctors and the witch doctors, a metaphor will be useful. Imagine that you were in a car accident and you suffered head trauma. You had excruciatingly painful headaches and you had lost some ability to move your arms and legs. One set of doctors arrived on the scene with pain killers, anti-inflammatory drugs and rigid set of therapy to help you regain all your motor skills. The good news was that you were going to make a full recovery, the bad news was that when it came time to take you off the pain killers you might suffer some adverse addiction related  consequences from the meds. The doctors however assured you that when the time came they would help you through the "cold turkey" period and it would be just fine.  While you thought about the costs and benefits of this treatment, another set of doctors arrived. They did not believe in pharmaceutical treatments and warned of the long term side effects associated with having a big "internal balance sheet" full of these drugs. They showed you pictures of Germans with wheel barrels full of money trying to buy a loaf of bread in the 1920s as a deterrent to using the previous doctors' recommended remedy. Instead, they proposed a treatment that was used all the way back in the 15th century and was perfected by Dr. John Clarke in the 17th century. This treatment would involve enormous pain upfront, but it would ensure that you have none of those nasty side effects from the modern day pharmaceuticals. The treatment was called trephination and it involved drilling a hole in your skull to release the pain from the trauma. They said that if you would like to read more on trepanning take a look at the following web site. Here's what trepanning looks like: Wikimedia Commons The bottom line is: The Santellis and Jim Grants of the world think we need to solve our problems by drilling a hole in the side of our skull, and relieving all of the pressure that way. That's old style medicine. The new style is: Apply the painkillers that work, get through the kinks. And then yes, have some issues that come up when you're withdrawing from morphine, but at least they're issues that are far more easier than having a gigantic hole in your skull.

WHEN KEN ALEXANDER started working at the J&amp;L steel mill in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, in the 1970s, he was one of 17,000 workers. But the workforce quickly declined as the American steel industry withered in the face of cheaper foreign competition. In 1984 J&amp;L shut the mill. Four years ago another mill where Mr Alexander had found a job, across the Ohio river in Ambridge, also stopped work because of the recession. He was one of a skeleton staff of 20 kept on as watchmen. Derelict mills pepper the region, loose sidings flapping in the frigid Appalachian wind. The once celebrated steel industry around Pittsburgh (whose football team is called the Steelers) survived a series of crises over the years, notes Mr Alexander, but was further diminished by each of them--until now. These days the Ambridge mill, bought by a Russian conglomerate six years ago, is humming away. Its 400 workers transform solid steel bars produced at another mill nearby into seamless pipes, in demand by oil drillers, among others. The management is taking advantage of a seasonal lull in demand to straighten out kinks in the line and thus increase its capacity. Other firms are making much bigger bets on the local steel industry. Fifty miles to the north-west, in Youngstown, Ohio, a French firm, Vallourec, has spent $650m building an entirely new mill to make similar pipes. It began production in October, with a staff of 350. Thirty miles in the opposite direction, in Brackenridge, Pennsylvania, Allegheny Technologies is spending $1.1 billion on a new mill to produce stainless steel and other specialty metals. US Steel opened a new $100m mill in Ohio in 2011, also to supply the oil and gas industry. Timken, another steelmaker, is spending $200m on its mill in Canton, Ohio. The main reason for this flurry of investment lies a few thousand feet below the ground: the Marcellus shale, a geological formation containing huge reserves of natural gas trapped in tiny pores in the rock. It is thought to be America’s biggest gas field, stretching 600 miles along the Appalachians, from New York to West Virginia., but has only recently begun to be tapped, thanks to fracking and directional drilling. Last year the government of Pennsylvania alone issued permits for 2,484 such "unconventional" wells; 1,365 of them were actually drilled. Wells in the Pennsylvanian part of the Marcellus produced 895 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas in the first half of 2012, up from 435bcf in the same period in 2011 and almost nothing as recently as 2008. Driving through the south-western corner of the state, the benefits of this "shale gale" are easy to see. New roofs, fences, barns and tractors have sprouted on many local farms; plenty of shiny new pick-up trucks ply the roads. By one estimate, Pennsylvanians who allow drilling on their land earned some $1.2 billion in royalties last year. Suburban office parks are proliferating outside Pittsburgh, the biggest city in the area, with space being snapped up by oil firms, their suppliers and subcontractors, lawyers and environmental consultants. Even the most basic restaurants are overflowing at lunchtime, a local complains. All told, the Marcellus already supports over 100,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, according to an analysis by IHS, a research firm. That figure is expected to rise to over 220,000 in 2020. Shale gas gave the local economy a $14 billion boost last year, IHS reckons, and will buoy it by almost $27 billion in 2020. All the extra economic activity generated nearly $3 billion in taxes, it calculates. A new "fee" (the Republican word for tax) on gas production adopted by the state legislature last year should help raise yet more in future. Pennsylvania is just one of several states enjoying a shale-gas boom. Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas have all seen similar rushes. Shale-gas production in the United States as a whole rose more than fourfold between 2007 and 2010, says the Department of Energy. That has helped push up its gas output by 20% over the past five years, making the country the world’s biggest gas producer. BP, a big oil and gas firm, forecasts that North American shale-gas output, largely from the United States, will grow by an average of 5.3% a year until 2030. America is already producing so much shale gas that local gas prices have plummeted, from over $13 per million British thermal units (mmBTU) in 2008 to $1-2 last year. They have since recovered slightly (see chart 3, previous page), but America still enjoys remarkably cheap gas by international standards. In 2011 it had the second-lowest gas prices for industry among rich countries, after Canada, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). American factories paid a third of the German gas price and a quarter of the South Korean one, the agency reckons--and prices have fallen further since. Cheap gas is also translating into cheap electricity, since America’s marginal power supplies tend to come from gas-fired plants. In 2011, according to the IEA, American factories paid roughly half the going rate for electricity in Chile or Mexico and a quarter of the eye-watering Italian price. In New York last year prices were the lowest they have ever been since the state introduced a competitive wholesale market in 1999. Investors, naturally enough, are keen to take advantage of such bargain prices. They have been pouring money not only into steelmaking but all manner of energy-intensive industries, from plastics to fertilisers. Just up the Ohio from Ambridge, Shell is contemplating building a multi-billion-dollar "cracker" to turn the ethane that emerges with much of the gas from the Marcellus into ethylene, a feedstock for plastics. On the Gulf coast (another gas hub), Chevron Phillips, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Occidental Petroleum and Williams are all expanding existing chemical plants or building new ones. A chemical firm called Methanex is dismantling one of its factories in Chile and shipping it to Louisiana to take advantage of low gas prices. CF Industries is expanding its local fertiliser production. Nucor, a steel firm, is building a new mill. Sasol of South Africa hopes to build a refinery in Louisiana to turn gas into petrol. Several firms want to construct facilities in the region to liquefy gas and export it--a dramatic reversal from a few years ago, when the need was thought to be for import terminals. America’s big pipeline network creates a relatively liquid and fungible national market for gas, so customers far from any shale beds are still able to take advantage of low gas and chemicals prices. Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate, plans to build a $1.4 billion fertiliser factory in Iowa. Bridgestone, Continental and Michelin are all planning to make more tyres in South Carolina, reversing a long decline. Better still, the steep drop in the price of natural gas has driven America’s drillers to hunt for oil instead. Rigs are migrating from gassy places like the Haynesville Shale, in Louisiana, to spots where oil is trapped in tiny rock pores, such as the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, the Bakken formation of North Dakota and the Mississippian Lime, which sits astride the border between Oklahoma and Kansas. Applying the same techniques to such "tight oil" as to gas-laden shales, they have managed to increase America’s oil production by a third over the past four years, to 7m b/d. The government expects it to grow by more than 1m b/d over the next two years. The output of the Bakken Shale alone has risen from 100,000 b/d in 2008 to over 700,000 now. By the end of this year, BP predicts, America will overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s biggest producer of liquid fuel, meaning oil and biofuels. The newfound oil brings just as much of a bonanza to the places where it is extracted as the shale gas does. Flights to previously obscure airports in North Dakota--Dickinson, Minot and Williston--are full, as are all hotels within striking distance of the Bakken. Property prices have shot up. The oil industry now accounts for 15% of the local economy, according to IHS, and has brought 72,000 jobs to a state with fewer than 700,000 people. Despite its huge local impact, America’s shale-oil boom has pushed up global oil production by just a percentage point or two, not enough to reduce the price much. However, it has resulted in a big drop in America’s import bill. IHS calculates that unconventional oil reduced the trade deficit in 2012 by $70 billion, or about 10%. All told, says IHS, unconventional oil and gas accounted for $238 billion in economic activity, 1.7m jobs and $62 billion in taxes in 2012. That includes the exploration and extraction itself, the supply chains they rely on and the extra spending by all those newly employed oilmen. But it leaves out the second-order effects of cheaper gas, electricity and chemicals. Last year the American Chemistry Council, an industry group, forecast that over the next couple of years cheap gas would spur some $72 billion in new investments in eight gas-hungry industries alone. That, in turn, would lead to a further $342 billion in new economic activity in 2015-20, along with the creation of 1.2m new jobs. The different levels of government, for their part, would rake in an extra $26 billion a year in new taxes. In principle, all American companies and consumers benefit from lower energy prices. The effect may not always be big enough to spur heavy new investment, but it might be sufficient to keep American factories with high labour costs going in the face of foreign competition. Economists at Citigroup and UBS predict that the shale gale will lift America’s GDP growth by half a percentage point a year for the next few years. Indeed, cheap energy is cited as one factor by those who predict a manufacturing renaissance in America. Labour in China is getting more expensive, the argument runs, and so is shipping Chinese-made goods across the Pacific. At the same time ever shorter product cycles confer an advantage on factories located close to the people who consume their goods. Quality is easier to maintain and intellectual property easier to protect if the head office is not far away. Throw in lower bills for power or petrochemicals, and bringing work back home begins to look attractive. For the moment America’s manufacturing output remains below its 2007 level, and its trade deficit with China is still growing. But some high-profile examples have caught the headlines. GE has moved the production of some white goods from China and Mexico to Kentucky, and Lenovo, the Chinese firm that bought IBM’s personal-computer business, plans to return some manufacturing to North Carolina. In the long run, however, America will not be able to lure and retain investors like these without a better-educated workforce Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
The big news today is that to bailout Cyprus, the country will impose a 10 percent tax on people with over 100K EUR in Cypriot bank accounts. Those with less than 100K will pay less of a tax. Banks are closed until Tuesday (there's a holiday on Monday) but people are already lining up at ATMs, trying to take money out. APPeople queue to use an ATM machine outside of a Laiki Bank branch in Larnaca, Cyprus, Saturday, March 16, 2013. Many rushed to cooperative banks which are open Saturdays in Cyprus after learning that the terms of a bailout deal that the cash-strapped country hammered out with international lenders includes a one-time levy on bank deposits. The move, decided in an extraordinary meeting of the finance ministers of the 17-nation eurozone in the early hours Saturday, is a major departure from established policies. Analysts have warned that making depositors take a hit threatens to undermine investors' confidence in other weaker eurozone economies and might possibly lead to bank runs.

For years and years we've been tracking this chart: Initial jobless claims (red line) vs. the S&amp;P 500 (blue line). The purpose of the chart is just to indicate that, despite all of the griping about how this is a Fed-juiced market and so on, stocks reflect what's happening in the actual, real economy, as evidenced by the fact that for years, stocks have moved right in line with jobless claims. When jobless claims improve (we had to flip the line over, so that the line goes up upon improvement) stocks go up. During periods of economic weakness, stocks have gone down. This week, we hit fantastic levels in both. FRED
Jason Merritt/Getty ImagesWe noted with a bit of amusement on Friday that actress Mila Kunis said she was getting more into investing, and planning to hold less cash. In his latest Up &amp; Down Wall Street column, Barron's Randal Forsyth says signs are popping up all over the place. In addition to Kunis, Greenspan was also on TV yesterday: Now, with the Dow at a record, the Maestro declares stocks to be "undervalued," an assertion that might be open to reasonable debate. It does, however, reflect the increasingly ebullient sentiment becoming more pervasive not only among the financial elite, such as the former Fed chairman, but also celebrities far removed from the markets. And individual investors are getting exuberant too: Other signs of frothy sentiment also have been bubbling up, notably a jump in bullishness among investment advisory services polled by Investors Intelligence. Bulls increased sharply to 50.0% last week from 44.2%, while outright bears fell to 18.8% from 21.1%, their largest weekly drop in 10 months. Advisors looking for a correction also dwindled to 31.2% from 34.7%. Moreover, the spread between bulls and bears surged to 31.2% from 23.1% in just a week and put it in "the dangerous territory around 30%," Investors Intelligence commented. A wide spread a year ago preceded a market retreat, the service noted. Other signs that might make you kind of nervous, per the piece. Dow Transports are getting massively extended, and the number of NYSE new highs is actually dwindling, suggesting that the market gains are very concentrated. Read the full piece here &gt;
Flickr/Glen BowmanThe big news today is that the EU and the IMF have announced a bailout for Cyprus that involves a tax on all depositors. By the time the banks open on Tuesday, anyone with over 100K EUR in the bank will see their holdings clipped by 10 percent. Those with under 100K get a smaller tax. According to Reuters, there are already people lining up to try to get their money out. But on the Mediterranean island, initial incredulity at the decision gave way to anger. Co-op credit societies, normally open on Saturdays, were shut for business in the coastal town of Larnaca as depositors started queuing early in the morning to withdraw their cash. "I'm extremely angry. I worked years and years to get it together and now I am losing it on the say-so of the Dutch and the Germans," said British-Cypriot Andy Georgiou, 54, who returned to Cyprus in mid-2012 with his savings.

AP In the early hours of the morning in Europe, the Eurozone and the IMF announced a $10 billion bailout for Eurozone member Cyprus, whose economy is tied closely to Greece's, and who was in a similarly dire state. The details are here. A key angle here is the Russian angle. You may remember that along the way during the crisis, Cyprus has sought aid from Russia, which was unusual. Well the reason for that is that (Island of) Cyprus is a place where Russians are believed to do a lot of money laundering, which involves parking cash in Cypriot banks. What's stunning about Saturday's bailout is that depositors with over 100K euros in a Cypriot bank will see a 10 percent tax instantly before banks reopen on Tuesday. That will infuriate domestic savers, and it will mean that a lot of Russian oligarchs/mobsters/money launderers/etc. will take big hits. This is by design. As C4 economics editor Faisal Islam notes: Faisal Islam Sony Kapoor of the think tank ReDefine Europe has this grim take: Sony Kapoor The pseudonymous @pawelmorski has more in a brilliant post titled Cyprus: A Brutal Lesson in RealPolitik, which concludes that ultimately it's not that bad for Russians. It's basically a one-off 10 percent tax on the money-laundering business, and that actually there's also a smaller tax on account holders with less than 100K EUR, which means it's not just rich Russians taking the burden. And the Russians? The reason small depositors have been hit is that the losses inflicted would be much bigger if a) only large deposits b) only non-EU deposits were haircut. The data on Cyprus deposits is here (MUMs = Monetary Union Members). I would guess the thinking is that 10 percent is seen as a cost of doing business when it comes to money laundering, but 30 percent would probably finish Cypriot banking for good. If the infliction of losses on small depositors has a purpose, itâ€™s probably to reassure the Russians that they are not being discriminated against. Yes, I may have thrown up a little in my mouth typing that. * So: senior bondholders and Russians helped at the cost of smaller locals. Thereâ€™s more logic here than there appears at first glance â€” the primary aim of this programme is to hold the European banking sector together whilst having a vaguely realistic programme, not placing another huge bill on the core/Germany not ending the viability of Cyprus as an offshore banking sector. My own judgement is that inflicting costs on depositors in principle is an extremely important one, but that not sparing the small depositor is worse than a cruel piece of realpolitik â€” it is in fact a mistake.

Wikimedia CommonsEurozone leaders and the IMF on Saturday announced an unprecedented levy on all deposits in Cypriot banks as the sting in the tail of a 10-billion-euro bailout for the near-bankrupt government in Nicosia. Intended to apply to everyone from pensioners to Russian oligarchs alleged to have billions stashed away in what officials say is a bloated Cypriot banking sector, the "stability levy" immediately raised a flood of concerns among finance experts over a possible bank run in bigger eurozone economies, where fragile public finances are also under scrutiny. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, after chairing some 10 hours of talks to strike the deal with counterparts including International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde and the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi, said the "upfront, one-off" tax is expected to raise 5.8 billion euros on top of the loans still to be finalised by eurozone parliaments. The levy will see deposits of more than 100,000 euros in Cypriot banks hit with a 9.9 percent charge when lenders re-open their doors on Tuesday after a scheduled bank holiday on Monday. Under that threshold and the levy drops to 6.75 percent. Top ECB official Joerg Assmussen said the only way to drive down what was originally requested as a 17-billion-euro rescue was to claw back money from the Cypriot banking sector, which is estimated to hold assets worth five times the country's economic output. "In order to have burden-sharing, you extend the tax base," Asmussen said. "To residents and also to non-residents." Lagarde said she would recommend that the IMF board now agree to chip in what one diplomat said could amount to another billion euros ($1.3 billion) in loans. Lagarde said "the exact amount is not yet specified and will take a little bit of time" to arrive at. Officials including the EU's economy and euro commissioner Olli Rehn also cited "positive" parallel talks with Russia on possibly easier terms on a 2.5-billion-euros loan it gave to the Cypriot government. Cyprus Finance Minister Michalis Sarris will reportedly fly to Moscow for talks Monday about extending that loan, due to be repaid in 2016. Under the deal, the Cyprus government will also have to hike corporate tax to 12.5 percent from 10 percent and sell off state assets so as to help balance the public finances. "As it is a contribution to the financial stability of Cyprus, it seems 'just' to ask a contribution of all deposit-holders" to the rescue, Dijsselbloem said. "The challenges we were facing in Cyprus were of an exceptional nature," the Dutchman said, under tough questioning from journalists at a press conference after the meeting in Brussels. "We did what we had to," said French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici on exiting the talks. "It's something that compared to other possible outcomes, is the least onerous," said finance minister Sarris, This arrangement notably meant his government "avoided salary and pension cuts" for public sector workers, he said. Cyprus accounts for just 0.2 percent of the combined eurozone economy but officials said it had to be bailed out to safeguard the principle that no eurozone state could be allowed to default and so compromise the credibility and integrity of the single currency. A "withholding tax" will also be imposed at source on interest earned in Cypriot banks in a further hit . The talks had dragged on as the Cypriot government fought its ultimately doomed battle to avoid a "bail-in" or haircut, which it argued would trigger a run on its banks and ricochet on through the wider eurozone financial system. Cyprus President Nikos Anastasiades attended the talks. The Cyprus price tag is very small compared with two rescues for Greece worth some 380 billion euros ($496 billion), Ireland's 85 billion euros, Portugal's 78 billion and 41 billion for Spanish banks. Russians are among the biggest investors in Cyprus, and hardline lenders like Germany had pressed for months for a clampdown on banks' alleged involvement in money laundering. The total annual output of the Cypriot economy is 17 billion euros, and the IMF was concerned that a bailout on that level would take the country's debt burden to unsustainable levels.
