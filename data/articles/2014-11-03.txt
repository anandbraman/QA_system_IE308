Thomson ReutersVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (L) greets supporters during a meeting outside CaracasCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on Monday a 15 percent increase in the minimum wage starting in December to protect workers from inflation of more than 60 percent. Maduro blames soaring consumer prices on an "economic war" launched by foes of his socialist government, frequently accusing business executives of price-gouging, hoarding and speculating. Critics, though, say Venezuela's endemic inflation problem is evidence of the failure of 15 years of socialist economics under Maduro and his late predecessor Hugo Chavez. "I have decided to accept this proposal, from the workers, to decree a 15 percent rise in the minimum salary from Dec. 1," Maduro said during a televised event with workers. Maduro said the cumulative raise for 2014 - following a 30 percent hike in May and 10 percent in January - would compensate for inflation caused by the "criminal" campaign against him. The wage hike planned for December would put Venezuela's minimum salary at 4,889 bolivars. That is equivalent to $776 at the lowest official currency rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar, but just $49 at a black market rate quoted on illegal web sites. In the last data available, Venezuela's annualized inflation rate reached 63.4 percent in August, with consumer prices rising by 3.9 percent that month, according to the Central Bank. Oil-dependent Venezuela's inflation malaise is a decades-old problem, also surpassing 60 percent in the 1990s before Chavez, according to IMF data.

Former star Yale University quarterback Patrick Witt has come out against Harvard University's new sexual assault policy in a Boston Globe op-ed, writing that his life was "nearly ruined" by a similar policy at Yale. Witt gained national attention his senior year when he was faced with the choice of keeping an interview with the Rhodes Scholarship Trust or play in "The Game," the last football game of the season against rival Harvard University — both were scheduled on the same day. When Witt chose to play, there was some controversy as to whether his Rhodes Scholarship interview was revoked following an informal sexual assault complaint against him. In his Globe op-ed, Witt emphasizes that the complaint was informal and that he was told that "the informal complaint did not constitute a disciplinary proceeding and nothing would be attached to my official record at Yale." However, Witt writes, the complaint — which was anonymously leaked to the Rhodes Trust, his future employer, and The New York Times — "cost me my reputation and credibility, the opportunity to become a Rhodes scholar, the full-time job offer I had worked so hard to attain, and the opportunity to achieve my childhood dream of playing in the NFL." Below, Witt expands on the negative impact of Harvard's and Yale's sexual assault policies: The destructive power that Yale's and now Harvard's new sexual misconduct policies wield is immense and grossly underestimated. By giving to unsubstantiated accusations the confoundingly difficult-to-define title of "informal complaint" — and denying accused students an opportunity to clear their names — these policies place the entire weight of the university’s reputation on the side of the accuser and against the accused. After all, if you didn't do anything wrong, then why has your school recognized a complaint against you, informal or otherwise? I cannot begin to describe how exasperatingly difficult it has been to try to explain to people what an informal complaint is and how there was never any evidence — nor any effort made to discover evidence — to substantiate the claim made by my accuser. My summer employer and the NFL certainly couldn’t understand it, and the media flat out didn't care — the words "informal complaint" were all that was needed to establish my guilt in their eyes. The former Yale undergraduate is now a first-year student at Harvard Law School, where 28 professors recently wrote a Globe op-ed blasting the same sexual assault policy to which Witt objects, which implements a "preponderance of evidence" standard for sexual assault investigations and creates a centralized university office of trained investigators to handle any complaints.  The Harvard professors wrote that "As teachers responsible for educating our students about due process of law, the substantive law governing discrimination and violence, appropriate administrative decision-making, and the rule of law generally, we find the new sexual harassment policy inconsistent with many of the most basic principles we teach." Notably, Witt vehemently denied that the informal sexual assault complaint had any effect on his decision to choose The Game over his Rhodes interview. A New York Times article explicity made the link between the complaint and Witt's alleged loss of an interview with the Rhodes Trust. FREE AppDownload
Billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's aides appear to have really embraced the new ".nyc" domain name, launched last October. amNewYork reported Monday that the law firm representing Bloomberg's foundation recently purchased at least 400 .nyc domain names related to his name. Though some are more or less normal web addresses — "bloombergfamilyfoundation.nyc" and "officialmikebloomberg.nyc," for example — others border on the absurd, including "MikeBloombergIsADweeb.nyc." Reached for comment, Bloomberg's spokeswoman said she was unaware about the domain name spree until earlier today. She added Bloomberg would be getting rid of the sillier domain names. "It's news to us. This appears to be overly-aggressive legal due diligence, and we're only keeping the straightforward addresses," she said in a statement. According to Domain Name Wire, some of the more ridiculous registrations include: BloombergBlows.nyc MikeIsTooShort.nyc MikeBloombergisaDweeb.nyc MikeBloombergRocks.nyc  MikeBloombergblows.nyc MichaelBloombergisaWeiner.nyc F---kbloomberg.nyc BloombergistooRich.nyc getalifemike.nyc BloombergisanAss.nyc Records show the law firm, Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, registered the listed addresses in October.

The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal probe on JPMorgan Chase's foreign exchange trading. The bank gave notice of this investigation in a government filing released Monday. Here's what it says: DOJ is conducting acriminal investigation, and various regulatory and civil enforcement authorities, including US banking regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) and other foreign government authorities, are conducting civil investigations, regarding the Firm’s foreign exchange ("FX") trading business. These investigations are focused on the Firm's spot FX trading activities as well as controls applicable to those activities. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations and is currently engaged in discussions with DOJ, and various regulatory and civil enforcement authorities, about resolving their respective investigations with respect to the Firm. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in settlements. Since November 2013, a number of class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against a number of foreign exchange dealers, including the Firm, foralleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates reported on the WM/Reuters service. In March 2014,plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action. Elsewhere in the filing the bank disclosed that over the past few months there had been a heightened willingness among regulators to bring criminal charges against banks in general. It said that these investigations had "significant collateral consequences" to banks, including losing customers or getting banned from being able to sell certain products. They're not great for stock prices either. JPMorgan also disclosed that its estimated losses resulting from legal proceedings could total between $0 and $5.9 billion as of last Sept. 20. However, in certain cases the firm acknowledges that it can't estimate how much it could lose. FREE AppDownload
Republicans plan to adopt a combative but strategic approach toward governing in the increasingly likely event they take control of both chambers of US Congress, top GOP lawmakers and aides told Business Insider.  With an eye toward the 2016 presidential election, Republican leaders in the House and Senate will look to move forward GOP legislative priorities popular with the American public and could earn an ample number of Democratic votes to send to President Barack Obama's desk. They'll also aim to show they are the party best able to run the country. "We want to demonstrate a kind of competence that Harry Reid has not," a senior Republican Senate aide told Business Insider recently, referring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "They have governed with the sole purpose of casting the Republican Party in a bad light," the aide said of the Democrats. "We want to pass legislation that casts the party in a more favorable light." Some of the immediate legislative priorities that Republicans would look to act on include passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline — which the Obama administration has delayed multiple times over the past three years — chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, and corporate tax reform. The goal is to force Obama to make decisions on popular bills, putting him in a corner where he will have to either veto legislation or begrudgingly accept it. Obama has vetoed only two bills during his first six years in office, the fewest since President James Garfield's brief, one-year tenure. "We want to get things in front of the president that define him and his party," the Senate aide said. "Harry Reid has protected him. We want to force him to make a choice." Republicans look increasingly likely to take control of the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections. The GOP is also likely to expand on its 34-seat majority in the House, with analysts expecting a two- to 10-seat pickup. Analysts consider the finance and energy sectors to potentially see a major boom from a GOP takeover of the Senate. APHarry Reid and Mitch McConnell might be trading places. But how quickly Republicans can put their plan into action under likely Majority Leader Mitch McConnell depends on whether they cleanly win the Senate on Tuesday, or whether the fight will extend into December — or even into January. That's a possibility if elections in Louisiana and Georgia extend to runoffs and Senate control is dependent on their outcomes.  The uncertainty surrounding the runoffs could have a "halting effect" on the start of Congress' lame-duck session this month, said Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. But there will need to be a sprint on certain must-pass legislation, like the continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down. Here's a look at how different areas could be shaped by GOP control of the Senate: The Republican Holy Grail — a bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act — will see its best chance for passage next year. But while there will likely be a full vote in the Senate to repeal the entire healthcare law, aides said, the overall GOP strategy will likely be to chip away at parts of the law in bills that could make it to the president's desk. A full-repeal bill would certainly prompt a presidential veto. One item Republican House and Senate aides think is likely to make it to Obama's desk — and potentially get his signature — is a bill to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices. A similar amendment, championed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who is in line to become the next chair of the Senate Finance Committee, passed by a 79-20 vote in 2013. "I think the med-device tax and some other little areas would be the best place to start, because that is the 'possible,'" a senior GOP aide on the Finance Committee told Business Insider of Republicans' pursuit of Obamacare-related legislation in the next session of Congress. Republicans could also take aim at so-called risk corridors in the health law, a potential fight that some Republican senators have already begun discussing as part of a potential shutdown fight. The "risk corridors" in question aim to make it easier for insurance companies to transition to the new healthcare system, largely by making it less financially risky for them to sell new insurance plans on the government exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. But Republicans have charged the program amounts to a "bailout" for insurance companies, and a bill targeting the provision is something they think could attract Democratic votes. "Why not just do it separately?" one Republican aide said when asked about the possibility of tying funding for the risk-corridor program to the continuing resolution, which keeps the government funded and needs to be passed by Dec. 11 to prevent a shutdown. If Republicans tackled the issue of risk corridors in a separate bill, it would simplify messaging and make some Democrats more likely to jump on board. In general, Senate Republicans will look to follow the House GOP Obamacare playbook of the past four years. They plan to use their subpoena powers to full effect and hold more oversight hearings on the healthcare law. Some of the issues those potential hearings will focus on include money Republicans claim has been wasted on state insurance exchanges that ended up converting to the federal marketplace, the security of HealthCare.gov and state-exchange websites, and the process for verifying people's incomes to receive subsidies for health insurance. "Being in the minority, we don't have the ability to call a hearing and to get the witnesses that we'd want," the GOP Finance Committee aide said. But should the GOP take the Senate, he added, "I think oversight of Obamacare would be something you'd see a lot more of." REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueObama is facing potential historic losses in his sixth year. One of the GOP's first orders of business, should it win the Senate, may well be mounting a united front to oppose any Obama administration-led deal on Iran's nuclear program. Such a move could win the backing of a decent amount of Democrats. Such a move could well become the first of many intense fights set for a lame-duck session of Congress. "Where to start?" said Greg Valliere, the chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group. "After the immigration executive order comes a bitter fight on Iranian sanctions, then a battle over whether to pass a continuing spending resolution or an omnibus, then a fight over tax extenders — and that's just in the lame duck." The Obama administration has signaled it might attempt to maneuver around Congress and avoid allowing a vote on any final agreement with Iran, the deadline of which is set for Nov. 24. But unity among top Republicans and Democrats, including Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) and Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey), would make that more difficult. "By threatening to cut out Congress from the Iran nuclear deal, the administration is actually uniting Congress," Kirk said in a recent statement. "We will not support an Obama-Khamenei deal that condemns our children to a future where the Middle East is full of nuclear weapons," he added, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee) appears next in line to take over from Menendez as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee if Republicans take control of the Senate. Corker has also stressed that any final deal must be approved by Congress. He said on the Senate floor this summer that if Obama did not submit a final approval to Congress by four days after the Nov. 24 deadline, all sanctions relieved under the interim agreement should be restored.APCould Obama find some areas to work with Republicans? But a GOP Senate could also help jump-start a key part of Obama's foreign-policy agenda, where he has run into a roadblock from his own party. The big obstacle to Obama's ambitious trade agenda has so far been Harry Reid. Obama needs Congress to pass a special authority for him to fast-track certain trade deals that Congress can either accept or reject, but cannot change. Reid has not allowed a vote on fast-track legislation, and Democrats generally fear expanded trade could cost American jobs and have a negative effect on global wages. But Obama has long advocated a pair of trade agreements with the EU and nations in Asia, saying they will create millions of jobs through a vast expansion of US exports. Republican aides told Business Insider they are open to working with Obama to get fast-track legislation. "Trade is an issue that Democrats see as tough medicine," the GOP Finance Committee aide said. "They know we need it. They know it's good in the long run. It's just hard to swallow. "We feel strongly that if you're another nation who's negotiating with the US, the likelihood of trying to close a deal you can't guarantee is going to get an up-or-down vote in the Senate — there's not a lot of incentive there to close a deal. I think the administration knows they need TPA [Trade Promotion Authority], and it's an issue that splits Democrats much more than it splits Republicans." T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty ImagesSen. Jeff Sessions. A coming Republican Senate would also make Obama more likely to take executive action quickly on immigration, something he delayed until after the elections. The only question at this point is when, not if. Many analysts expect Obama to announce his executive action before Thanksgiving. But the timing will likely depend on whether Republicans secure control of the Senate on Tuesday — Obama wouldn't want to imperil Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in a theoretical runoff in Louisiana. Obama's actions will likely face heavy pushback from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the likely next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), who will likely take over as chair of the Senate Budget Committee in a GOP Senate.  "The President is assuming for himself the sole and absolute power to decide who can enter, work, live, and claim benefits in the United States. He has exempted virtually every group in the world from America immigration laws," Sessions said in a statement last week. Any executive action would effectively poison the well for any legislative fix to the nation's immigration system until after Obama leaves office. The legislation passed by the Senate in 2013 expires with the end of this Congress in early January. Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said this weekend that a Republican House and Senate would pass immigration legislation. But Republican strategists speculated that any legislation Republicans would try to pass would be more about messaging on a "secure border" than a comprehensive revamping of the nation's immigration laws. Then there's the ever-ambiguous issue of tax reform, which has been floating around Washington for virtually all of Obama's term. It will figure even more prominently next year as it will be a priority for Republicans who think a revamp of the corporate tax code is essential to boosting economic growth.  Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), considered likely to be the next chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has put tax reform high on his list of issues to tackle. At a recent campaign stop with Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) in Overland Park, Kansas, Ryan told Business Insider he and Hatch, the likely next chair of the Finance Committee, would work to come up with a proposal by sometime next year. "We have to reform this tax code," Ryan said. "Because we're taxing American businesses at much higher rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs." Roberts, who will be a senior member on the Senate Finance Committee, said the House and Senate committees would work as "hard as possible to get it done." "We know it has to be done. It's long overdue," Roberts said. "You elect a Republican majority in the United States Senate, and I can assure you that under Orrin Hatch's leadership, and Paul's leadership, that we will have a proposal for serious tax reform." But privately, both the administration and Republicans are skeptical the other side would work in good faith on tax reform. Republicans felt jilted by the Obama administration's focus on so-called tax "inversions" this year, which culminated in unilateral action by the Treasury Department to curb the practice earlier this fall.  Republicans agree that the issue of inversions needs to be addressed, but they prefer that it be done as part of broad tax reform. They believe administration focused on the practice for political gain — though it never ended up fully resonating as an issue with the American public. Senior Republicans believe there is a risk the administration would do the same thing with broad tax reform, citing a lack of communication from the White House to top GOP lawmakers on the issue thus far. "There's not a lot of outreach going on about this," one senior Republican Senate aide told Business Insider. "You can already see: They're messaging." A significant part of Obama's legacy rests on the judicial nominees he can appoint to courts, which will determine the constitutionality of his administration's policies, regulations, and executive actions long after he leaves office.  With Reid's help, judicial appointments have been one of the few ways Obama has been able to work around Congress. Last year as majority leader, Reid changed Senate rules so that executive and judicial appointees could pass the Senate by a majority vote, taking away most of Republicans' power to filibuster these nominees.  If they control the Senate, that advantage will disappear. Grassley, the likely next chair of the Judiciary Committee, could block any nominees from even receiving a hearing. And McConnell could prevent them from getting a full vote on the Senate floor. Three of Obama's nominees to the powerful US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit were confirmed last year after Reid changed the Senate's rules. Thanks in large part to Obama's appointments, Democratic-appointed judges now hold a majority on nine of the country's 13 appeals courts. When he started his term, Democrats had a majority on only one of the courts. Many of Obama's appointees are controlling his agenda, writing new rules for financial reform, climate change, and even gun control and immigration. The rules change has the potential to end up being the most important part of Obama's legacy outside of Obamacare. The D.C. Circuit Court, outside of the Supreme Court, is generally considered the second most powerful court in the nation, with its vast jurisdiction over the federal government and thousands of regulations, rules, and executive actions from more than 400 administrative agencies. It's the court, for example, that in January ruled Obama's 2011 recess appointments unconstitutional.   "The issues before this court are some of the most important with respect to administrative law, which is where so much law gets made today," Roger Pilon, the chair of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, told Business Insider. "When you can't get things through Congress in the normal, constitutional way, what you do is exactly what Obama's doing," he said. "You turn to ruling by executive order." One of the key tenets of Obama's second-term agenda, for example, is in the area of climate change, on which he has no chance of working with Congress. He has admitted this, and so the Environmental Protection Agency has been writing new rules on climate policy, including new carbon emissions standards for existing power plants. Any challenges to Obama's new policies could end up in the D.C. Circuit Court. With a Democratic majority now sitting on the court, those challenges are more likely to be dismissed. A full D.C. Circuit Court panel also agreed to rehear a significant case related to Obamacare after a setback to the law by a smaller, Republican-skewed panel on the court. But a Republican majority would put a significant dent in Obama's ability to reshape the federal judiciary. According to data from the group Alliance for Justice, there are 56 total district and circuit court vacancies without nominees. Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute wrote this March that he expects Republicans to confirm virtually none of the possible nominees if they take control.

It's still really hard to get a mortgage in America without a perfect credit score. That's the takeaway from has a new economic letter put out by John Krainer and Erin McCarthy at the San Francisco Fed. The authors think that mortgage lending standards are still too tight for those without great credit scores, and that might be holding back the housing recovery. "We find that while banks appear more willing to lend, as indicated by an increase in the bank share of overall mortgage lending, credit conditions do not seem to be easing for borrowers with lower credit scores." From a survey of lenders, the authors find that after the recession, lending to borrowers with good credit picked up pretty rapidly, but lending at the lower end of the market is still stalled. On the one hand, this is bad for the housing market, and probably holding back a little bit of economic growth. On the other hand, extreme easing of credit standards on subprime mortgages is what got us into this mess in the first place. The authors do see a slight uptick in the number of private loans (not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac), but say they think this is mostly coming from the jumbo mortgage market — that is, mortgages for expensive houses (above $417,000 in most markets, but the limit is $625,501 to $721,050 in designated high-priced housing markets). This is a good thing, but only if you can afford one of those mortgages. From the post: A particularly important point is that bank-funded jumbo or nonconforming loans do not have any substitute readily available elsewhere in the mortgage market. To the extent that this type of lending is making up an increasing share of new mortgage lending, there appears to be some evidence that constraints on credit access are easing somewhat at this end of the market. In addition to an increasing share, the interest rate spread for jumbo mortgages began to narrow towards the end of 2013. The drop in rates coinciding with the increase in the jumbo share suggests that the supply curve of the banks has shifted in favor of holding these loans. As for everyone else, well, good luck raising your credit score: San Francisco Fed FREE AppDownload
JP Morgan Asset ManagementFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisers.  The Midterm Election Results Probably Won't Affect Government Consumption (JP Morgan Asset Management) The upcoming midterm elections have, unsurprisingly, raised concerns over the Congress' budget priorities.  However, it's important to note that government consumption "is one of the least variable components of the GDP," according to JP Morgan. "Year to year, the government spends a consistent amount; while this consistency is largely due to defense spending, public works projects also help keep spending steady." As a result, JP Morgan analysts believe that major change in government consumption is "unlikely," regardless of which party takes control of Congress following elections. Here Are The 3 Biggest Myths About Retirement-Income Strategies (Charles Schwab) There are three major myths about retirement-income strategies. First, many investors believe that yield is the most important factor in portfolio building. But this strategy is can cost you the benefits of diversification and capital appreciation, writes Rob Williams. Second, investors believe bonds are inherently better than bond funds. "Depending on your portfolio size and preferences, bond funds can fill most of the needs often served by individual bonds. If you don't have the interest, time or resources to build a diversified portfolio, a collection of bond funds can do the job as well," writes Williams. And finally, investors believe that annuities are "bad" and expensive. However, some annuities provide insurance against several risks while other investments can't. Young Advisers Will Learn Only By Doing (Financial Planning) Experience is the greatest teacher, and senior advisers should encourage their new hires to be extremely hands-on, as opposed to watching from the sidelines, to learn the ropes. There are several ways to get young advisers involved. First, senior advisers should have them write meeting summaries and correspondences with clients. Next, they should set target milestones for handling specific scenarios. And finally, senior members should give presentation feedback, so that younger hires know where to fix mistakes. Resist The Urge To Lecture Clients (Advisor Perspectives)  Connecting with clients emotionally is the most important aspect of the adviser-client relationship, writes Dan Solin. And there are two important ways to do this during meetings: no lecturing and no taking notes. Lecturing inhibits emotional connection because oftentimes a client's concerns differ from what advisers believe is important. As a result, clients may feel rejected. Instead, advisers should find out personal information about the clients, and answer their questions first. Additionally, advisers should avoid taking notes during client meetings — especially during the first meeting.  If you're looking down at a piece of paper, you're going to have a hard time making an emotional connection with your prospective client. And besides, no one makes serious financial decisions during a discovery meeting. Muni Investors Should Remain At The Longer End Of The Curve (BlackRock Blog) Municipal bonds are typically a buy-and-hold option for most investors. As a result, it's important to look at the long-term trend in interest rates — not just the next few months. The Fed generally uses inflation and employment to gauge the interest-rate policy. If these two movements "remain muted," then central bankers should not be too aggressive in the rate movements in the future. "For muni investors, that means the longer end of the curves should remain the place to be for incremental yield pick-up for the foreseeable future. Although longer maturities have gotten expensive recently ... they should continue to represent long-term value for traditional muni bond investors," writes Peter Hayes. FREE AppDownload
InstagramThe controversial multilevel marketing health company Herbalife reported its third-quarter earnings on Monday afternoon. Earnings per share came in at $1.45. Analysts polled by Factset expected earnings per share to come in at $1.51, up from $1.41 at the same time last year. So that's a miss, and now the stock is getting punished. It's now down 12% in after-hours trading. Perhaps the worst part of the earnings release was that the company's guidance also fell remarkably short of The Street's expectations. Analysts expected 2015 guidance to indicate 7% revenue growth, but the company announced that it expected -1% to -2% revenue growth. And here's the chart, via MarketWatch: MarketWatch On Friday the company agreed to pay a $15 million fine to settle a class-action suit brought by a former employee who said the company was a pyramid scheme. That accusation has plagued the company since December 2012, when hedge fund manager Bill Ackman gave a 300-slide presentation making the same claim. He then announced that he was shorting the stock to zero. The resolution of the class-action suit suggests that the government may be done looking into Herbalife — definitely not good news for Ackman's trade. It is, however, good news for Carl Icahn, the investor who very publicly lambasted Ackman for his position. They have since made "friends." Check out the full earnings release below: Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) today reported third quarter net sales of $1.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 4 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Adjusted1 net income for the quarter was $125.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to $152.1 million, or $1.41 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. On a reported basis, the company announced third quarter net income of $11.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $142.0 million, or $1.32 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. Third quarter 2014 reported net income was negatively impacted by $139.5 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.97 per diluted share after tax, related to the remeasurement of Venezuelan Bolivar denominated assets and liabilities at the SICAD I and SICAD II rates, and $17.5 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.13 per diluted share after tax related to a legal reserve. For the quarter that ended September 30, 2014, the company generated $101.9 million net operating cash flow, and purchases of property, plant and equipment in the period were $34.5 million. Michael Johnson, chairman and CEO stated, “In the quarter we saw volume increases in two-thirds of our 91 countries, especially Russia and China. Excluding the impact of currency translation in Venezuela, the company had solid increases in both volume and net sales. We continue to implement initiatives that we believe will further strengthen our foundation and drive long-term improvements in activity, productivity and retention of our Sales Leaders. We are proud of our members’ ability to grow the business in the short term while embracing changes that we believe will enhance the long-term opportunity.” _______________ 1 See Schedule A – “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more detail. Mr. Johnson continued, “The changes we are applying globally, such as first order limits, have been tested in key markets and proven to drive positive results in terms of long term sustainable growth. China, Russia and parts of Europe are all great examples of markets that are stronger now than they were before we implemented such changes. “While these initiatives may continue to moderate near-term volumes and sales growth, we know from our experience in those markets that have already adopted them, that they enhance the experience of our members and their customers, and position us for even greater future success. Our industry-leading Gold Standard consumer protections, changes designed to encourage our newest members to grow their businesses prudently, and a focus on growing a customer base of life-long customers all help our members become more productive and successful leaders. We know that these initiatives work, and coupled with the strength of our business model, the efficacy of our products and the power of our brand, will lead the company into its next phase of growth.” Third Quarter 2014 Key Metrics2,3 Regional Volume Point and Average Active Sales Leader Metrics Volume Points (Mil) Average Active Sales LeadersRegion 3Q'14 Yr/Yr % Chg 3Q'14 Yr/Yr % ChgNorth America 303.0(4%)77,218 4%Asia Pacific (ex.

The following is a reconciliation of net income, presented and reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, to net income adjusted for certain items: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 9/30/14 9/30/139/30/149/30/13(in thousands) Net income, as reported $ 11,248 $ 141,950 $ 205,408 $ 403,985Remeasurement and impairment losses relating to Venezuela (1)(2) 83,717 12 152,878 8,319Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the Company's business model (1)(3) 4,543 5,485 13,459 20,589Expenses incurred for the re-audit of 2010 to 2012 financial statements (1)(4) - 4,640 - 7,301Expenses related to the FTC inquiry (1)(5) 2,776 - 6,541 -Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit fees (1)(6) (33 ) - 378 -Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (7)9,927 - 25,936 -Legal reserve for the Bostick case (1)(8) 11,279 - 11,279 -Impairment of newly acquired defective manufacturing equipment (1)(9) 1,651 - 1,651 -Net income, as adjusted $ 125,108 $ 152,087 $ 417,530 $ 440,194 The following is a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share, presented and reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, to diluted earnings per share adjusted for certain items: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 9/30/14 9/30/139/30/149/30/13 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 0.13 $ 1.32 $ 2.22 $ 3.75Remeasurement loss relating to Venezuela (1)(2) 0.97 - 1.65 0.08Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the Company's business model (1)(3) 0.05 0.05 0.15 0.19Expenses incurred for the re-audit of 2010 to 2012 financial statements (1)(4) - 0.04 - 0.07Expenses related to the FTC inquiry (1)(5) 0.03 - 0.07 -Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit fees (1)(6) - - - -Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (7)0.12 - 0.28 -Legal reserve for the Bostick case (1)(8) 0.13 - 0.12 -Impairment of newly acquired defective manufacturing equipment (1)(9) 0.02 - 0.02 -Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (10)$ 1.45 $ 1.41 $ 4.51 $ 4.08 (1) Based on interim income tax reporting rules, these expenses are not considered discrete items. As a result, the Company's full year effective tax rate is impacted by these items. When applying the full year effective tax rate to year-to-date income, the Company's year-to-date tax provision recorded with respect to these non-GAAP adjustments is different from the forecasted full-year tax provision impact of these items. As a consequence, adjustments to the year-to-date and quarterly tax impacts will be recorded as the adjusted full year effective tax rate is applied to income in subsequent periods. Additionally, adjustments to items unrelated to these non-GAAP adjustments may have an effect on the income tax impact of these non-GAAP adjustments in subsequent periods. The Company plans to update the income tax impact of these items in subsequent interim reporting periods.(2) Net of $55,801 and $(12) tax benefit for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively; and net of $76,118 and $6,796 tax benefit for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(3) Net of $1,461 and $773 tax benefit for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively; and net of $4,827 and $3,241 tax benefit for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(4) Net of $1,533 and $2,329 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, respectively.(5) Net of $1,817 and $4,095 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014, respectively.(6) Net of $93 and $96 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014, respectively.(7) Relates to non-cash expense on our convertible notes and prepaid forward share repurchase contract.(8) Net of $6,221 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014.(9) Net of $913 tax benefit for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014.(10) Amounts may not total due to rounding.The following is a reconciliation of total long-term debt to net debt: 9/30/14 12/31/13 Total long-term debt (current and long-term portion) $ 1,827,919 $ 931,269Less: Cash and cash equivalents 678,134 972,974Net debt $ 1,149,785 $ (41,705 ) Contact:Herbalife Ltd.Media Contact:Julian CacchioliVP, Worldwide Corp.

Five years ago, Dalene and Peter Heck were toiling in cushy, lucrative corporate jobs in Alberta, Canada. Life was good, if monotonous. Then came a deluge of personal trials, family illnesses, and tragic accidents.  The Hecks had a realization: Life is short and you have to make the most of it. The two made the radical decision to quit their jobs, sell their possessions, and embark on a life of travel.  They booked a flight to South America with no real plan, except that they would start by using their savings to fund their travels. They had no idea how or if they would be able to make their hoped-for life of 24/7 travel sustainable. Five years later, they’ve taught English in Turkey, lived near a volcano in Ecuador, kayaked in Scandinavia, and nearly been swept off a mountain in Peru. They started a blog along the way, Hecktic Travels, which is bursting with gorgeous photos of the many places they’ve been and fun anecdotes from their tribulations on the road. While they initially thought travel blogging might be a way to fund their adventures, they quickly found it to be time-consuming and poorly paid. So they started Hektic Media, which connects travel brands with travel bloggers. The new enterprise has been a far more lucrative endeavor. “Travel blogging is the wild west in many ways. We know a lot of people that do good work and we meet a lot of companies that want to work with them, but they don’t know where to start. We help connect the two and help manage entire campaigns,” explains Dalene Heck. The couple was recently named the Travelers of the Year by National Geographic.   FREE AppDownload
Sprint on Monday announced earnings for last quarter. It posted a loss of $0.19 per share and announced that it would cut 2,000 jobs. The stock is down about 6% in after-hours trading. Net operating revenue for the quarter was almost $8.5 billion. The operating loss was $192 million. Sprint also lost 272,000 post-paid subscribers. The carrier has been going through an odd transition lately as it faces increased competition from T-Mobile, a smaller rival. AT&amp;T and Verizon are also growing and doing well. Sprint attempted to buy T-Mobile this summer but abandoned those plans after determining the deal would not be approved by US regulators. Instead, Sprint's then-CEO Dan Hesse stepped down, and Marcelo Claure got the job. Now Sprint and T-Mobile are battling to become the nation's third-largest wireless carrier. (AT&amp;T and Verizon are so big that it would be tough for T-Mobile or Sprint to catch up anytime soon.)

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidNEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group &lt;aig.n&gt; on Monday reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings, bolstered in part by improved performance at core insurance operations. After-tax operating income jumped 23 percent. Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock said the company remains "disciplined in our approach to balancing growth, profitability, and risk and focused on maintaining the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet." The company also declared a dividend of 12.5 cents per share as it did in the previous quarter. In addition, AIG's board authorized a further up to $1.5 billion share buybacks, in addition to the $3.4 billion of AIG stock the insurer has repurchased this year. Hancock took the reins at the company on Sept. 1 from his previous post as head of the company's property-casualty business. Hancock succeeded Bob Benmosche, who was widely credited with helping turn the company around after bad bets on derivatives nearly sank the company during the financial crisis. The company has since focused more closely on its core businesses. It reinstated a dividend last year. For the third quarter, AIG reported net income of $2.19 billion, or $1.52 per share, compared with net income of $2.17 billion, or $1.46 per share, a year earlier. After-tax operating income rose to $1.7 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.4 billion, or $0.96 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In property casualty, net premiums earned rose about 2 percent to $8.63 billion, and the combined ratio rose to 102.0 from 101.6. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims. In commercial underwriting, net premiums earned rose about 4 percent to $5.34 billion, and the combined ratio rose to 101.1 from 100.2. In consumer underwriting, net premiums earned remained flat at about $3.27 billion. The combined ratio fell to 98.8 from 99.9. Shares of AIG have risen about 5 percent from the end of last year through Friday. The S&amp;P 500 gained about 9 percent over the same time.   (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Amit DaveWe got a mixed read on the US manufacturing sector on Monday.Stocks finished Monday little changed, with the S&amp;P 500 hitting a new all-time intraday high before losing ground late in the day to close with a small loss. Crude oil was the big loser on Monday, with prices settling below $79 for the first time since the summer of 2012.  First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. Oil crashed. Again. Crude oil prices, which have been near $80 a barrel for the last few weeks or so took another leg lower late in the day on Monday, quickly dropping more than $2 to settle below $79 for the first time since June 2012. The drop in oil came late in the day, but about an hour after reports that Saudi Arabia cut its official price for deliveries. Crude oil, which is down more than 20% this year and is in a bear market, could also have an impact in the bond market. Business Insider's Sam Ro noted that currently, about 15% of the high-yield, or "junk," bond market is made up by energy companies.  2. The pace of auto sales in October rose from the prior month. According to data from Wards Auto, the pace of auto sales climbed to 16.35 million in October, while AutoData statistics said sales came in at a pace of 16.5 million. September's auto sales came in at an annualized pace of 16.34 million. In a note to clients Jesse Hurwitz of Barclays wrote that October sales were little changed from September, and while they came in "broadly in line" with expectations, sales were below the second quarter average of 16.8 million. 3. In the US, we also got three pieces of economic data. Manufacturing data from Markit Economics showed that manufacturing activity slowed to its slowest past since July, with Markit's PMI reading coming in at 55.9 against expectations for a reading of 56.2. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI came in at 59.0, better than the 56.1 that was expected by economists.  4. Also on the economic data front, construction spending in September fell for a second straight month, dropping 0.4% to an annual rate of $950.9 billion. The report also showed that investment in both public and private projects declined in September.  5. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest Sell Side Indicator survey, Wall Street equity strategists are so bearish on stocks, it might be time to buy. In a note to clients Monday morning, Savita Subramanian and the equity strategy team at BAML wrote that that "we remain encouraged by Wall Street's ongoing lack of optimism and the fact that strategists are still recommending that investors significantly underweight equities." When the Sell Indicator has been this low or lower, BAML said, total stock returns have been positive over the next year 96% of the time.  6. Bill Gross released his latest investment outlook, which talked about the need for not just central banking stimulus, but real fiscal stimulus from the government. And while Gross touched on some of his investment outlook, his post was also about so much more.  Don't Miss: The Man Who Got Britain Through The Recession Now Says We're 'Very Exposed' To A New Debt Crisis » FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Rebecca CookThe pace of US auto sales climbed in October. According to AutoData, the annualized rate of sales climbed to 16.5 million.  Wards Auto estimates the pace increased to 16.35 million. This was up from 16.34 million in September, but mixed relative to the 16.4 million forecasted by analysts. "The Detroit Three (plus Tesla) grabbed 45.6% of October sales, giving up a half-share point from year-ago, with combined deliveries of 580,147," Wards' John Sousanis said. "The group's 4.9% year-over-year gain was just below its 5% year-to-date improvement. "Asia-based automakers posted the largest monthly growth of any group, with 567,996 sales in October equating to a 7.8% increase in daily sales good for a 44.6% share of the market, compared with a 43.9% share last year."

REUTERS/StringerZhang Wuyi sits in his newly made multi-seater submarine at his new workshop near an artificial pool in Wuhan, Hubei province, November 14, 2012.It's widely recognized that American inventors such as Alexander Bell, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford helped turn the American dream into a reality. But these days, many inventors are coming from a different economic juggernaut — China. According to China Daily, 210,000 invention patents were given out in the country last year, a 25% increase over 2011. In this slideshow we've included pictures from China's DIY inventors: industrious men and women inventing in their backyard.

A Japanese whiskey is the best in the world, according to one of the top industry guides. The 2015 edition of Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible gave the crown to the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013. The bible will be published next week. Scottish liquor did not feature in the top five, according to the Daily Mail, which got an advance copy of the guide.  The title of best European whiskey went to English Whisky Company's Chapter 14 Not Peated. In the book, Murray wonders what happened to Scottish whisky, via the Daily Mail: ‘Where were the blends which offered bewildering layers of depth? ‘Where were the malts which took you on hair-standing journeys through dank and dingy warehouses? ‘Some have taken their eye off the ball and not brought into account the changes which have altered the face of whisky. ‘They began to believe their own PR hype and standard brands started standing still or going backwards.’ Murray sampled 4,700 varieties of whiskey for his bible.

Technological advances in hydraulic fracturing have fueled what some call the Great American Shale Boom. Oil and natural gas extracted from shale basins have left the US flush with energy. It's been a boon for US energy-related jobs and equipment suppliers. But it's not cheap to tap these so-called unconventional plays. In other words, crashing oil prices will soon make many of these energy sources money-losing projects. Morgan Stanley estimates the average breakeven oil price for these US plays to be about $76 to $77 per barrel. Goldman Sachs puts that number at closer to $75. If the price of oil can't cover production expenses and these companies are forced to idle their operations, then you could expect spending to drop, jobs to get cut, and delinquencies and defaults to rise. To make matters more complicated, many of these energy companies are financing their operations by borrowing in the junk-bond market, which means borrowing rates are relatively high. "As oil prices have fallen recently, so have prices of high-yield bonds," Charles Schwab's Collin Martin wrote in October. When bond prices fall, rates rise. "Oil prices can have a broad impact on the high-yield bond market because energy corporations have been increasing their share of the high-yield bond market. Today, energy companies make up more than 15% of the Barclays U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index. That's up from less than 5% of the index at the end of 2005—and the chart below shows that the share has been steadily increasing over the past decade." Even worse, this comes as interest rates are broadly expected to go higher from here: Charles Schwab FREE AppDownload

Crude oil is getting crushed. Again. In afternoon trade on Monday, crude oil prices fell quickly to below $79 from more than $81 earlier in the day. The drop in crude also took US equity markets off their best levels, with only the Nasdaq currently holding on to gains. Earlier on Monday, the S&amp;P 500 had been trading near a new all-time intraday high above 2,022.  Crude prices briefly spiked after headlines crossing Reuters said that Saudi Arabia increased its per barrel price for shipments to Asia for November. Saudi Arabia, however, cut prices on shipments to the US. The quick drop in crude on Monday brought the commodity to yet another multi-year low, and the lowest level of its most recent breakdown, which has been in place since late summer. Here's the intraday chart of crude oil's drop.  FinViz FREE AppDownload
 A watch like the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser has the power to polarize watch lovers. It isn't that people will disagree on its quality or mechanics, but rather, the entire concept is something which people either love or simply can't stand behind. Whether you can pull off a Freak on the wrist is a question high-end watch lovers all need to ask themselves at some point. It may seem like a small issue, but it goes to the heart of what type of watch lover you are. Let me be clear that I am personally a Ulysse Nardin Freak kinda guy, but I don't have anything against people who aren't. It is really just a matter of your taste and personality. I've written a lot about the Ulysse Nardin Freak watch collection over the years, and this isn't my first Freak watch review. Several years ago, in 2011, I reviewed the higher-end Ulysse Nardin Freak Diavolo watch (which in a different color was later called the Ulysse Nardin Freak Phantom). The Freak Diavolo and Phantom are currently the most high-end Freak models because they include tourbillons in the movements as part of the in-house produced caliber UN-208 movements. A valid argument could be made that, while cool, adding a tourbillon to the Freak concept is sort of overkill. In monetary terms, the different in price between a Freak watch with tourbillon and this Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser is a cool $50,000.  There is nothing at all wrong with wanting a tourbillon to spice up your watches, but I am rarely convinced of their value proposition unless you are frequently doing business with difficult to impress oligarchs. Tourbillons, in many parts of the world, exist to show off wealth and prestige. Lovers of watch movements appreciate their complexity and attractive aesthetics, but they don't really add much to the overall horological equation when it comes to performance. In many ways tourbillons are like the chrome trim of the watch world - often worth it when you want to look your best, but you aren't really adding a ton of value for their cost. Coming back to the Ulysse Nardin Freak watch collection, I think you get your money's worth of Freak in the Cruiser or other models that focus more on the core concept of what the watch is about. How do you explain to a lay person what is going on in the Freak? The dial is confusing at first, with a bunch of colors and moving parts, and the odd case has no crown. I'd start by pointing out that much of the movement, which is normally under the dial, is presented right on top of the dial. In fact, the entire running train of gears is incorporated into the minute hand. Underneath it is another hand for the hours - and the time is the only thing the watch displays. The next level of explanation should discuss silicon - part of what the Freak watch family has been all about since Ulysse Nardin debuted it in the early 2000s.A Blog To Watch The Ulysse Nardin Freak is the first watch that I am aware of that used silicon versus metal parts for elements of the movement. The reason the movement was designed to be on the dial itself was to make this point clear - especially because silicon does not look like metal, with its alternating blue and purple colors. You can see more close-up pictures of the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser watch here when we first debuted it last year. In the watch, silicon is used for both the balance spring as well as the double escapements. Yes, the movement uses not one, but two escapements, which should lead to better accuracy over time. This is all part of the in-house made and designed Ulysse Nardin caliber UN-205. For me, this is the most desirable Freak movement to date, as it successfully combines a slick design with the features you should expect in a Ulysse Nardin Freak watch at a good price. The movement features one large mainspring barrel which offers a full 7 days of power reserve. Flip the watch over, and on its rear you'll see small cutaways offering a view of the mainspring. While not as precise as a dedicated power reserve indicator, you can more or less know if you need to wind the watch by seeing how tightly wound the spring is. A Blog To Watch Setting the Ulysse Nardin Freak, as well as winding it, is a unique ritual. This is because the watch has no crown. Setting it is much easier than winding it. If you look at the case, right over the lower strap between the lugs is a small latch. When pulled up the bezel unlocks, and when turned in either direction then allows you to set the time. This is a great system, and makes setting the time both simple and precise. In some ways, it is better than a crown. The same concept is used to wind the watch, but you use the rear caseback bezel. Here, the system fails a bit, even though it is doable. In my experience, the rear bezel was extremely stiff, but moved a bit once you got it going. This is an issue because you not only need to move the slippery surface with your fingers, but you need to do it for a really long time to fully wind the watch. Doing it with your hand sort of sucks, but it is necessary as the movement is manually wound. I did find a workaround that worked well for me. I believe that in the video part of the review I mention this. Basically, you need to find a small rubber ball (like the ones they sell to open screw-down casebacks). This grips the rear of the case perfectly, and makes winding the movement simple, because turning the caseback becomes worlds easier. So on the plus side, this only needs to be done weekly, but on the downside, it isn't very fun unless you have such a tool. Ulysse Nardin should really provide a ball or similar tool when selling the Freak watches. A Blog To Watch What at first appears to be a weird dial becomes remarkably legible, once you get used to it. The hour and minute hands aren't difficult to spot, and they are even coated with luminant for darkness reading of the dial. I can easily understand how someone new to the Ulysse Nardin Freak would be intimidated by the dial, but living with it for a few days really makes you understand how the name of the watch only describes a sort of surface-level impression of the overall design and concept. Let's be clear that the Freak family is weird, but a lot of what it does makes sense and is logical. There is nothing here that is so strange or illogical that it would keep movement lovers away. In fact, the entire concept of the watch being different, yet very functional, is why I so very like it. Ulysse Nardin Freak fans who have had experience with previous generation Freak models will appreciate some of the upgrades in the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser. The fundamentals are unchanged, but Ulysse Nardin did refine the watch in a lot of important ways. That means even if you have a previous generation Ulysse Nardin Freak, it might be time to upgrade. Having said that, the last time I spoke with Ulysse Nardin about the Freak, they said that the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser would not replace the base Freak, but exist as an upgraded model above it in the product family. A Blog To Watch What's improved in the Freak Cruiser over the Freak? First, there are a few non-improvement aesthetic changes such as the design of the movement bridges and the dial. There is also a new style of bezel design. These are just a matter of taste. I like them all, but I sort of prefer the bezel design of the original Freak. Having said that, I like the dial/movement design of the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser more. Functional changes include better water resistance - which means just some water resistance at 30 meters - as well as no more pin through the sapphire crystal. That's right, the original Freak was impaled by a spike. Well, it was functional. A pin acted to secure the movement and it needed to be mounted to the top sapphire crystal. Running you hand over the crystal of a Freak allowed you to feel the rounded metal nub of the pin, but with the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser, all that is gone. The UN-205 movement is fully mounted from below, so the Freak no longer has a pin through it. Note that this improvement first started with the Freak Diavolo. A Blog To Watch At 45mm wide on the wrist and in 18k rose gold, the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser is certainly not inconspicuous or "under the radar" when it comes to looks or wear. It is, however, comfortable on the attached brown alligator strap. The black part of the bezel is filled in with vulcanized rubber (for looks more than anything else). If you like large watches with a bold style, then a watch like this is most certainly for you. If you prefer more understated elegance and luxury, then the Ulysse Nardin Freak Cruiser will feel like an obnoxious sidekick on your wrist. That, for me, is where people disagree on the watch. If you like odd things and are attracted to "different" (as many watch lovers are), then the Ulysse Nardin Freak is perhaps your grail watch. If you are very conservative in your tastes and only like those things which are highly refined and familiar, then you'll never want to wear one of these, even though you likely appreciate what went into its design and construction. At the end of the day, I think there is a lot of mutual respect for the Ulysse Nardin Freak concept, but it is one of the major dividing points where lovers of watches are separated in their opinions on wearing it. Are you a Freak kinda person? I'd love to hear why or why not in the comments below. As I've stated above, those who know me aren't surprised by my preference for watches like this. To be different, and highly successful at it, fits my definition of cool.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thirteen years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the first tenants moved their belongings into the newly built One World Trade Center with enthusiasm tinged by emotional remembrance. About 200 Condé Nast employees on Monday walked through the revolving doors of the building, America's tallest skyscraper - the first wave of 3,400 company staffers to occupy the 104-story gleaming tower in Lower Manhattan by February 2015. Chief among them was Condé Nast's chief executive, Charles Townsend, whose gray Mercedes rolled into the tower's south entrance, where he was greeted by developers and other officials. "This is a terrific day for Lower Manhattan, a wonderful day for New York City and an absolutely great day for Condé Nast," Townsend said. The publishing company, which owns The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and other magazines, is the first renter to set up offices in the tower, where it will occupy floors 20 to 44. Other Condé Nast employees entering their company's new headquarters consistently echoed their leader's excitement while downplaying reservations about the site's security. "I can understand the fear," said Vijay Ramcharitar, a finance analyst at Condé Nast. "But I don't think you look at this building with fear, you look at it with inspiration." One World Trade Center stands on the location where more than 2,700 people perished when hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001. It is directly across from the 9/11 Memorial. Some spoke of history going full circle at last. Maryanne Casey, who works for a legal affiliate of Condé Nast, said moving into her new office evoked particularly personal memories. She once worked at the World Trade Center and her firefighter brother helped in the aftermath of the attacks. "It's a great tribute to America to see this," she said. "I'm very proud to work here." The new building is more than 58 percent leased, according to a statement from the Durst Organization, a real estate company that manages the property jointly with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Construction workers who helped the $3.9 billion tower rise from the rubble, overcoming repeated delays that pushed back the original 2006 completion date, put finishing touches on the building's glass exterior and watched with pride as its first tenants settled in. "It's a great building," said one worker wearing a hard hat and yellow vest.   (Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Steve Orlofsky) FREE AppDownload
Rurik Jutting / FacebookRurik Jutting poses with a friend.A drug-using investment banker has allegedly murdered two prostitutes in Hong Kong. It’s a pretty jarring headline – a real-life American Psycho. But most bankers I know aren’t really all that surprised. People have been calling him Patrick Bateman. Perhaps he has an alibi and was out returning video tapes. But instead I see Colonel Kurtz. What happens when you take the “Best of the West,” presumably well-raised, Cambridge-educated, and well-paid, and you throw him into an alternate reality, a world largely without societal restraints and an industry with its set of deviant moral benchmarks? For some people, and maybe for Rurik Jutting, things fall apart. Hong Kong is a tropical island masquerading as a legitimate city. To a large extent, expat bankers in Asia can do whatever they want. As an overhang of colonialism, they tend to get treated better than locals. They can start food fights at The Mandarin Grill, flee the scene of a car crash, or take their pants off and run around Lan Kwai Fong. And if they get so out-of-control that they get banned from 3 bars in one night, the cops will just take them home. Many of my Chinese friends will speak English when they make dinner reservations or if they walk into a Gucci store, because even acting like an ABC (American Born Chinese) gets them better treatment. My sense of reality and entitlement got so warped in Hong Kong that when I would come back to the US to visit family, my mother suggested I walk around Wal-Mart just to re-acclimate myself and “be less of an a------.” The alleged murderer, Rurik Jutting, lived in the J-Residence building in Wan Chai, one of Hong Kong’s seedier and less prestigious areas. At around US$ 4,000 a month, the building is popular with young bankers and (poor) expats who like to be close to Central but cant afford to live in the Mid-Levels or on The Peak. Rurik lived two blocks away from Lockhart Road, the aorta of Hong Kong’s red light district. He couldn’t walk home at night without getting propositioned by street walking freelancers and the pros standing in front of the velvet curtain bars. “You very handsome man” and “Just one drink okay la.” It’s an entire street filled with bars like Cockeyes, where we once hosted intern drinks (The Princelings loved it), and the now-closed Fenwicks, where we once staked out our regional head of sales, "Dirty Sanchez," until we caught him walking out at 3am on Tuesday with a love monkey on each arm. The TelegraphThe Telegraph reports that these women were Jutting's victims.Before moving to Asia, I highly doubt Rurik Jutting was ever called handsome by anyone other than his mom. He’s what we call a “Twelve” – the term used in Asia to describe an ugly white guy with a young, attractive, usually paid-for Asian girl. He’s a two and she’s a ten. It’s also been reported that the police also found a small amount of cocaine in his apartment. Now, I have no idea what kind of person Rurik is, but I do know that investment banking is a culture of pervasive deviance, particularly in Asia. When I first moved to Hong Kong, the first thing one of the outgoing (repatriated) hedge fund sales guys gave me was the number of his drug dealer. “Look, I don’t really know you, but trust me, you’ll need this for your clients.” And everyone knew it when Drug Dealer Joe’s not-too-subtle Toyota Supra would show up in front of Cheung Kong Center or ICBC Tower (where Merrill Lynch is) for a delivery. It’s often not even a function of choice. I had a colleague get chastised by our boss for not attending an important client’s bachelor party trip to Manila. “You have a pregnant wife at home, so what?” I think it was the non-forwardable Bloomberg message itinerary titled “A Weekend of Debauchery” that scared him off. And he paid a price for not indulging – getting fewer trades than his more willingly deviant counterparts at other banks. One time I went to a dinner at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse where an investment banking colleague showed up with two prostitutes and proceeded to hold a contest to see which of them could keep their hand on the famously-hot plates the longest. Even formal closing dinners - a global banking tradition, where the bookrunners an clients celebrate the success of a deal in the private room of some fancy restaurant, get drunk, and hand out tombstones (Lucite deal trophies) and (in the good old days) inscribed Mont Blanc pens as mementos of their greatness – are not immune. My first closing dinner in Hong Kong was slightly different from those that I have experienced in New York or London. Toward the end of dinner, a senior banker quietly made it known that the CEO wanted the party to continue at a karaoke bar. To avoid creating an embarrassing or awkward scene for the client, the female bankers were asked to discreetly excuse themselves from dinner. The young analyst next to me got a Blackberry message from her boss, “Hey, maybe you should go home now.” One of my counterparts on the deal team – a pretty square, happily married guy – also tried to excuse himself from the evolving festivities. But, the CEO was having none of it. “Where the f--- do you think you’re going? I don’t think so.” And that was it – he knew that future business from this client (and therefore his bonus) depended on it. To be clear about what karaoke means – it’s a large private room where we sit around on couches, singing karaoke, drinking whiskey with iced green tie, and playing a dice version of Liar’s Poker. And then, the mama-san parades in at least thirty or forty girls in skimpy dresses, each one wearing a nametag with a number on it. From there, it doesn’t take long for the process to get started. “I’ll take number 12 and number 34.” Or “Dibs on 11.” And “Don’t be greedy; just get two.” The mama-san also provides drugs, but it’s like buying beer at Yankee Stadium, so it’s better to bring your own. At the end of the night, a bill is presented that says something like “Tokyo Otoro Sushi,” which is convenient when it comes to expensing it. After all, the tab can be astronomical, especially if people get “take-out.” There are plenty of bankers, especially sales guys who cover hedge funds (which are heavily populated by expats), who conduct regular meetings at massage parlors (during lunchtime) and karaoke joints (at night). So, Rurik Jutting, depending on how things play out for you, don’t forget – Jefferies is still hiring for equities in Asia, although you might be better off in Dallas.

The Horace Mann School is the best private high school in New York City, according to a new ranking from education review website Niche. Niche rankings are based on a combination of user reviews and education statistics sourced from the government and public databases. According to Niche, a school's high score indicates that "Students are very happy with their experiences in all aspects including academics, teachers, health, safety, resources, facilities, extracurriculars, sports, and fitness." Although Horace Mann is well known as an academic powerhouse, it has been more in the news recently for a sexual abuse scandal that reportedly took place at the school for decades. However, current students seem to love the school. As one recent Horace Mann alumnus wrote on Niche, "I've been in lecture-like classes (AP bio) and seminar-based classes. The teachers here expect the most from you and encourage you to deliver. They care enough about your personal well-being to pull you aside if something is off with you. Participating in class was never a problem because they wanted you to." Here are the 10 best private high schools in New York City, via Niche: [Note: Niche's private school ranking included Hunter College High School, which is a selective public school.] See the full national private school ranking at Niche &gt;&gt; FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersWorker works next to a furnace pouring out melted iron at a factory of the Dongbei Special Steel Group Co. Ltd., in DalianLONDON/SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity increased last month at the same modest pace as in September, suggesting the need for continued economic policy stimulus, especially in Europe.JPMorgan's Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, produced with Markit, held steady at 52.2 in October. But it was one of the lowest readings this year, suggesting factory activity is expanding slowly. "The global PMI continues to signal 3-4 percent annualized gains in manufacturing output as we head toward year-end," said David Hensley, a director at JPMorgan. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. Regional manufacturing surveys from Asia were littered with unwelcome landmarks, including a five-month low for activity in China, a four-month trough for South Korea and a 14-month low for Indonesia. Chinese factory activity unexpectedly fell to a five-month low in October, reinforcing views that the country's economic growth is slowing. The official Chinese Purchasing Managers' Index eased to 50.8 in October from September's 51.1, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday. A private Chinese factory survey by HSBC/Markit on Monday showed its manufacturing PMI edged up to 50.4 in October, from September's reading of 50.2. Though overall growth picked up slightly, growth in new orders and new export orders, proxies for domestic and foreign demand, fell to their lowest in four to five months. "There remains downward pressure on the economy, and monetary policy will remain easy," economists at China International Capital Corp said in a note to clients after the data. It has been a tough year for China's economy. Growth fell to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, its lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, as the housing market sagged and domestic demand and investment flagged. The cooldown is expected to be China's worst in 24 years this year, according to a Reuters poll. To encourage more growth, China has cut taxes, quickened some investment projects, lent short-term loans to banks, instructed local governments to spend their budgets and reduced the level of deposits some banks hold as reserves to spur lending. "Sentiment has slightly deteriorated on the back of the Chinese PMI. Overall, the data is disappointing," Credit Agricole economists said in a note to clients. A rare bright spot was India, where the HSBC PMI rose to 51.6 in October, from 51.0 in September, extending its run above 50 to a full year. Readings on Japanese activity were delayed by a holiday but will likely be overshadowed by the Bank of Japan's decision on Friday to further expand its massive bond buying program to stimulate the economy. Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at a slightly faster pace in October, but only tepid expansion in Germany and contractions in France and Italy will be disconcerting for the European Central Bank as it battles to prevent deflation. Some form of quantitative easing, or buying of government or corporate bonds, is one of the last policy options the ECB has left to fight deflation risks and rekindle economic growth in the monetary union. Markit's final October manufacturing PMI for the euro zone was 50.6, beating September's 50.3 but shy of an earlier flash estimate of 50.7. "The performance of euro zone manufacturing remained broadly flat at the start of the final quarter," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. "Manufacturing is therefore unlikely to provide any meaningful boost to the currency union's anemic GDP growth." Germany's manufacturing industry returned to modest growth last month but new business fell slightly for a second month as Russian sanctions and a general economic slowdown weighed on demand. Adding to the gloom, the surveys showed French factory activity contracted more quickly than in September, while Italian manufacturing slowed at the sharpest rate in 17 months. Outside the euro zone, British factories reported activity expanded at the fastest rate in three months in October. But weak demand from the euro zone, its main trading partner, sent export orders tumbling at the fastest pace since January 2013. Across the Atlantic, the manufacturing picture was also mixed in October, with U.S. factory activity slowing in the Markit PMI survey but expanding at its fastest growth rate in three and a half years, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Private data vendor Markit said its final U.S. October PMI fell to 55.9 from 57.5 in September. "The latest figures indicate that the recovery has lost some intensity at the start of the fourth quarter, reflecting subdued export demand from the euro area and key emerging markets," said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. However, ISM said its index of U.S. factory activity rose to 59 in October from 56.6 in September, bringing the index back to the same level it recorded in August, which was the highest since March 2011. "The overall growth outlook remains very resilient as the underlying strength in domestic demand clearly outweighs potential external headwinds," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research. Manufacturing sectors in Canada and Mexico, whose economies are linked to the U.S. market, both did well in October. The RBC/Markit Canadian PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.3 last month from 53.5 in September, the highest reading since November 2013. "We saw a strong uptick in Canada's manufacturing business conditions in October driven by new order growth," said Craig Wright, senior vice-president and chief economist at RBC. Mexico's HSBC/Markit PMI rose to 53.3 in October, after adjusting for seasonal variation, from 52.6 in September, a nine-month high. Mexico exports mostly manufactured goods and sends nearly 80 percent of its exports to the United States. Analysts expect the economy to expand by about 2.5 percent this year, with growth picking up after a weak start to the year. However, activity in Brazil's manufacturing sector declined for a second straight month in October. The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for Brazil's manufacturing sector dropped to 49.1 in October from 49.3 in September in seasonally adjusted terms. It was the sixth decline in the past seven months. Brazilian manufacturers have struggled for years with high interest rates, scarce labor and burdensome taxes. Ahead of the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff in October, the country endured a mild economic recession in the first half of the year.   (Editing by Toby Chopra, Clive McKeef and Dan Grebler) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersObama shakes hands with Yellen after announcing her nomination to head the Federal Reserve at the White House in WashingtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will discuss the long-term outlook of the U.S. economy during a White House meeting on Monday afternoon, Obama's spokesman said. Obama and Yellen were to hold their first one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said besides the U.S. economy, they will also discuss the global economy. Earnest said the meeting is significant in that it takes place a week before Obama travels to Asia for meetings that will include talks with world leaders about economic issues.

Podemos, the radical leftist party that was created earlier this year in Spain, is now the most popular political party in the country (see the crazy results from El País's election poll over the weekend). If the election were held tomorrow, Podemos would get 27.7% of the vote. The other two major parties, PSOE and PP, would get 26.2% and 20.7%, respectively. This is going to have major implications for Spain's political and economic stability. It's been more or less a two-party country since the end of the Franco era 40 years ago. Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, had this to say in a note Monday: One of the reasons why markets have taken a more sanguine view of Spain is that the country's political system always seemed more stable - particularly vis-à-vis Italy ... This perception was always a superficial one and is now positively flawed.  Political risk in Spain has been rising sharply of late. While investors have focused on the standoff between Barcelona and Madrid, they should be paying more attention to the surge in support for Podemos... At the very least, it has a strong chance of becoming the new left in Spain - and a much more militant, populist and anti-German one at that. Really, there's one number that explains the emergence and popularity of radical politics in Spain: 53.7%. That's the percentage of Spaniards under the age of 25 who are currently unemployed — more than double the already horrific 24% of all working-age Spaniards who are unemployed. This is the making of a lost generation, and an indication that Podemos is probably just getting started. EurostatData from Eurostat FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Amit DaveWe got a mixed read on the US manufacturing sector on Monday.Stocks finished Monday little changed, with the S&amp;P 500 hitting a new all-time intraday high before losing ground late in the day to close with a small loss. Crude oil was the big loser on Monday, with prices settling below $79 for the first time since the summer of 2012.  First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. Oil crashed. Again. Crude oil prices, which have been near $80 a barrel for the last few weeks or so took another leg lower late in the day on Monday, quickly dropping more than $2 to settle below $79 for the first time since June 2012. The drop in oil came late in the day, but about an hour after reports that Saudi Arabia cut its official price for deliveries. Crude oil, which is down more than 20% this year and is in a bear market, could also have an impact in the bond market. Business Insider's Sam Ro noted that currently, about 15% of the high-yield, or "junk," bond market is made up by energy companies.  2. The pace of auto sales in October rose from the prior month. According to data from Wards Auto, the pace of auto sales climbed to 16.35 million in October, while AutoData statistics said sales came in at a pace of 16.5 million. September's auto sales came in at an annualized pace of 16.34 million. In a note to clients Jesse Hurwitz of Barclays wrote that October sales were little changed from September, and while they came in "broadly in line" with expectations, sales were below the second quarter average of 16.8 million. 3. In the US, we also got three pieces of economic data. Manufacturing data from Markit Economics showed that manufacturing activity slowed to its slowest past since July, with Markit's PMI reading coming in at 55.9 against expectations for a reading of 56.2. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI came in at 59.0, better than the 56.1 that was expected by economists.  4. Also on the economic data front, construction spending in September fell for a second straight month, dropping 0.4% to an annual rate of $950.9 billion. The report also showed that investment in both public and private projects declined in September.  5. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest Sell Side Indicator survey, Wall Street equity strategists are so bearish on stocks, it might be time to buy. In a note to clients Monday morning, Savita Subramanian and the equity strategy team at BAML wrote that that "we remain encouraged by Wall Street's ongoing lack of optimism and the fact that strategists are still recommending that investors significantly underweight equities." When the Sell Indicator has been this low or lower, BAML said, total stock returns have been positive over the next year 96% of the time.  6. Bill Gross released his latest investment outlook, which talked about the need for not just central banking stimulus, but real fiscal stimulus from the government. And while Gross touched on some of his investment outlook, his post was also about so much more.  Don't Miss: The Man Who Got Britain Through The Recession Now Says We're 'Very Exposed' To A New Debt Crisis » FREE AppDownload

Peter Macdiarmid / Getty ImagesLord Turner in 2009, during his five-year stint as the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the UK's premier financial regulator.Lord Adair Turner is Britain's foremost technocrat. With a list of expert and management positions longer than the average arm, Turner was most recently the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, a post he took up in September 2008, a week after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and just as the Treasury and FSA were preparing to nationalise British bank Bradford &amp; Bingley.  Meeting Turner, it's easy to imagine him as a British version of Mario Monti, the Italian economist parachuted in (without election) to become Italian Prime Minister in 2011 after the Berlusconi government fell apart. He's often floated as a serious contender for high-level economic policy jobs, as he was the last time there was a vacancy for the position of Governor of the Bank of England.  He is now senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and is increasingly preoccupied with questions around the UK's debt levels. Particularly, he's interested in the pernicious effect of Britain's extremely high household debt on the economy's performance, why that happens, and how it might be counteracted.  The UK has some of the most highly-leveraged households in the advanced world, and although debt has dipped, it's still way above levels seen before the turn of the 21st century. Turner thinks this will pose huge problems for the country, leaving it more exposed to financial crises.  The idea has some trans-Atlantic resonance. Turner may be doing for the UK (and Europe) what Professors Atif Mian and Amir Sufi have done for the US. We asked him what he thinks of the British economy today, and what he's been working on.  Business Insider: How exposed are we to another financial crisis?  CEPR Geneva ReportAdair Turner: I think we’re still very exposed. Broadly speaking, what has happened since the crisis is that we have shifted leverage around the world but we haven’t gotten rid of it. This is the great conundrum to which we don’t yet have an answer. In the UK and Spain and in Ireland and most dramatically in the US, there has been some deleveraging. But there has been a more than offsetting increase in public sector debt. So for every percentage point decrease in private sector debt as a percentage of GDP, there’s been a more than percentage point increase in public debt. Total leverage across the global economy has gone up. We still don’t seem to know how to run our economies without credit growing somewhere faster than GDP, but that produces an eventual crisis. BI: You've mentioned that you think that inequality is a factor here. Could you explain that?  AT: We have a trend in our societies towards rising inequality with more income being accumulated by people who don’t need more income. If it were not for the credit system, we would truly face a secular stagnation. There were various people in the mid 1930s and 1940s who talked about it, Keynes talked about it in the General Theory. Oxford Economics Because rich people can essentially get paid more and put money into the financial system which then lends money to middle income and poorer people. The system balances, and what we have is an increase in credit which does not produce an excess of expenditure and therefore inflation. It simply takes us back to the level of expenditure there would have been if income had been distributed in a more equal fashion in the first place. Let’s suppose we lend against existing real estate. Imagine a country that’s building no new houses at all. But there is an expansion of credit, an increase in asset prices … What you can get there is an increase in credit, in the vulnerability of the economy, which is not essential to the growth process, but which can screw up the growth process when it goes wrong. BI: So is part of your complaint about modern economics? AT: There is a general amnesia of modern economics of the last 30 or 50 years, as it has become more formal or mathematical, to ignore the insights of many people of the early and mid 20th century who wrote in a less mathematical style.  So I think there are many insights in Knut Wicksell, in Hayek, in Schumpeter, in Keynes, in Fisher, in Simons et cetera. A lot of economists never read those people, and have moved away from their insights, and gravitated towards a highly mathematical description of economics in which there was a set of assumptions about rational expectations, complete markets and competitive equilibrium … There were a variety of reasons why those sort of insights which we could have had 10 or 15 years ago about the impact of inequality on an increasingly credit intensive economy. Institute for Fiscal Studies BI: You were the UK's chief financial regulator as the crisis hit. What do you think of Britain's regulatory policies as they're unfolding now? AT: I think we’re doing fine preparatory work … we are currently in the environment where we’re still dealing with the post-crisis debt overhang rather than the exuberant upswing. So almost definition, we’re not testing a set of macroprudential tools on the exuberance ... We’ve got some signs of a house price boom but it’s a complicated situation because it’s been regionally focused. There’s no house price boom in Newcastle or Edinburgh or Glasgow. I think the bigger issue is in the downswing of the crisis, what is the balance between fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus? What are the policy tools which are not pushing on a string? I’ve become increasingly convinced that the only one which is not pushing on a string is fiscal… fiscal stimulus says ‘I have cut your taxes’, or ‘I am going to employ you to build a road’. It clearly has a much more direct entrance into the income stream than a set of indirect levers that says ‘well there is some central bank money available to the commercial banks to lend money at cheap rates if somebody wants to borrow it’.

Apple and General Electric are by far the most popular stocks among US retail investors, a FutureAdvisor study of 161,000 investors shows. Apple was the most widely held stock in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and General Electric was the second­most in 30 states plus DC, the study shows. In three states Apple was No. 2, and in Wyoming, General Electric was No. 1. While Apple has the largest market capitalization among US companies, being popular among retail investors —meaning individuals trading for their personal accounts — does not always follow. ExxonMobil, No. 2 for market cap, is 30th in popularity among retail investors covered by the FutureAdvisor study. General Electric consistently ranks eighth by market cap among US companies, yet comes in second among individual investors. Some companies are inordinately popular despite relatively low market caps, led by Tesla, Ford and Starbucks: all consumer­-facing brands. Tesla and Ford are the last two automakers to IPO in America, Tesla in 2010 and Ford in 1956. (Ford was also the only member of the Big Three car makers not to take a bailout after 2008 … ) In general, we can say that the companies most popular with retail investors tend to have a consumer focus, as opposed to B2B firms, with special emphasis for automakers, technology firms, and food providers. FutureAdvisor analyzed data from 161,000 U.S. investors to determine which stocks were most popular in the country, and then broke it down state by state. Of those 161,000, only 88,000 declared their state of residence. FutureAdvisor This article originally appeared at FutureAdvisor.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
Here's one reason the housing recovery hasn't been quite as robust as it could have been: roommates. Millennials living in their parents' basement is a somewhat tired trope, but the idea of doubling up — moving in with a roommate (or a family member) because incomes are stagnant and rents are rising — is a real phenomenon. A new report out from Zillow shows that the number of adults in doubled up households increased to almost a third of all households, from 25.4% back in 2000. That's a loss of 5.4 million potential household formations. A lot of these missing household formations are in places where rents are rising faster than income (Florida, California, New York, etc.). According to the report, the silver lining is that there could be a lot of pent up demand for new housing once these doubled up households are read to strike out on their own. But there's no indication of exactly when this might happen. Wage growth, although finally showing some signs of life, still isn't accelerating faster than average rents. And then, there's this: "On average, doubled-up adults make 76 percent of the median income of people without roommates, which means it can take longer to save up for a down payment or deposit on a place of their own," according to Zillow. Here's the breakdown by metropolitan area: Zillow FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesSoros Fund Management Chairman George Soros testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 13, 2008.Argentine bond investors are still waiting to get paid — and they're starting to get restless. After all, if this summer's technical default didn't end the stalemate between Argentina and its holdout hedge fund creditors, what will? The question remains uncertain (and investors hate uncertainty, obviously), so bondholders of all stripes — those who took haircuts on Argentine sovereign debt dating to the country's 2001 default, and those who did not — are working on more creative ways to recover their money. In the latest twist of all the many twists, legendary investor George Soros and Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass have both filed suit with a UK judge, asking that he release $282 million worth of interest payments on their investment in the country, according to Bloomberg's Kit Chellel. That payment has been held up by the fact that a US court ruled that bondholders who did restructure their debt (like Bass and Soros) cannot be paid until bondholders who did not restructure (like hedge fund manager Paul Singer) are also paid. That ruling is what tipped Argentina into default on July 30. When Buenos Aires tried to make a payment to exchange bondholders and not the holdouts, that payment was stopped by a US court. Since then, the country has made attempts to change the jurisdiction of the bonds from New York City to Buenos Aires, and has tried to change the custodial bank in charge of payment distribution too. So far, though, investors have not gotten paid. Now Soros, Bass, and a few others are arguing that they are "innocent third parties" in this whole debacle and shouldn't be punished for Argentina's holdout spat. Meanwhile, they also argue, what's an English court doing upholding a US court order anyway? Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, met with George Soros in New York City in September. They discussed Argentina's energy sector. It's got a lot of promise because of the country's large quantities of natural gas, but its development requires investment. And that investment isn't coming in full until this whole debt issue is cleared up. So there's that. Another powerful player has also come into the game — a new holdout with more at stake than Paul Singer. Billionaire Kenneth Darth owns $595 million worth of defaulted Argentine bonds to Singer’s $503 million.  Last week Dart asked a New York Judge to give his claim the same treatment as Paul Singer's. According to BloombergBusinessweek's Sheelah Kolhatkar, this could be very costly for Argentina: In addition to Dart, there are approximately $2.4 billion worth of bonds out there that are governed by New York law and in the hands of other holdout investors. The minute Argentina settles with Singer’s group and the bondholder payments are allowed to flow through, all the other holdouts will likely rush forward to Judge Thomas Griesa’s court, demanding the same legal rulings and the same terms, which could block the payments again.  That would mean that even after Argentina paid the Paul Singer and his company (The Gang of Five, as they're called) the country would still be in default until it paid out the other holdouts. This is what happens when you put things off. FREE AppDownload
Reuters/RIA Novosti/Pool/Alexei DruzhininPresident Vladimir Putin.The Russian economy is in dire straits. Growth is flatlining, the government's budget is being squeezed, and international sanctions over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis are combining to squeeze Moscow. However, the reasons for Russia's decline predate the country's current crisis and have as much to do with long-term trends like an aging population and declining labor productivity as with the recent collapse of the oil price (and with it the ruble). The choices faced by Russian policymakers are stark. They can either attempt to fight the decline by spending the country's precious foreign exchange reserves. Or they can let the currency float free and risk financial instability that could crush businesses. So far they have opted for the former. The central bank burned more than $15 billion last month in an attempt to soften the ruble's fall. But it has failed to instill confidence either domestically or internationally.

Thomson ReutersFalcone, the head of Harbinger Capital Partners, which owns LightSquared, arrives at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in ManhattanBy Nick Brown NEW YORK (Reuters) - LightSquared, the bankrupt wireless venture owned by Phil Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners, has reached a deal to bring the company out of bankruptcy under control of lenders, according to a person close to the matter. Harbinger had been fighting to keep at least some control of LightSquared by breaking up the company. However, the deal would keep the company together while distributing equity to lenders including Charles Ergen, chairman of Dish Network Corp , said the person, who declined to be named because the deal is not public. The agreement comes on the heels of a second round of mediation, and sides have scheduled a hearing on Monday afternoon to reveal details of those talks. Harbinger and Ergen had been embroiled in fierce litigation for more than a year over allegations by Harbinger that Ergen used underhanded means to acquire LightSquared's loan debt with an eye toward taking control of its assets on Dish's behalf. Ergen insisted he was interested in LightSquared only for his personal account. The new deal still needs to be memorialized in a Chapter 11 plan, but appears to be a blow to Harbinger's hopes of salvaging control of LightSquared. The deal has enough support from stakeholders to receive court approval, the person said. LightSquared, which promised high-speed wireless coverage across the United States, filed for chapter 11 protection in 2012 after regulators barred it from using its wireless spectrum because of fears of GPS interference.

Bill Gross is out with his latest investment outlook. Like Gross, it is an enigmatic, mercurial, and meandering piece of writing that, basically, says the government needs to spend money.  But more than Gross' outlook on the economy, it is his introduction that may — again — ask investors just what is going on with the man once known as the Bond King. "I am a philosophical nomad disguised in Western clothing, a wondering drifter, masquerading in a suit near a California beach," Gross writes. "Sand forms the foundation of my being and its porosity is at once my greatest strength and deepest wound. I have become after 70 years, a man who believes that no belief is sacred." What Gross is currently thinking about, from an investment standpoint, finally becomes sort of clear at the end of his piece. "The real economy needs money printing, yes, but money spending more so, and that must come from the fiscal side – from the dreaded government side – where deficits are anathema and balanced budgets are increasingly in vogue," Gross writes in his second-t0-last sentence. Gross also writes about why central bankers remain so focused on inflation goals, which have been eluding bankers at the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank for the last several years. On the heels of a big week for monetary policy — the US Federal Reserve announced the end of its current QE program and the Bank of Japan announced additional stimulus measures — Gross argues that the only reason central bankers remain so insistent on 2% inflation is because of what the modern global economy has become.  Gross writes that while the US economy flourished in the late 19th century despite deflation, the modern economy isn't based on "investment and innovation" but the "sandy loam of finance." "Inflation," Gross writes, "is required to pay for prior inflation. Deflation is no longer acceptable."  Gross adds: Why not? Simple math, I suppose. Our 2014 U.S. Oldsmobile requires 4% nominal growth just to keep it running, and Euroland economies need at least 3%. Having created outstanding official and shadow banking credit of nearly $100 trillion with an average imbedded interest rate of 4% to 5%, the Fed presses must crank out new credit (nominal growth) of approximately the same 4% to 5% just to pay the interest rate tab. That of course wasn’t the case in Grant’s 19th century version — there was very little debt to service. But now at 500% to 600% of GDP (shadow debt included), it’s a Sisyphean struggle just to stay above water. The conclusion of Gross' first paragraph, however, shows a bit more about what might be interesting Bill Gross in his second act. "I have ideals and moral standards, but I believe them specific to me. Had I inherited your body and ego, 'I' could just as clearly have assumed 'yours.' If so, I wonder, if values are relative, then what are mortals to make of them, and what would a judging God make of us? If a collective humanity is to be rooted in sandy loam, spreading its ideological seeds through howling winds only to root in mutant form at different places and different times, can we judge an individual life?"

The health of the EuroZone’s economy could be the single largest risk to the continuation of the bull market in U.S. equities (with Chinese growth a close second).  There appears to be little in the way of good news in the last week, from poor manufacturing data to woefully under-capitalized banks and a currency that seems dead-set on re-testing 5 year lows. Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve’s impact on the value of the U.S. dollar since the start of QE in 2008, there was a repeated insistence of a strong dollar policy by the central bank.  Interestingly as QE wore on and on, there seemed to be fewer central bankers who could make such claims with a straight face. I think it is safe to say that the new found strength in the U.S. dollar vs the Euro and the Yen is far from a coincidence as the Fed ended QE and the BOJ and the ECB are left to carry the torch.  My friend and emerging market strategist Jay Pelosky, founder of J2Z Advisory which advises institutional investors on global asset allocation and portfolio strategy (who has all the chops to talk all things Macro), has been speaking/writing on the concept of a “lower-for-longer” global growth, most recently on Friday in a piece for Brazilian bank Itau (emphasis mine): While the lower-for-longer growth world becomes accepted wisdom, the investment playbook for such a world seems less clear to many. It makes sense that equities bore the brunt of the recent selloff, given that fixed income and currencies had moved further and faster in discounting a low-growth world with no Fed-driven QE and the natural growth governors of a strong FX and high relative rates. Likewise, it makes sense that US equities rallied on the back of the third-quarter GDP print of 3.5% a day after the Fed stated that rates will remain low for a considerable period of time – the best of both worlds! The good news about the lower-for-longer growth world is that it removes the risk of sharply higher interest rates, which remain the bête noire of financial assets and perhaps economic vitality. It does not preclude the likelihood of some slow, small rate increases at the front end as the Fed tries to build some ammunition for future crises. How investors respond to the potential for small, patient, Fed-led, good rate hikes at the short end, versus bad, sudden, sharp, market-driven rate hikes at the long end, will be important. The risk to the low-growth world is a descent into flatline status ……..Should the global economy weaken sharply, earnings are likely to be affected and thus equities would come into the line of fire. Jay and I are in agreement that the delicate levels of growth, the potentially decreasing positive real growth affects of easy monetary policy, and the recent strength of the dollar pose a great risk to U.S. equities. While it doesn’t seem at all evident at the moment (as the S&amp;P500 is set to make a new all time high on the open, round tripping the nearly 10% decline from Sept 19th) on an ongoing basis, it seems that continued weak global economic data with continued dollar strength WITHOUT a meaningful pick up in the U.S. could be the worst of all outcomes for U.S. stocks.  The strong dollar would be a significant headwind to large U.S. multinational profits in the coming quarters. So expect to see continued levering up by companies to buyback shares at a time when U.S. companies remain hesitant to re-invest for a higher growth world that seems to be on the cusp of a re-set. If we get past the midterms and closer to the holiday season without a hiccup, I suspect that there is little that will derail this train now that the S&amp;P500 is back up nearly 10% on the year. But the higher we go with the U.S. Fed just talking, the greater the risk is in early 2015 of the same sort of sell off we saw in January/February 2014. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA euro logo sculpture stands in front the headquarters of the European Central Bank  in FrankfurtBANGALORE (Reuters) - There is now an even chance the European Central Bank will buy sovereign bonds, according to a Reuters poll of traders taken after the Bank of Japan shocked markets by unexpectedly expanding its already massive asset buying programme. "The move by the BOJ is likely to put more pressure on the ECB to ease policy as well," said one trader at a large dealer. "Both central banks want to boost inflation, and cheapening their currencies by flooding markets through massive asset purchases is one of the ways." Euro zone money market traders gave a median 50 percent chance of ECB sovereign debt purchases, up from 40 percent in a similar Reuters poll on Oct. 13. A majority of those traders said if the ECB does decide on government debt purchases then it is most likely to happen in the first half of 2015. Preliminary data on Friday showed annual inflation in the bloc nudged up to 0.4 percent but by remaining firmly in what the ECB terms the "danger zone" it did nothing to alter expectations that the central bank could still ease policy in coming months. "Things are improving less than what the ECB had hoped for and if they really want to do something then it (sovereign bond purchases) is their last option," added the trader. In an interview posted on CNBC's website on Friday, ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said the bank "never should say never" to full-on quantitative easing, but such a programme is not in sight at the moment. Economists polled by Reuters last week said the ECB will need to expand its balance sheet by around 1 trillion euros for a stimulus programme to be effective in boosting inflation, but the central bank may find it difficult to reach that target. [ECB/INT] Currently the ECB's balance sheet is a little over 2 trillion euros. Apart from buying covered bonds and asset-backed securities the ECB is also providing a new set of loans to banks (TLTROs) which are designed to boost lending. But the take-up at the first tranche was well below market expectations and although the second leg in December is forecast to be better, it may still fall short of the total cash offered. "So far, everything they have done … is all looking as though it's not really working out the way they anticipated," said another trader. The regular survey also showed the ECB will allot 96.5 billion euros at the regular weekly refinancing tender, down from the 118.152 billion euros maturing this week. Banks are expected to repay 4.0 billion euros next week of the long-term loans (LTROs) they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012. This week 3.85 billion euros will be paid back.

APRichard Branson's Virgin America airline announced today in an SEC filing that it is planning to raise up to $368 million in its IPO.  This news comes just days after a fatal crash that killed one Virgin Galactic test pilot and injured another. Virgin Galactic and Virgin America are owned by the same parent company, Virgin Group. Virgin Galactic is the experimental space tourism arm. It's possible that the filing went ahead before the fatal crash on Friday, and the SEC declined the company's request to pull the paperwork. Alternatively, Virgin could be hoping to move past the crash and raise money. Editor's Note: Earlier, there was erroneous reporting that a Virgin Galactic IPO was occurring.

Thomson ReutersWASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending fell for a second straight month in September as investment in both private and public projects declined, suggesting the third-quarter growth estimate could be revised lower. Construction spending dropped 0.4 percent to an annual rate of $950.9 billion, the Commerce Department said on Monday. August's construction outlays were revised to show a 0.5 percent fall instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent decline. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.7 percent. The government last week reported that the economy grew at a 3.5 percent annual pace. Growth in spending on both residential and nonresidential construction were reported to have slowed from April-June's brisk rates. In September, private construction spending dipped 0.1 percent to its lowest level since October last year as an increase in residential outlays was offset by a decline in spending on nonresidential projects. It was the fourth straight month of declines in private constructions spending. Spending on public construction projects fell 1.3 percent in September, with state and local government investment declining 1.4 percent. Spending on construction projects by the federal government slipped 0.3 percent, falling for a third consecutive month.   (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci) FREE AppDownload

The prices paid index fell to 53.5 from 59.5 last month, more than expectations for that index to fall to 58.0. The ISM PMI report also comes after the latest US manufacturing PMI from Markit Economics showed manufacturing activity slowing to its lowest since July.  So, overall, a mixed morning for US manufacturing reports.  From ISM, here's a quick snapshot of what some of the survey's respondents had to say this month.  ISM FREE AppDownload
ShutterstockThis post is sponsored by Lincoln Financial Group.  Investing in an employer-sponsored retirement plan is one of the easiest ways to save for your future.  Many people don't think about how much they should be contributing, or they don't pay attention to how fluctuating markets can affect their portfolio. If you're serious about building your nest egg, there are lots of ways to be smarter about how you add money to your 401(k). Here are some tips you'll want to follow when enrolling in a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan.   1. Contribute. The first thing you need to do is contribute, period — especially if your company offers a match. If you don't, you're literally turning down free money. The most common employer-sponsored plan is a 401(k), in which pre-tax money is deducted from each paycheck based on a percentage you choose, with an annual max of $17,500. If you're lucky, your employer may "match" with its own contribution (typically topped off at 6%). Did we mention that it's free money? If you work for a public education organization, non-profit, or hospital organization, then your retirement plan consists of a 403(b). As with a 401(k), the money is deducted from your paycheck before taxes. Government employees have similar options under a 457(b) plan. 2. Be sure to contribute enough. Contributing a default percentage (on average 3%) simply isn't enough. A bump in your contribution percentage could mean thousands of dollars in retirement income down the road. And while not everyone can afford to max out his or her contributions, you should at least put in enough to get the full match offered by your employer. Put that money to use. 3. Roll over your plan from your previous job. With all the excitement of getting a new job, it's easy to forget (or dread) rolling over your old retirement plan into a new one. But failing to do so could cost you. If left untouched, the funds you've invested in could eventually change or turn into cash by default. Once you're eligible to join your company's retirement plan, it's a good idea to roll over your funds to your new account or open up an IRA account. An IRA account comes with the same tax-deferred benefits as 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) accounts, with lower administrative costs and a wider range of funds to invest in. Talk to a financial adviser to figure out what's best for you. 4. Increase your contribution over time. Early in your career, it's common for your initial contributions to start off low. But as you advance in your career and earn more income, your contributions should take the same trajectory. A 1% to 2% increase each year could make the difference between having enough for retirement and coming up short.  5. Be mindful of your portfolio. Stocks and bonds fluctuate, a lot. "Setting it and forgetting it" isn't a viable savings strategy. Even if you have target-date funds, it's important that you re-evaluate your portfolio periodically — either by yourself or with the help of a financial adviser — to make sure that it reflects changes in the market and that you're not holding onto depreciating funds or missing out on potential gains.  6. Wait until retirement to cash out. While this seems like an obvious piece of advice, a lot of people look at their 401(k) as a reserve fund. It's far better to resist the temptation of touching those funds, and think about saving for the long haul. If not, you can expect to be taxed at your current income tax bracket, as well as pay a 10% penalty fee. Emergencies are bound to happen, but withdrawing funds from your retirement savings account should be an absolute last resort. 7. Resist the temptation to borrow from your plan. Borrowing against your account is far better than cashing out early, but you still face numerous risks. For example, if you have an outstanding loan and quit your job, in many cases you could be forced to pay the loan back immediately. Many accounts don't allow you to continue making contributions while you're paying off an outstanding loan, which means not only are you unable to grow your retirement, but the amount you've borrowed no longer has the potential to grow, either.

LOCUS manufacturing activity is at its lowest level since July.  Markit's US manufacturing PMI reading for October came in at 55.9, missing expectations for the reading to be unchanged from the flash reading of 56.2.  This was expected to be down from a reading of 57.5 in September, though any reading over 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. According to Markit's latest release, "October data highlighted a slowdown in the ongoing U.S. manufacturing sector recovery, with output and new business growth both moderating during the latest survey period. Manufacturers pointed to a weaker contribution from export sales in October, but job creation remained resilient. Meanwhile, input cost inflation was the weakest since April and factory gate charges rose at a slower pace." Job gains October remained close to September's recent peak.  Commenting on the data, Markit senior economist Tim Moore said, "a solid rate of manufacturing job creation was sustained in October, which provides an early indication that domestic labor market conditions have continued to strengthen through the final quarter." Markit's latest US report comes after eurozone manufacturing PMIs earlier this morning showed that overall, manufacturing activity in the economic bloc rose marginally to 50.6 from 50.3.  FREE AppDownload
Spain's manufacturing output is at a 4-month high. That's according to Markit's purchasing managers' index (PMI), a commonly used survey for measuring the strength of a country's business activity, before official figures come out.  The figure stayed at 52.6 for October, the same as in September.  Any figure over 50 indicates that a sector is growing.

Wall Street strategists are more bearish on stocks than they were at the March 2009 lows. So it's time to buy. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 again closed at an all-time high, but according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Sell Side Indicator, Wall Street is signaling that is still time to buy stocks.  BAML's Sell Side Indicator is based on the average recommended equity allocation of Wall Street strategists as of the last business day of each month, and the firm has "found that Wall Street's consensus equity allocation has historically been a reliable contrary indicator." In a note to clients Monday morning, BAML's Savita Subramanian and the equity strategy team at the firm write that "we remain encouraged by Wall Street's ongoing lack of optimism and the fact that strategists are still recommending that investors significantly underweight equities, at 52% vs. a traditional long-term average benchmark weighting of 60-65%." Subramanian writes that when the Indicator has been this low or lower, total returns over the next 12 months have been positive 96% of the time, with median returns of 26%.  Here's the latest chart of the Sell Side Indicator.

Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), Europe's largest sovereign wealth fund, plans to increase its holdings "significantly" in India, according to its chief executive Yngve Slyngstad. Slyngstad told Bloomberg: "India is one of those markets where you should expect that we will continue to increase our investments over time, significantly. "Relative to the size of the economy our investments are smaller than you would expect." "The changes that we have seen [in India] have given us more confidence that we will have good investment potential in the coming years. "We will continue to increase our investments there, both on the fixed-income side and in regards to our company investments." The $860bn (£537bn, €688bn) GPFG has raised its holdings of Indian bonds and stocks to 0.9% of its fixed-income and equities portfolios. India's benchmark S&amp;P BSE share average has surged some 32% this year, on optimism that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's regime can boost growth in Asia's third-largest economy. In October, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said India's $1.9tn economy will grow 5.5% in financial year 2014-15. Since assuming power in May, Modi has shifted toward more market-based energy pricing, which has reduced the country's fuel subsidy bill. His government has permitted more foreign investment in the defense industry and has pushed to stimulate the manufacturing sector. The GPFG holds the surplus wealth generated from Norwegian petroleum income. Oslo generates money for the fund from taxes on oil and gas, ownership of petroleum fields and dividends from its 67% stake in oil major Statoil. FREE AppDownload
It turns out that members of Congress have widely varying financial fortunes. Roll Call publishes an annual list, based on financial disclosure forms, of the net worth of each US representative, delegate, and senator. We mapped this net worth data for each member of the US House of Representatives. Districts in green have House members with positive net worths, and districts in orange and red have members of Congress with a negative net worth (that is, their total debts are greater than their total assets). We have also marked the five richest members of Congress, as well as the five most indebted ones: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Roll Call One remarkable thing about this data is the extreme spread of wealth among members of Congress. Darrell Issa, who had the highest net worth not just in the House but in all of Congress, had a higher net worth than the first 283 House members with positive net worth combined. To see the whole data set, check out Roll Call's post here.

For the first time since Ebola surfaced in Uganda in 1976, an outbreak has exploded beyond rural Africa to reach eight countries, including the U.S. and Spain. For all its notoriety, the most serious Ebola outbreak to date was the one in 2000, and it only infected 425 people. This time around, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) believes 13,743 people have contracted the disease, of whom 5,000 have already died. Due to the painfully slow international response and the lack of effective treatments or vaccines, the disease is now spreading at an exponential rate in West Africa, and the CDC estimates there could be more than 550,000 cases worldwide by the end of January. Global investors have by and large kept their cool thus far, but whether they continue to do so depends on how the epidemic develops from here. The financial costs are already gargantuan. SARS, a viral respiratory disease that killed 744 people between 2002 and 2004 (of  8,000 infected), cost Asian economies about $20 billion. The World Bank estimates Ebola could cost Africa $32.6 billion by the end of 2015. From a business perspective, however, the impact has been limited. ExxonMobil recently delayed an offshore drilling project in Liberia, while highly leveraged London Mining declared bankruptcy earlier this month, citing both falling iron ore prices and difficulty finding a buyer for a Sierra Leone mine due to Ebola panic. In Asia, where memories of SARS are still fresh, airline stocks fell 22 percent between August and late October, despite stable bookings. Credit Suisse biotechnology analysts Jason Kantor and Jeremiah Shepard recently detailed four possible future scenarios for the epidemic. The most likely: Ebola spreads outside the three-country epicenter — Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone — but remains a predominantly African phenomenon, the effect of which will be felt primarily among energy and mining companies. A scarier possibility is the emergence of a second epicenter outside Africa – with the worst-case scenario being an outbreak in a big city or a country with a creaky health care system. Since 64 percent of flights out of the three epicenter countries go to other poor countries, that’s not far-fetched. Energy companies will take a hit if the disease gains traction in Nigeria, which produces 2.3 million barrels of crude oil each year. Cocoa producers and candy companies are nervously watching Cote D’Ivoire, which borders Liberia and produces 30 percent of the world’s cocoa. Traders have bid up cocoa futures to a multi-year high. Previous panics over SARS and H1N1 suggest U.S. shoppers tend to stay home during pandemic scares, hurting retailers. A slowdown in air travel would obviously hurt hotels, but also deal a blow to luxury goods. One-third of luxury items are purchased on trips and airport shopping comprises 5 percent of sector revenues. But what of those companies actually working to fight the disease – from chemical companies that produce disinfectants to the biopharmaceutical companies developing Ebola treatments and vaccines? While six companies are working on Ebola drug candidates, some of which are being used to treat patients on an experimental basis, and five more are focused on potential vaccines, not a single one of them is being produced on a large scale. GlaxoSmithKline and NewLink Genetics Corp. each have vaccines in phase I trials, while a partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bavarian Nordic expects to begin the FDA approval process imminently. All three vaccines have shown efficacy in animals. The best-known Ebola drug, Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s ZMapp, has been tested in seven sick patients, five of whom recovered. Fujifilm’s Avigan has been used to treat several patients in Europe, and a patient in France who took the drug in combination with several others recovered. But positive results from animal research and anecdotal data are just that. Drugs for humans, which can be made at scale, are still out of reach. “We still have a lot to learn about the efficacy and safety of these drugs and vaccines in humans,” says Credit Suisse’s Kantor. Acknowledging the ravages of Ebola – and the need to contain them – the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it will consider approving drugs that show effectiveness in animals. For the time being, Kantor believes that the U.S. government, among others, will likelysign initial procurement contracts with several different companies, renewing if manufacturers prove (a) that the drugs work and (b) that they can reliably produce an adequate supply. The main thing holding back large-scale development of effective treatments and vaccines for Ebola to this point is the fact that the return on investment of doing so – the saving of human lives aside – has been a challenging one for private industry to wrap its head around. For one, there’s no chance of a Lipitor-like success. There is no retail market for such drugs, just as there wasn’t for pandemic flu vaccine in 2009. What’s more, governments and non-governmental organizations are pretty much the only buyers around. And until this summer, Ebola treatments were not high on any cash-strapped governments’ shopping lists. The U.S. government included Ebola in a 2004 law funding the development of treatments for dangerous diseases, for example, but no Ebola drugs were ever added to the U.S. government’s strategic stockpile. Other diseases took precedence – anthrax, because it has been weaponized, and smallpox and pandemic flu due their being more contagious. It’s certainly a priority now. After the initial crisis is over, companies with promising treatments stand to win lucrative procurement contracts from the U.S. government, which buys in bulk for its stockpile, and regularly replaces outdated drugs. Uncle Sam spends $250 million a year buying all the anthrax vaccine a company called Emergent Biosolutions can produce, for example. “Once the government gets into this business, it’s responsible for maintaining what they call ‘warm capacity’,” Kantor says. “Hypothetically, if they want to stockpile 2 million doses of vaccine with the ability to scale to 20 million, they can’t buy the drug once and let the company go bankrupt.” It’s always going to be harder for drug companies to convince themselves of the relative merits of investing in a once-every-fifteen-years virus like Ebola versus funding research into lowering cholesterol levels. But from this point forth, there’s a market for Ebola drugs. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueA woman looks up from her voting booth as U.S. President Barack Obama takes part in early voting at a polling station in Chicago, Illinois October 20, 2014.The Federal Reserve finally put an end to its quantitative easing program on Wednesday in a move that had been widely anticipated for a very long time. Meanwhile, the stock market roared back to record highs. This week brings us a lot of important economic data including the jobs report, auto sales tallies, and manufacturing PMIs. The US will also be holding its midterm elections on Tuesday, which should clear out some more uncertainty for investors. Or it might not. "If we have a really uncertain situation, where the Senate is divided and candidates are threatening recounts, that's really not good," said Newedge's Robbert van Batenburg to Reuters. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Wall Street's equity strategists are more or less telling clients "I toldja so" in the wake of the S&amp;P 500's incredible rebound from October 15 lows. Like we said above, the focus has shifted to the midterm elections. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco argues that the most important policy issue for the stock market is how the US taxes foreign corporate profits. From Bianco's October 9 note: "Most large US multinationals are exasperated by a high US corporate tax rate and especially by taxes imposed on foreign profits when repatriated. The S&amp;P earns 40% of its profits abroad, up from 15% in mid 1990s. US companies cannot compete effectively abroad if they must pay taxes that companies headquartered elsewhere don’t. The slew of inversions, which Treasury recently rushed to impede, is evidence that US politicians don’t understand global businesses. Executives, while plenty patriotic, have a duty to put the company’s future first. Current US corporate tax rules impede globalization and thus growth everywhere. Visibility on a fix is key post election. The US doesn’t build walls to keep in and it shouldn’t tax like a global empire." As far as stock market returns are concerned, there are obviously always a lot of variables to consider. But generally speaking, the stock markets inclination is to go up. "Since World War II, post-midterm election returns have averaged 17.5%, so time appears to be on our side for returns from October 2014 to October 2015," S&amp;P Capital IQ's Sam Stovall said.S&P Capital IQ For more insight about the middle market, visit mid-marketpulse.com.

Virgin GalacticSpaceShiptwo during glide flight. LONDON (Reuters) - The Virgin Galactic spaceship which crashed on Friday was insured against losses totaling around $40-50 million and the lead underwriter was AIG, insurance sources said on Monday. AIG declined to comment. British insurance and brokerage services provider Jardine Lloyd Thompson confirmed that it was the broker on the deal. "We act on behalf of Virgin Galactic and are providing every assistance, as is appropriate in these tragic circumstances," JLT said in a statement. Virgin Galactic is the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson. The spacecraft crashed in California's Mojave Desert during a test flight, killing one pilot and injuring the other. The estimated insured losses are similar to those for the unmanned U.S. supply rocket which exploded last week. But the Virgin Galactic spaceship was insured under an aviation "hull and liability" policy, in contrast to the supply rocket which was insured in the space market, insurance specialists said. The Lloyd's of London [LOL.UL] insurance market plays a key role in aviation insurance, with gross written premium at Lloyd's totaling more than $1 billion in 2013, according to the International Underwriting Association.

Dr. Ed's BlogOf course, one of the most concentrated pools of fools is in Washington, DC. This might explain the extraordinary conclusion of a study examining the performance of the S&amp;P 500 by our long-time statistical consultant Jim Marsten. Along with Joe, he designed many of the publications in the Quant Center on our website. I asked Jim to calculate the three-, six-, and 12-month percentage changes following mid-term elections in the S&amp;P 500. After doing so, Jim concludes: Suppose I told you there is a technical indicator that, once the buy signal was given, has an amazing record--with the S&amp;P 500 up three months later 17 times out of 18 since 1942, up six months later 18 times out of 18, and up 12 months later 18 times out of 18. The only condition this technical indicator has to meet is a particular political-calendar date, i.e., mid-term election day, which happens to be tomorrow. Buying on that day is one of the best technical strategies I have ever seen. One has to go back to Depression-era market losses to find two periods when this indicator did not give consistently positive results. The historical odds are almost 100% in your favor. The average percentage changes are also good since 1942: 8.5% for the three-month periods, 15.0% for six months, and 15.6% for 12 months. Why has this mid-term cycle been so consistently bullish since 1942? The most likely explanation is that mid-term elections tend to increase gridlock in Washington, DC. While the debt-ceiling political crises of August 2011 and late 2012 suggested that too much gridlock is bearish for stocks, it has been quite bullish historically. Jim and I believe that it might be again after tomorrow. It would be bullish to see that our Founding Fathers’ system of checks and balances, designed to limit the folly of our foolhardy politicians, is still working.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Young Americans with big college debts are often portrayed as struggling to pay their bills. The reality is somewhat different - those owing super-sized student loans tend to be higher paid. A Reuters analysis of Federal Reserve data shows that over the past two decades the young with higher incomes have gone from owing less of the debt than the average household to owing considerably more. U.S. student loan balances have quadrupled since 2004 to $1.1 trillion (688.84 billion pounds), prompting credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s and others to express fears the borrowing could crimp consumer spending, especially home buying, and eventually lead to the painful bursting of a bubble. Worries over high loan levels have also been voiced by President Barack Obama and more recently, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Without doubt, many families struggle to pay the rising costs of college, and high levels of unemployment have only added to the distress. Delinquency rates on student loans remain well above historically average levels. But the analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, a triennial survey published in September with 2013 data, makes it clear that heavy borrowing is usually rewarded with big salaries. The increased concentration of debt among the well-paid should ease concerns that the surge in debt is a wider economic threat.    The data show that most of the nation’s overall loan balances are held by those earning more than $60,000. Moreover, among households that owed at least $60,000 and were young, defined as those headed by someone between 20 and 40 years of age, average income last year was $82,000. This includes people like Larry Perrone. His journey into the legal profession started at the private Florida Coastal School of Law in Jacksonville, Florida. He had been working as a bartender and planned to borrow around $130,000, figuring he could make $80,000 a year as a lawyer at a private practice. Perrone did well in his studies, and after a year and a half transferred to the more expensive William &amp; Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Virginia. That meant more borrowing, but potentially a lifetime of higher earnings because his degree would be stamped by a much more prestigious school. "If you're going to get a tattoo, do you go to a really expensive place or to a cheap guy? It wasn't a really difficult decision for me," Perrone said. In 2008 after graduating nearly $200,000 in the red, he took a job at a big firm in Washington, making $160,000 a year. "It worked out well." He initially put off buying a home, but finished paying his loans this year and is now eyeing a condo in Florida. Perrone's story is part of a larger trend in which heavy borrowing is increasingly rewarded with big salaries. Seen another way, as the salaries of the well-educated have grown relative to everyone else over the last quarter century, so has the borrowing that has paid for their training. By last year, the top fifth of total households by income, or those making more than $101,000, was on the hook for roughly a third of student loan balances, nearly twice their share in 1989, according to the Fed survey. At the beginning of the period, student loans were mostly held by middle income families - the next two fifths down the income ladder. But their share fell sharply by 2013 and the share of the bottom two fifths held about steady. The data does not show the income of students’ parents so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the backgrounds of heavy borrowers. The numbers do suggest, however, that worries that America is heading for a debt crisis over student loans are overblown. “There's no bubble here,” said Sandy Baum, a professor of higher education at George Washington University. “People who borrow a lot tend to end up with high paying jobs.” Take Baker Logan, who borrowed about $120,000 to get an engineering degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which data firm Payscale ranks as a top three school for long-term alumni earnings. The average mid-career MIT grad makes $128,800 a year. "MIT has that name, so you immediately get that wow feature when you're talking to employers," Logan said. He graduated this year and is working at a consulting company in Woburn, Massachusetts. Logan, who asked that his current income not be disclosed, expects to pay off his 30-year student loan ahead of schedule. The data also suggests that the more you study, the more you earn, even if it means building up much larger debts. Last year, a young American household with student debt and a main breadwinner with four years of college owed $32,000 and earned about $61,000 on average. The income is a third more than the earnings of a family with just a high school diploma. And the rewards were even higher for young families that have a member who did graduate studies. They owed $55,000 but this came with an income of $99,000 on average. Jason Delisle, an education policy expert at the New America Foundation in Washington, has analyzed government data and estimates that about 40 percent of current U.S. student loan balances were taken out to finance grad school. This, he says, should temper worries about the debt burden's wider impact. "It's almost like the problem goes away," said Delisle, who used to be a senior analyst on the Republican staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. New York Fed via St. Louis FedWhile more Americans go to college and grad school than a generation ago, annual growth in enrollment has slowed since the 1980s and many economists believe this has been a key force in lifting the incomes of the affluent relative to the rest of the country. The theory is that the supply of well-educated workers is falling short of demand in an increasingly high-tech economy, pushing the wages of college grads higher. This makes it easier to pay back money borrowed for increasingly pricy educations. New York Fed researchers said in September that even though college tuition has soared in recent decades, higher wages mean a four-year college grad in 2013 will on average break even on their investment in about 10 years, half the time it took for students who graduated in the 1970s. Rising debt levels nonetheless worry some policymakers, including Yellen. Citing the same Fed survey, she noted in October that for the bottom half of U.S. families by net wealth, student loans balances grew to 58 percent of yearly income in 2013 from 26 percent in 1995. The Obama administration worries that some colleges, particularly private ones, might be overcharging students for degrees that don't lead to good jobs. The impact of the 2007-09 recession has weighed heavily on this group, as it has on those who borrowed for college but dropped out before graduating.Kris Parker graduated with a law degree from Florida Coastal and about $200,000 in debt but has struggled to make enough money to make loan payments. "My credit has been ripped apart," he said. "I can't buy a car. I have a hard time buying furniture." Student loan bills at least three months past due rose sharply after the recession to hit nearly 12 percent in 2012. Delinquencies have fallen steadily since late last year and were last pegged at 10.9 percent between April and June, but that is still nearly twice the average rate between 2003 and 2007. Still, the administration is wary of the view that big student debts are inherently bad. "Rising debt has paid for an increase in the numbers of people able to receive higher education ... and has therefore raised incomes and increased growth," Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin said in September in a speech on student loans and the economy. Raskin cited research by Brookings Institution researchers Matt Chingos and Beth Akers, who found monthly student loan payments have held steady relative to income over the last two decades. "There is a great deal of integrity and stability in the student loan market," Raskin said. For the Brookings researchers - who attribute the stability in debt burdens to lower interest rates, longer payment periods and higher incomes - there are dangers in America's angst over student loans. "Debt is a tool," said Akers. "If anything, I'd want to encourage lower income people to take more advantage of it.”  (Reporting by Jason Lange in Washington; Additional reporting by Rebecca Elliott and Elvina Nawaguna in Washington; Editing by David Chance and Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload

An investigation into the deadly crash of a Virgin Galactic spaceship has found that a function to help the craft descend into the atmosphere was deployed early, a federal safety official said on Sunday, adding pilot error could not be ruled out. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation into what caused the spacecraft to crash in California's Mojave Desert during a test flight on Friday, killing one pilot and badly injuring the other. SpaceShipTwo's rotating tail boom, a key safety feature for re-entering the atmosphere, rotated early, Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the NTSB, said late on Sunday, though he said it was too early to say whether this had caused the crash. Virgin Galactic is the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson. Hart told a news conference that investigators had determined the "feathering" system, which helps it descend into the atmosphere from space, should have been deployed when the vehicle was traveling about 1.4 times the speed of sound. Instead, the feather began rotating when the rocket-powered vehicle was traveling at Mach 1, he said, using a technical term for the speed of sound at a given altitude. Hart said the feathering system, which folds the vehicle in half to create more atmospheric drag, was unlocked early by the copilot, according to video from the spaceship’s cockpit. About two seconds later, the spaceplane’s tail section began to fold. "I'm not stating that this is the cause of the mishap. We have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was," Hart said. Asked if the NTSB was considering the possibility of pilot error, Hart said: "We are not ruling anything out. We are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap … We are looking at a number of possibilities, including that possibility (of pilot error)."  SpaceShipTwo was released normally from its carrier aircraft, WhiteKnightTwo, at an altitude of about 45,000 feet. Shortly afterward its hybrid rocket motor, which was flying for the first time with a new plastic propellant, ignited as planned, Hart said. Investigators also recovered SpaceShipTwo’s propellant tanks and engine intact, indicating there was no explosion. "The engine burn was normal up until the extension of the feathers," Hart told reporters. BBCSpaceShipTwo.SpaceShipTwo was conducting test flights and was not yet certified for commercial operations when the crash occurred, delaying indefinitely the start of passenger service. George Whitesides, the head of the company dedicated to Branson's vision of bringing everyday passengers into space, told the Financial Times the new fuel system used in Virgin'sSpaceShipTwo on Friday had been rigorously tested. Branson and his son plan to fly on the first commercial flight. About 800 people already have paid or put down deposits for the ride, which costs $250,000. On Saturday, Branson vowed to find out what caused his space tourism company's passenger spaceship to crash but expressed a desire to press on with the dream of commercial space flight. The two pilots involved were employees of Scaled Composites, a Northrop Grumman Corpsubsidiary that designed and built the six-passenger, two-pilot craft for Virgin Galactic. Michael Alsbury, 39, has been identified as the copilot who died. Peter Siebold, the 43-year-old pilot riding in the right-hand seat, parachuted to the ground and was recovering at a nearby hospital, Scaled Composites said in a statement. "We owe it to our pilots to find out exactly what went wrong," Branson said in Mojave on Saturday. "If we can overcome it, we will make absolutely certain that the dream lives on." Friday's crash was the second disaster in less than a week suffered by a private space company. On Tuesday, an Antares rocket built and launched by Orbital Sciences Corp exploded after liftoff from Wallops Island, Virginia, destroying a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station. Virgin Galactic is a US offshoot of the London-based Virgin Group founded by Branson, whose empire ranges from airlines to music stores and mobiles phones.  (Editing by Gareth Jones) FREE AppDownload
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Chris Viehbacher speaks plainly. "We had somewhat of a mess in Brazil," he told financial analysts in August 2013, "so that's why I decided to change management." Fifteen months later he has gone the same way as the Brazilian employees he sacked so decisively - fired as chief executive of French drugmaker Sanofi at a dawn board meeting, with the "mess in Brazil" cited as one of the reasons. Investors were stunned, having hitherto seen the affable German-Canadian as one of the best in the business, despite some setbacks and a tough few years for the drugs industry worldwide. The whirlwind week began on Monday Oct. 27 with a leaked letter to the board, dated Sept. 4, in which Viehbacher wrote of rumours of a plot against him at board level and demanded clarity. On Tuesday he presented quarterly results. "We had a conference call and questions were asked about his position but he was being reassuring," said Andrea Williams, European fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. "Then at 8 AM on Wednesday he was gone. There was no opportunity for shareholders to say they did not want him to go." In truth, Viehbacher's downfall was a rather more slow-burn affair. This is the story of how the high-flying former GlaxoSmithKline &lt;gsk.l&gt; executive fell out with members of his board - to a point where they were plotting to replace him, only to find their hand forced by the leaked letter. Viehbacher declined to be interviewed for this article. The other main player in the saga is Serge Weinberg, a stalwart of the French business establishment who joined the board after Viehbacher's 2008 arrival. Weinberg became chairman in 2010, and now has to steer Sanofi until a successor is found. According to the account Weinberg gave to analysts last week, board patience with the style and the substance of the Viehbacher regime was already wearing thin when the CEO was explaining the Brazilian issue back in August 2013. The problem involved local managers overestimating demand, leading to an inventory build-up that ultimately had to be written off. "The execution focus was not sufficient," Weinberg said. "As you probably remember, 2013 was not very satisfying from that point of view." Attempts to reach Weinberg for further explanation were unsuccessful. In the same August presentation, Viehbacher delivered a poor set of second quarter results. Sanofi had undershot investor expectations for the second successive quarter and was cutting its forecasts for the full year 2013. The company would go on to miss forecasts again with its third quarter figures in October, warning a second time on annual earnings.REUTERS/Christian HartmannA logo is seen above entrance at the headquarters of French drugmaker Sanofi in Paris October 30, 2014. Sanofi's board ousted its chief executive of six years on Wednesday, criticising him for an authoritarian management style that was often popular with investors as he lifted the French drugmaker onto the global stage.  On the matter of style, according to a source familiar with the meetings, Viehbacher was warned last year by at least two board members to be more diplomatic in negotiations over French job cuts that were part of a restructuring of the company's research and development operations. His forthright and single-minded style had helped him see through the transformational $20 billion (12.5 billion pounds) takeover of U.S.-based Genzyme in 2011. But it was proving less effective with powerful French unions and a government that was sensitive about unemployment. "Chris's management style was not adequate," Weinberg said on the call with analysts. He stressed that the board's decision to fire Viehbacher had been unanimous. By February 2014, though, there was still no sign outside Sanofi of the rumblings of discontent on its board. Quarterly profits came in above expectations, even though earnings for the full year 2013 were down 9.6 percent. Investors had hoped for more than the 4 to 7 percent earnings growth promised for this year, but they understood that drugmakers worldwide were struggling with patent expiries and cutbacks in healthcare spending by European governments. In the search for growth, Sanofi's focus on diabetes, rare diseases, emerging markets, over-the-counter treatments, animal health and generics seemed to make sense. But Viehbacher wanted to get more out of Sanofi. He set to looking for ways to upgrade the growth profile of its portfolio by jettisoning older drugs - those that will deliver falling revenue over the coming years. Many of those products are made in France, with the inevitable implications for French jobs. According to chairman Weinberg, Viehbacher and the board already knew at this stage about another blow that was to hit the company - a sharp drop in U.S. revenues from its diabetes drug Lantus, which goes off patent in 2015. Investors did not hear about the issue until Tuesday of last week when a wounded CEO presented third quarter 2014 results, just 24 hours before he was fired. Perhaps dismissive of the warnings from board members about the sensitivity of French job cuts, or perhaps mindful of them, Viehbacher decided not to tell his board about the review of its portfolio of older drugs. Then it leaked into the press in the summer. This might have been the tipping point for Weinberg, who cited the issue as an example of Viehbacher's poor communication with the board, and said he had begun discussions about replacing him around that same time. Viehbacher told Reuters just before he was fired that the review had never become an actual project, and so there had been no need to share it. One investor said that might have been unwise. “As CEO, do not try to sell an $8 billion drug portfolio without informing your board, if you want to keep your job!” said Geir Lode, head of Hermes Global Equities. Weinberg also laid the blame for the Lantus problems at Viehbacher's feet. "It was clear in the beginning of the year that we had an issue that needed to be fixed", he said. "It appears that our sales force management on Lantus in the U.S. could have been better. I don't want to elaborate more on this but, clearly, we have not been as good as we should have in managing our sales force on this market." Another issue that surfaced around the same time as the mature products review was Viehbacher's move from Paris to Boston, headquarters of Genzyme, and the heart of the biotech industry. At the time, a spokesman cited family reasons. Sanofi alternates with oil group Total &lt;totf.pa&gt; as France's biggest company by market value, and so the domicile abroad of its CEO made headlines, but only for a few days. On the phone to analysts last week, Weinberg appeared to have difficulty saying whether it was a problem or not: "So, of course, the (Boston move) decision was not an issue. We were informed. We didn't have a discussion on this, we understood the subject, but clearly, from a functional point of view, it has probably made things a little bit more difficult, although it is not a matter that has been counting in the decision that we took." But Viehbacher's relationship with Weinberg was by now bad. "There was a lot of growling," said a source close to the board. There remain plenty of unanswered questions, including why Weinberg thought he could hunt for a replacement for Viehbacher without fear he would find out, how the CEO's bombshell letter stayed secret for almost two months, to what extent performance or personality were the problem, and whether there are other as yet unrevealed issues in the background. For the moment, it looks like mismanagement all round. "They all knew there was disagreement, and yet the whole affair was allowed to reach the market with no plan B in place," said Philippe Soullier, head of management transition consultants Valtus. And the real test for Sanofi, shorn of its CEO of six years, now lies ahead. First of all, Weinberg needs to reassure the all-important executive committee - the team of top bosses that reported directly to Viehbacher. Nine out of 11 of them were appointed under Viehbacher. "The team he put in place may well decide to leave," said Alain Gilbert, co-chairman of medical business strategy consultants Bionest. And Weinberg must also take the stand in Viehbacher's place on Nov. 20 to present the company's R&amp;D day - ironically, being held at the Genzyme headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Viehbacher's new U.S. home. "The strategic direction of the company is now much more uncertain," said Hermes' Lode. "Given the growth challenges faced by the company, especially in the diabetes area, it is now a much harder investment case."  (Additional reporting in Paris by Natalie Huet and Gwenaelle Barzic, and in London by Ben Hirschler and Simon Jessop; Writing by Andrew Callus; editing by Janet McBride) FREE AppDownload
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's official Xinhua news agency on Monday poured cold water on the idea that the leaders of China and Japan could have formal talks on the sidelines of next week's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Expectations have been growing in Japan for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for an ice-breaking chat at the gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders. A meeting of the two leaders would be a symbolic breakthrough in ties between the world's second- and third-biggest economies, which have turned frigid in the past two years over a territorial row, regional rivalry and the bitter legacy of Japan's wartime occupation of China. Abe had "spared no efforts" in seeking to meet with Xi, Xinhua said in an English-language commentary. "His wish will be fulfilled, since Beijing, the host of this forum, will undoubtedly receive the Japanese leader with etiquette and hospitality, despite chronic territorial rows and a historical feud with Tokyo," it said. "However, that does not necessarily mean Abe's long-sought formal talks with Xi during APEC would come true, which demands Abe extend good faith and take real action to create the proper atmosphere." But Japan has not made such efforts in bilateral ties, which have been constantly troubled by its attempts to wash off its war-time atrocities, Xinhua added. Xinhua commentaries are not official government pronouncements, but can be read as a reflection of official thinking. The commentary said that though bad ties benefited neither country, Japan had "launched a string of provocations" last month, including visits by government ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine, which China sees as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Yasukuni honors millions of war dead, including wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal. "In short, it seems nothing more than a mere clumsy political stunt for the island country to advocate dialogue and fence-mending with neighbors on the one hand, while sticking to the bigoted course of fomenting strife and misgivings on the other," Xinhua added.   (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez) FREE AppDownload
The UK's manufacturing PMI is out for October, and at 53.2 it's the highest in three months. The PMI is a survey of manufacturing executives that asks them whether business is looking good or bad. The scale is 0-100, and a 50 rating is neutral, meaning an equal balance between those with positive or negative outlooks. That's well above the neutral 50 mark, but still considerably lower than the very high figures the UK regularly saw when the recovery was emerging, late in 2013 and earlier this year.

We're launching Business Insider UK this week (yay!). As part of the launch, I have the privilege and pleasure of visiting our team in London and talking with many members of the British media. I'm also getting a firsthand look at a part of East London known as the "Silicon Roundabout," where many of the city's tech startups are located. (It's cool! Looks like a cross between Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Berkeley, California. There are universities, cafes, sleek new apartment buildings, street football games, and old "Iron Monger" factories.)   This morning, Simon Jack and the team at the BBC's "Today" program were kind enough to host me for an interview at the BBC's stupendous headquarters in downtown London. Henry Blodget, Business InsiderSimon Jack (right), and the BBC morning hosts The BBC is a remarkable organization. It's the oldest and biggest national broadcasting company in the world. It has 23,000 staff. The building I visited this morning, a gleaming, glass-filled  tower with an open core, houses more than 5,000 journalists producing top-notch journalism across radio, television, and digital. Business InsiderThe BBC headquarters this morning in the rain. Business InsiderOne of the TV newsrooms, viewed through glass in the lobby. Business InsiderThe hollow core and central staircase leading to newsroom after newsroom. The headquarters houses more than 5,000 journalists in all. The BBC would be the envy of any media organization. The size and stability of its budget and relative freedom from commercial concerns (see below) allow it to produce an extraordinary amount of exceptional journalism and programming. But it's also controversial. The BBC is established and largely funded by the British government, as the vast majority of its budget comes from a tax on British television users. Everyone who watches TV in Britain, even those who pull signals out of the air, has to pay a tax of 145 pounds (about $200) a year to fund the BBC. Avoiding this tax is a criminal offense. According to Wikipedia, in 2012, "'more than 204,000 people in the UK were caught watching TV without a licence during the first six months of 2012'. Licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrate courts." Not surprisingly, because of this source of funding, the BBC's very existence is controversial. And the organization is perpetually under intense scrutiny for signs of bias in its reporting. In the United States, where many citizens reflexively hate the government and taxes of all kinds, and where most media organizations (including the small and modestly subsidized National Public Radio) are viewed by some conservatives as liberal propaganda networks, the existence of the BBC would be almost unfathomable.

Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the world's biggest advertising agency holding group WPP, has reacted quickly to the news this Monday morning that rival Publicis Groupe is acquiring digital advertising company Sapient for $3.7 billion. He told Business Insider: "It looks like the behavior of a jilted lover. Christmas came early for Sapient shareholders." Sorrell is referring to Publicis' failed $35 billion merger with Omnicom, which was due to create the world's largest advertising group, overtaking WPP, but collapsed in May this year. Last month on Publicis Groupe's Q3 earnings call, the company's chief executive Maurice Levy admitted his company's poor results in the quarter were his fault for being distracted by the doomed Omnicom merger. He also admitted Publicis was the more interested party in the plans than Omnicom, a company he said was more keen on a takeover than a merger. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersMaurice Levy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Publicis Groupe, attends the company's 2013 annual results presentation in ParisBy Leila Abboud PARIS (Reuters) - Publicis , the world's third-largest advertising holding company, has agreed to buy digital ad specialist Sapient for $3.7 billion in cash as it seeks to accelerate growth after a botched merger earlier this year. Publicis said on Monday that the deal values U.S.-based Sapient at $25.00 per share, which represented a 44 percent premium to Friday's close. For Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy, the deal is part of a push to revitalize the group at a time when its quarterly top-line growth has lagged rivals WPP  and Interpublic  among others. Levy has blamed the poor performance on the hangover from Publicis' failed "merger of equals" with world number 2 ad agency Omnicom , which was announced in August 2013 and abandoned in May over control and cultural clashes. Levy is betting that Sapient, which earned 63 percent of 2013 sales in the healthy ad market of North America, will help Publicis get back on its feet. "It will give Publicis access to new markets and create new revenue streams," said the veteran CEO in a statement. Publicis did not say when the Sapient acquisition would add to group profits but expects 50 million euros in annual cost savings from the combination. Publicis' management and supervisory boards unanimously backed the deal, as did the board of Sapient, which will recommend shareholders tender their shares. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Citigroup  has committed to financing the bid. Sapient boss Alan Herrick will continue to run the company and is to join Publicis' management team, while Jerry Greenberg, the current co-chairman of Sapient's board will become a board member of Publicis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in nine months in October as a cooling property sector weighed on demand, a survey showed on Monday, adding to signs of fragility in the world's second-largest economy. The services sector has been more resilient than the manufacturing sector and is creating more jobs, which partly explains why the government has so far refrained from more aggressive policy easing in supporting the slowing economy. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.8 in October from September's 54.0, which was the weakest reading since January, the National Bureau of Statistics said. But it was still comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. The sub-index of new orders inched up to 51.0 in October from September's 49.5, which was the lowest since December 2008. "Sub-indices for sectors such as railway transport and real estate remained below the 50 point and market demand weakened," the bureau said. The sub-index measuring employment fell to 48.9 in October - the fourth straight month when it was below 50, and was down from September's 49.5. An official survey published on Saturday showed China's factory activity unexpectedly fell to a five-month low in October as firms fought slowing orders and rising costs in the cooling economy, reinforcing views that the country's growth outlook is hazy at best. China's annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, even as the government rolled out more stimulus measures to avert a sharper slowdown. The two surveys suggest a further loss of economic momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Analysts had already expected full-year economic growth to miss the government's full-year target of around 7.5 percent, even after it rolled out a series of support measures. Still, top policymakers have issued a steady stream of reassurances about the economy in recent weeks, citing among other things a strong services sector and a still resilient labor market. Policy measures so far this year include accelerated construction of railway and public housing projects, cuts in reserve requirements (RRR) for some banks and loosening of restrictions on property purchases to support the cooling housing market. The services sector made up 46.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, surpassing the secondary sector – manufacturing and construction – for the first time, as the government aims to create more jobs and boost domestic consumption.
