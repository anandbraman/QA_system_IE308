Tareq Salahuddin In markets, the "pain trade" is when some asset goes in a direction that causes the most pain to the most amount of people. In a note to clients this evening, Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading dubbed falling Treasuries (and therefore surging yields) the new pain trade: Much of the pain trade talk over the past two years has been the move higher in equities.† These days, there is a new pain trade--being long bonds. There is a major tidal shift occurring here.† Following 5 years of the Federal Reserve, Commercial Banks and investors piling into bonds the momentum is finally reversing.†††† Normally, we would take the view that investors should not be scared of a 10 year Treasury yield below 3%. The problem is that the behavior of the buyers of these instruments over the past few years has hardly been normal.† He goes on to note how EVERYONE has piled hard into Treasuries since the crisis. Obviously one big buyer has been the Federal Reserve (though as it prints money, losses don't mean much to it). On the other hand, banks and retail investors have bought gobs of safe fixed income products in recent years. This chart shows equity vs. fixed income fund flows since 2007. The divergence is epic. BTIG This one shows how commercial banks have loaded up the boat. JonesTrading The surge in interest rates in the US is the big story. From a purely trading standpoint, O'Rourke is dead on that this is catching a lot of folks with their pants down. This tweet from PIMCO today ó whose bond funds have been getting rocked in the Treasury selloff ó was quite startling to see. Gross: 1 to 2 month performance numbers are a blip on a 40-year performance history. PIMCO marches on a long-term path.

Brendan Arthur Ring at www.flickr.comLast week was super-busy, and it ended in dramatic fashion, with a strong jobs report and a major market rally. This week should be quieter, but there are some big stories coming up. SocGen's Kit Juckes has the quick preview: The weekend has been dominated by sport and weather. Four issues stand out for the week ahead: Ben Bernanke's speech on Wednesday, the UK fall-out from the MPC; China's teetering economy; and the possibility of a scotch-tape solution to Portugal's economic crisis.¬† Ben has a chance of putting a cap on Treasury yields. He must be feeling like the cat who got the cream, with equities holding up while the air comes out of the carry-bubble and Treasuries normalise. But he's also a very cautious and dovish man. I reckon he will try and perhaps even succeed to calm things down. If it weren't for the dramatic spike in rates, then everything would look perfect right now for the Fed. But rising interest rates will matter (or at least seem likely to), at least on the housing recovery front. Not only are US rates spiking, but the spike comes at a time when both the ECB and the Bank of England are talking about commitments to keep rates low in the future, so the US yield spike sticks out like a sore thumb.
APNEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock of U.S. insurer UnitedHealth Group could rise 40 percent over the next two years as Obamacare is fully rolled out, business weekly Barron's said in its July 8 edition. "Its Optum business will help drive down costs for its health plans, giving it a competitive edge," Barron's wrote. UnitedHealth Group is set to report second-quarter earnings on July 18. The price of UnitedHealth Group's stock is up 22 percent for the year to date. The stock hit a 52-week intraday high of $66.36 on July 1, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Friday, the stock closed at $66.17. (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Jan Paschal) Copyright (2013) Thomson Reuters. Click for restrictions 
There are five main characteristics of the global investment climate: 1) the Federal Reserve has begun a protracted exit from the extraordinary monetary policy; while 2) other major central banks are not ready to follow suit. ¬†This is encouraging 3) an unwind of structural positions, that were predicated on low US interest rates, and 4) the replacement of the dollar as funding currency, which is leading to 5) portfolio adjustments away from fixed income, emerging markets and some commodities, including precious metals. ¬† ¬†The dollar, US and Japanese equities are favored by investors. The end of the US payroll tax holiday and the sequester, while Europe relaxes its austerity drive in de jure as well as de facto meant that US fiscal policy was the tighter. ¬†Now the Federal Reserve has signaled that barring new signs of weakness in the economy, it will likely slow its asset purchases this year and conclude them next year.¬† A Reuters poll after the stronger than expected jobs report included 17 of the 21 primary dealers. ¬†Eleven now look for the tapering to being in September, up from 7 in late June. ¬†The poll found the median expectation that the first slowdown in purchases is $20 bln. ¬†Most Primary dealers expect the first hike in the Fed funds rate in 2015, but the Fed funds futures strip suggests the market is discounting a move in late 2014. ¬† Fed officials appear somewhat surprised by the sharpness of the rise in interest rates and have tried to allay fears that tapering is tightening. ¬†This warns that the FOMC minutes that will be released on Wednesday will likely be more hawkish than the subsequent soothing rhetoric. ¬†The market will scrutinize Bernanke's speech the same day and Plosser, Bollard and Willams comments on Friday for clues into Fed thinking.¬† The US earnings season kicks off with Alcoa on Monday. ¬†According to Thomson Reuters, the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements appears to be the largest since 2001. ¬†This lowers the bar of expectations, which makes positive surprises more likely. ¬†At the same time, the US Treasury will sell $64 bln worth of securities, starting Tuesday. ¬† The euro area economy has contracted for six consecutive quarters through Q1 13, and recent data suggest the pace may be lessening. ¬†Industrial production figures due this week will likely support the view. ¬†However, the unexpected weakness in industrial orders (-1.3% v 1.2% consensus), following a 2.2% decline in April warns of downside risks for Germany industrial output. ¬†Recall the June manufacturing PMI slipped to 48.8 from 49.4 and has not been above the 50 boom/bust level since February. ¬† Politics may trump economics in the euro area. ¬†Greece's next tranche payment is front and center. The Eurogroup meets on Monday and will likely sanction a compromise worked out over the weekend. The easing of the acute phase of the crisis has not alleviated the need to reach a compromise. Moreover, the rearguard action to minimize the impact of the backing up of US rates on Europe, will prove for naught if there is a renewed crisis in periphery.¬† It is also understandable why Germany would prefer an uneventful few months in the run-up to its election. ¬†Circumstances may be favorable for this. ¬†The risk that Portugal's government will collapse has receded with a new compromise between the coalition partners, making S&amp;P's cut of Portugal's credit outlook to negative from stable due to "growing political uncertainties" ahead of the weekend look rushed. ¬†There may be near-term scope for Portuguese stocks and bonds to outperform others as the situation normalizes. The Italian government's willingness to delay the VAT hike also appears to buy time for the grand coalition. Japan reports its May current account balance on early Monday in Tokyo. ¬† The reason it is in surplus is not because of the trade account, which remains deeply negative, but because of its investment income balance. ¬†However, exports are recovering and the 10.1% year-over-year rise in May's merchandise exports (reported in mid-June) is the fastest pace since December 2010. ¬†  The Bank of Japan is the only major central bank to meet in the week ahead. ¬† It is highly unlikely that there will be change in policy, but the BOJ is expected to upgrade its economic assessment. ¬†Japan appears to enjoy the fastest growth among the G7 in Q2. In terms of portfolio flows, Japanese investors continue to liquidate their foreign bond and stock holdings on a net basis. ¬†Foreign investors, for their part, not only were not shaken by the recent 20% slide in the Nikkei, but appear to have resumed their purchases. Through last week, the Australian dollar has depreciated by 12.8% this year, second only to the 14.2% decline of the Japanese yen, among major currencies. ¬†The RBA is not satisfied yet and further currency depreciation is anticipated. ¬†Two pieces of data, employment data due on July 11 in Sydney and the inflation data on July 23, will likely solidify expectations for an August rate cut. ¬†In five of the seven months through May, Australia has lost jobs. ¬† The Bloomberg consensus calls for a flat report, but a tick up in the unemployment rate to 5.6%. ¬† China's money markets have nearly normalized after the squeeze last month. ¬†However, the underlying issues do not appear to have been addressed. ¬†In fact, the higher interest rates appear to have attracted even more funds into the wealth management products that have an inherent maturity mismatch (investors get long-term interest rates in a short term investment product). ¬†Press reports suggest that a record number of investment plans were sold by 70 banks over the past two weeks, a 50% increase from the previous two week period. China's Minsheng Banking Corp, China's first privately owned lender, for example, sold a 35-day wealth management product with a annualized yield of 7%, according to reports. ¬† Separately, China is expected to report inflation and trade figures in the week ahead. ¬†Inflation is expected to have ticked up, helped by a rise in pork prices. ¬† Headline CPI has been fairly steady in the 2.2%-2.4% range (3, 6 and 12 month averages), but the consensus calls for a 2.5% reading in June. ¬† China is also expected to report its June trade figures near mid-week. ¬†It surplus is expected to rise from $20.4 bln to $27.8 bln. ¬†Export growth is expected to have accelerated after a 1% increase (year-over-year) in May. ¬†Imports had unexpectedly fallen in May, but are expected to have rebounded smartly in June (6.2% vs -0.3%). ¬† This may lend some support to the numerous countries for whom China is their top export destination. ¬† The Chinese yuan appreciated about 1.9% against the US dollar from late February through late May. ¬†The dollar has stabilized in a CNY6.12-CNY6.15 range. ¬†Given the dollar's broad based strength, it should not be surprising to see the dollar rise toward the upper end of this range in the days ahead. ¬† There is host of central banks from emerging markets that meet in the week ahead. ¬†Only two, Indonesia and Brazil are expected to hike rates. ¬†The others, including Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, Chile and Mexico are expected to stand pat. ¬†A 25 bp increase in key rates is expected by Indonesia's central bank. ¬†A 50 bp hike by Brazil is widely expected, though there is some speculation of a larger move. ¬† Read more posts on Marc to Market ¬ª
"If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear. In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1% unemployment rate that prevailed when the committee announced this program." The first graph is for GDP. The current forecast is for GDP to increase between 2.3% and 2.6% from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013. The first quarter was below the FOMC projections (red),†and it appears the second quarter will also be below the FOMC forecast - if so, then GDP will have to pickup in the 2nd half of 2013 for the Fed to start tapering QE3 purchases†in December. Calculated Risk The second graph is for the unemployment rate. The current forecast is for the unemployment rate to decline to 7.2% to 7.3% in Q4 2013. We†now have data through Q2, and†so far the unemployment rate is tracking at the†high end of†the forecast.† If the participation rate ends the year at 63.6% (level†for the year),†then job growth will have to pickup up a little in the 2nd half†to meet the FOMC projections.† See the Atlanta Fed's Jobs Calculator tool to estimate how many jobs per month will be needed to reach a certain unemployment level. Calculated Risk The third graph is for PCE prices. The current forecast is for prices to increase 0.8% to 1.2% from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013. We only have data through May, but so far PCE prices are below this projection - and this projection is significantly below the FOMC target of 2%. Clearly the FOMC expects inflation to pickup, and a key is if the recent decline in inflation is "transitory". Calculated Risk The fourth graph is for core PCE prices. The current forecast is for core prices to increase 1.2% to 1.3% from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013. Once again we only have data through May, but so far core PCE prices are below this projection - and, once again, this projection is significantly below the FOMC target of 2%. Clearly the FOMC expects core inflation to pickup too. Calculated Risk It has only†been just over two weeks since the FOMC press conference, and all of the data has been worse than the FOMC forecasts (GDP revised down, unemployment rate at high end, prices below forecast).††It would†be a stretch to say the incoming data has been "broadly inconsistent" with the June FOMC projections, but clearly the economy will have to pickup before the FOMC would meet their "broadly consistent" goal and start to taper QE3 purchases in December. (September tapering seems less likely now since the key data has been worse than forecast, but still not impossible).
Iran cuts value of local currency in half for most importers, in bid to lure investorsTEHRAN, Iran (AP) ‚Äî Iran's central bank is allowing most importers to buy local currency at half the former official price as part of attempts to attract investors to an economy battered by Western sanctions. The effective devaluation of the Iranian rial comes as other proposals are being floated to boost commerce, including possibly waiving taxes for foreign companies. Sanctions over Iran's nuclear program have hit the country's vital oil exports and blocked transactions on international banking networks. Inflation is running at more than 25 percent. The central bank offered most importers an exchange rate of 24,779 rials for $1 on Sunday, a day after the official announcement. That compares with the previous government-set rate of 12,260 rials. The unofficial street rate, however, remains considerably higher, at about 33,000 rials per U.S. dollar. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The government of Iceland does not have the necessary skills to manage its own currency. It should ditch the Icelandic krona and adopt Bitcoin, a nascent virtual currency that so far looks like the preserve of speculators, internet geeks, money launderers and illicit online gamblers. That was the incendiary view being championed by an angel investor called Sveinn Valfells last week, as investors, computer programmers and users of the online currency gathered at Canary Wharf to attend the Bitcoin London conference. Despite the unorthodoxy of Valfells' points, he was actually making his argument from a position of some kind of strength in that he is a) Icelandic, and b) comes from a family with a history of running unofficial currencies. "My grandfather co-founded a construction company in 1947 called Steypustodin ‚Äì "the ready-mix factory" ‚Äì and my father and his cousins were running the company in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of double-digit, and then triple-digit, inflation," he said. "In Iceland, people liked to build their own houses at the time, but they couldn't put the money they were saving to build their homes into the bank, because it disappeared. Somebody had the idea to buy certificates in building materials in advance, and those certificates were denominated in cubic meters of concrete. "It became very popular on payday, and our company would issue the certificates. One day the company got a call from the inland revenue asking if we had issued these vouchers. We confirmed it, but asked why they wanted to know. The official said somebody was trying to use the vouchers to pay his taxes." That the Icelandic revenue eventually accepted the vouchers shows, Valfells argued, that there are moments in history when people are keen to try out innovative alternative currencies. This fascinating view was aired during a week in which the Bitcoin currency started to attract more mainstream publicity, with support from a pair of high- profile backers. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the former Olympic rowing twins who famously alleged that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg stole their website idea, revealed plans to float an investment fund based on the digital currency. Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would, they said, initially sell $20m of shares, with each share worth a fraction of a Bitcoin. The shares are aimed at investors looking for a "cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins", according to a filing with US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The twins' move comes after plenty of people have made (and lost) virtual Bitcoin fortunes in an extremely volatile market. The value of a Bitcoin at the start of 2013 was $13; it rose to a peak of $266 in April before slipping back to below $80 last week. City sources say major financial institutions have started hiring researchers to analyze the market, the theory being that if the price rises above $400, Bitcoins will have become valuable enough for them to plough money into. Others, however, feel that will create an even bigger bubble, and potentially undermine the embryo of a decent idea. Professor Jon Rushman, of Warwick Business School, says: "It is not going to help Bitcoin's quest for respectability to have associations with such thoroughbred vulture capitalists [as the Winklevoss twins]. The less people think of Bitcoin as a 'get rich quick' investment, the better its chances of survival. It needs publicity for its qualities as a neutral and universally accessible currency with a transparent exchange rate and immunity from central bank manipulation." Certainly, Bitcoin's future as a serious currency was of more interest to the techies at last Tuesday's conference, albeit as part of a series of presentations that made the whole scheme feel like it is still an academic debating point. So what is the fuss about? Bitcoins are a form of electronic money that was created by an unknown developer (or developers) in 2008 as a peer-to-peer currency, traded through online exchanges. They are not managed or traded by any company or government, and their release is tightly controlled by software running a set of algorithms. You can currently spend them only with niche merchants online, but there are obvious potential benefits in using Bitcoins for international transactions. Supporters also argue that they're a safer solution for online shopping, being cheaper and less open to fraud than credit cards. But if you asked delegates at last week's conference why you might want to use Bitcoins instead of pounds, euros or dollars, the only convincing reason they can provide is that the anonymity the currency provides makes it easier to launder money, buy illegal drugs, and consume hardcore porn (or indulge in a combination of all three). "They are very nerdy products," said Michael Jackson, a former chief operating officer of internet communications firm Skype and now a partner at Mangrove Capital Partners. "It is difficult to do this stuff unless you have a degree in computer science. That's no good. We have not seen anything interesting [to invest in involving Bitcoin]." Jackson's views were largely echoed by other technology investors at the conference. Stefan Gl√§nzer, who co-founded online auction site Ricardo and, more recently, Passion Capital, admitted he had yet to buy his first Bitcoin. Had attending the Bitcoin conference persuaded him to make a purchase? "First, I have to understand exactly what you have to do before you buy one." Taavet Hinrikus, another former Skype executive and the founder of online currency exchange Transferwise (which does not deal in Bitcoin) was more positive. "For the average person, there is no reason to have a Bitcoin," he said. "But most people tend to moan about their experience of the payments industry: if this brings about change, that would be awesome. Bitcoin may not survive, but it could be like [early online music service] Napster in that it highlights problems, then something else comes along. In music, now we have Spotify." So maybe Valfells is right and there will be serious virtual currencies operating in the future. And maybe one of them will be Bitcoin. Or maybe not. After all, those 1980s concrete certificates are not as popular as they once were. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
The Italian government is out of money. Not that the US government is in any better shape in that respect, or the Japanese government for that matter, but they have central banks that print the missing moolah with lavish abandon. Italy doesn't. It has the ECB which is run by an Italian who promised last year to print with lavish abandon to keep countries like Italy afloat. But that promise is not the same thing as having your own central bank. On July 4, Italy's budget fiasco came to light once again. Wracked by the pretense of austerity, expenditures rose 1.3% in the first quarter, while revenues remained flat. So the deficit rose to 7.3% of GDP, up from 6.6% last year, bringing the national debt to 130% of GDP. Ballooning debt and deficits in a shriveling economy ‚Äì Italy has been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2011 ‚Äì is a toxic combination in the Eurozone. How will Italy force its deficit under 3% of GDP, the line in the sand that would trigger the Eurozone‚Äôs excessive deficit procedure? The government is desperately trying. Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni announced that he‚Äôd identified a1,600 ‚Äúunused‚Äù properties that could be dumped. In the near term, this could haul in about ‚Ç¨600 million, he said, though former Prime Minister Mario Monti's plan to do that had run aground on the reefs of the declining property market. In any case, despite appearances to the contrary, "the trend of public finances in the first half is consistent with the achievement of a net deficit of 2.9%," he said. But ‚Ç¨600 million, if they materialize, would be a drop in the rusty Italian budget bucket. Much more would be needed. Hence, a eurocratic deus ex machina: Jos√© Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, told the European Parliament on Wednesday that the budget rules would be reinterpreted for 2014 so that some public spending on infrastructure projects could be excluded from the deficit figures ‚Äì something Italy has long pushed for in its valiant efforts to keep its deficit under 3%. If all else fails, monkey with the rules. Abracadabra. ‚ÄúFor countries with high levels of public debt,‚Äù such as Italy, ‚Äúthis will be of limited use in the short term,‚Äù an EU official cautioned to appease any remaining Germanic deficit hawks. But these kinds of details didn't stop Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta from declaring victory. ‚ÄúWe made it!‚Äù he tweeted triumphantly. It would give ‚Äúmore flexibility in coming budgets for countries like Italy‚Äù that had their ‚Äúaccounts in order.‚Äù What exactly he meant with ‚Äúaccounts in order,‚Äù given Italy‚Äôs deficit and debt spiral, remains a mystery ‚Äì particularly in light of the fact that it cannot even pay its past-due bills. Beppe Grillo, leader of the opposition 5-Star Movement, has long hammered on this point. In April, during the post-election interregnum, he‚Äôd clamored for ‚Äúthe immediate payment of about ‚Ç¨120 billion‚Äù that the government and public entities owed the private sector. The government‚Äôs refusal to pay its suppliers violates EU rules. But the EU has soft-pedaled the issue, for two very big reasons: payment of arrears would force Italy to sell a truckload of bonds when there might not be any demand; and it would push the deficit way beyond the 3% line in the sand. Thanks to cash accounting, only actual disbursements make it into the deficit figure. Italy has achieved its ‚Äúausterity‚Äù goals by not paying its suppliers. Once again, abracadabra. But it‚Äôs strangling businesses. So, paying a portion of those past-dues, namely ‚Ç¨40 billion, has been kicked around. Most recently, Renato Brunetta, leader of the House and member of Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs PDL party, demanded at a coalition meeting that payment be made by the end of the year. In a surrealist show of noble governance, Letta himself jumped into the fray and committed to pay those debts even faster ‚Äì not in July or August, but sometime in the fall! Rousing applause! "I would love to" pay the past-due debt of the Public Administration by 2013, "but I don‚Äôt know if it can be done," retorted Economic Development Minister Flavio Zanonato the next morning. "It's not ill will, but there is a technical problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe government has removed the obstacle; now all the various sources of expenditure must take action to pay." They don‚Äôt have the money, apparently. To say that it‚Äôs difficult to pay the debts of the Public Administration is "obvious and true," he conceded. It would normally be an admission of default. But not for the Italian government. For them, it‚Äôs just another illustration of a budget absurdity: staying by hook or crook on this side of the 3% line in the sand ‚Äì even if it strangles companies and the economy and makes the deficit and debt spiral worse. Italy has become legendary about tax evasion, which is part of its budget absurdity. So now the G-8 wants to crack down. The first four items at the recent meeting dealt with the need for governments to share information to ‚Äúfight the scourge of tax evasion.‚Äù If only their primary targets were multinationals, banks, and hedge funds. But they‚Äôre going after the little guy. Read.... Beware, the Borderless Taxman¬†Cometh
REUTERS/Bobby YipAs gold prices plunged, gold mining stocks have taken a beating too. We saw a brutal sell-off on Friday, and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF has been down 49.5% year-to-date. In the second of our two-part interview with Jim Rogers, the commodities guru told¬† us about the biggest headwinds for gold miners. Also, he's not convinced that the commodities supercycle has ended just yet.  Business Insider: What's next for gold miners and mining stocks? Jim Rogers: I don't own gold mining stocks. There's so many other easy ways for people to buy gold now that the miners have stiff competition. And there's lots and lots of competitive situations in mining. 30 years ago if you wanted to buy gold, you were almost restricted to gold mining shares. That's not true anymore. You can buy all sorts of coins. In those days only Krugerrands were available, 30 years ago. Nobody even made gold coins except Krugerrands. Now many countries have them. [There's] All sorts of ETFs, ETNs, futures, now there's many ways to buy gold. So the miners have a serious competitive situation and of course there's hundreds of them. Mark Twain said the definition of a gold mine is 'a hole in the ground with a liar standing at the top of the hole,' because there's just so many of them. Somebody once did a study, and I think he determined that more money has been lost in gold mining shares than any other industry in America, including airlines and railroads at one time. So miners are going to have a very difficult time ahead of them. If I'm right about the price of gold, that's one huge headwind and the other is there's too many of them. If you can find a gold mine that can make money, that has good management and that has good reserves, sure. But even that's going to be difficult because gold is going to take a while to make a bottom. BI: The price of gold is now below the cost of production for many mines. Do you think that could cause tightness in supply and push prices higher? JR: Of course that would happen eventually. I've been in the investment world a long time and I know that things can stay below the cost of production for years. It takes a long time for people to believe they have to close their mines. It costs money to close a mine, it costs money to re-open a mine, so people are reluctant to close mines. So you can see any commodity staying below the cost of production for a while, especially if it's something like a mine which is expensive to close, and expensive to open. Some people are not going to be able to open mines because of what's happened.¬† But then you're going to eventually have people close mines, and eventually, like I said it's going to work its way out in 2014, 2015, gold will make a nice bottom and off we'll go again with the assumption of a bull market. BI: The word on Wall Street is that the commodities super cycle is now over. Do you subscribe to that view? JR: Well I'm very keen to hear that, especially since none of these people saw the bull market coming. All those people who didn't see it coming and weren't convinced it was happening, are now saying it's all over. I'm sure you know that bull markets climb a wall of worry and we're certainly having a wall of worry and skepticism which is good. In 1987 stocks around the globe fell 40% and many people said the bull market was over. Then in 1989, 1990, 1994, 1997, 1998 there were many times when stocks collapsed and everybody was convinced the bull market was over. The bull market wasn't over. It eventually ended in a bubble. In my view that's happening with commodities. I don't see major sources of new supply coming in on stream. Most commodities don't have massive new supply yet. For instance, agriculture has produced record levels for the past few years and yet inventories are the lowest in 40 years because consumption keeps going higher and higher, faster than production does. We have serious fundamental problems developing in agriculture. I don't see enough new supply to cause the bull market to end other than a temporary consolidation, especially since so many people are convinced and quick to rush out and write that the bull market is over. But we'll see. Most bull markets have lasted for a couple of decades, or nearly a couple of decades. And in my view supply is not there yet. By the way if economies slow down, it would affect demand for all commodities but then Mr. Bernanke and his friends are going to print a lot more money. It's the wrong thing to do but unfortunately that's all they know to do, and they'll do more.
For example, if we want less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we should tax carbon polluters. On the other hand, if we want more students from lower-income families to be able to afford college, we shouldn‚Äôt put a tax on student loans. Sounds pretty simple, doesn‚Äôt it? Unfortunately, congressional Republicans are intent on doing exactly the opposite.Earlier this year the Republican-led House passed a bill pegging student-loan interest rates to the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, plus 2.5 percentage points. ‚ÄúI have very little tolerance for people who tell me that they graduate with $200,000 of debt or even $80,000 of debt because there‚Äôs no reason for that,‚Äù Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the co-sponsor of the GOP bill,¬†said.Republicans estimate this will bring in around¬†$3.7 billion¬†of extra revenue, which will help pay down the federal debt.¬†In other words, it‚Äôs a tax ‚Äî and one that hits lower-income students and their families. Which is why several leading Democrats, including Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, oppose it. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make sure we don‚Äôt charge so much in interest that the students are actually paying a tax to reduce the deficit,‚Äù heargues.(Republicans claim the President‚Äôs plan is almost the same as their own. Not true. Obama‚Äôs plan would lead to lower rates, limit repayments to 10 percent of a borrower‚Äôs discretionary income, and fix the rate for the life of the loan.)Meanwhile, a growing number of Republicans have signed a pledge ‚Äì sponsored by the multi-billionaire Koch brothers ‚Äî to oppose any climate-change legislation that might raise government revenues by taxing polluters. Officially known as the ‚ÄúNo Climate Tax Pledge,‚Äù its signers promise to ‚Äúoppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.‚ÄùBy now 411 current office holders nationwide have signed on, including the entire GOP House leadership, a third of the members of the House as a whole, and a quarter of U.S. senators.The New Yorker‚Äôs Jane Mayer¬†reports¬†that¬†two successive efforts to control greenhouse-gas emissions by implementing cap-and-trade energy bills have died in the Senate, the latter specifically targeted by A.F.P.‚Äôs pledge Why are Republicans willing to impose a tax on students and not on polluters? Don‚Äôt look for high principle.Big private banks stand to make a bundle on student loans if rates on government loans are raised. They have thrown their money at both parties but been particularly generous to the GOP. A 2012 report by the nonpartisan Public Campaign shows that since 2000, the student loan industry has spent more than$50 million¬†on lobbying.Meanwhile, the Koch brothers ‚Äì whose companies are amongAmerica‚Äôs 20 worst air-polluters¬†‚Äìhave long been intent on blocking a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.

Jose Luis Magaua / Reuters/Reuters AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - The U.S. federal budget cuts are an inappropriate measure that will weigh on potential growth, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said on Sunday, urging Washington to present "credible" fiscal plans. Washington enacted across-the-board federal government spending cuts, known as sequestration, in March because Congress could not agree on an alternative. It has meant everything from furloughs for air traffic controllers to fewer planes for the U.S. Navy to smaller subsidies for farmers. "The budgetary procedure that is in place in the United States, which leads to a budgetary adjustment, seems to us absolutely inappropriate ... because it blindly affects certain expenditures that are essential to support medium and long term growth," Lagarde told an economists' conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. Her comments echoed those last month from the IMF itself, which said: "The deficit reduction in 2013 has been excessively rapid and ill-designed." In its annual check of the health of the U.S. economy, the IMF forecast economic growth would be a sluggish 1.9 percent this year. The IMF reckons growth would be as much as 1.75 percentage points higher if not for the rush to cut the government's budget deficit. While the budget cuts that took hold on March 1 do not appear to be hitting government payrolls directly so far, some economists said they were weighing on private employers and helped explained a sharp slowdown in hiring in the health care and social assistance sector. Lagarde urged Washington - as well as Tokyo - to come up with fresh plans to cut their debt. Japan has pledged to halve the primary deficit - the budget excluding new bond sales and debt servicing - by March 2016 and bring it to surplus by March 2021 to contain its ballooning public debt. It will detail how it wants to accomplish that in a medium-term fiscal plan expected in August. "It is indispensable that these countries indicate for the long and medium term predictable, credible fiscal policies, anchored in legislation that will not be challenged, which will bring the deficit down in a way that will reverse the debt trajectory to a downward trend," she said.
