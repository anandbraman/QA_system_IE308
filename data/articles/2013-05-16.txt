The US Dollar is HOT. Here's a chart of the trade-weighted dollar index. You can see it rallied in 2012, and has gone nuclear in 2013. FRED So what gives? Dollar strength is the topic of this evening's Morgan Stanley FX Pulse. The basic gist is: It's about weakening yen, strengthening data, increasing US yields relative to the rest of the world (which makes the dollar inherently more valuable), weakening euro, and more hawkish tones from Fed folks. Here's the commentary from Morgan Stanley: There has been a significant shift in global currency market dynamics over the course of the past week, driven not only by the JPY, but increasingly by the USD. We have discussed recently the potential change in the status of USD, with the US increasingly being seen as an investment destination and the USD being used less as a funding currency. This process has continued over the past week, with further strong data from the US leading to a renewed rise in US treasury yields. This rise in US yields now places the USD into the basket of yielding currencies, which suggest further support is likely tobuild over the over medium term. The US data has continued to provide positive signals for the USD, with the renewed improvements in the labour market data of importance, given the Fedâ€™s policy link to theunemployment rate. But, the positive news is broadening beyond the labour market, with a favorable impact on the US consumer also starting to become evident, while our USeconomists now see US Q2 GDP tracking at 1.8% instead of 1.2% The encouraging news from the labour market and elsewhere in the US economy has added to the USD support, especially as the tapering debate is intensifying once again. Indeed, most of the Fed speakers over the past week have been from the more hawkish camp, which has allowed the rise in yields to go unchecked, thus far. The Fedâ€™s Plosser, although not a FOMC voter currently and a known hawk, has led the calls fortapering over the past week. Hence, we place emphasis on Fed chairman Bernankeâ€™s response (next speech due Saturday). If Bernanke decides to address the rise in yieldsthis could cause a pause in the USD recovery, but we would view this as likely to be very brief, providing a renewed USD buying opportunity, especially given the overall more positive signs of growth coming from the US economy.

YouTube / Margin Call TrailerEach week, one of our investing experts answers a reader's question in our InvestingAnswers' Q&amp;A column. Question: Hello. I've decided I want to start investing, and I'm thinking of using an online broker instead of visiting a brokerage firm. Is there anything I need to know before I start? Karen K., Palo Alto, Calif. The Investing Answer: I'm a big fan of online brokers. You can trade any time you want (and almost immediately, if you want), the fees are typically lower than a brick-and-mortar broker, and your investment options are virtually limitless. That said, remember there's no professional guiding your decisions, so without some sense of direction, investing online could seem to be like walking on a tight rope without a net. But don't worry, I'll guide you through the process with these four tips. First, have a way to fund your online investment account. This is simple but often overlooked. Most online brokers want you to be able to transfer funds electronically to your online investment account from a checking account. Many also allow you to mail in checks, cashier's checks or money orders to fund your account, but it may come with fees and slow down your investing plans, so be aware of that. Next, know what you're investing toward. This will help you decide what kind of online investment account you should open. For instance, if you're planning to invest for retirement and not touch the money until you turn 60, you'll likely want toopen an IRA or a Roth IRA account, which offer tax advantages that can save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run (We talk more about this in The 8 Best Reasons to Invest in a Roth IRA). If you're investing for fun or for a shorter term goal, you'll likely just want to open a regular investment account -- then you can sell your investments without penalties (but with normal capital gains tax if you profit from your sale). Third, know your online broker's minimums and fees. When you know what kind of investment account is right for you, you'll be better prepared to shop for the best online broker. Online firms like TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, Sharebuilder, Scottrade and others typically let you buy or sell stocks, ETFs, mutual funds or other investments for $10 per trade or less. And if you want to dollar cost average and invest automatically on a monthly or weekly basis, Sharebuilder charges as little as $4 per trade (as we mention in How Can I Start Investing With Just $100 A Month?) Not all are the same, so get to know each online broker's "fee schedule" or "pricing" pages. Also pay attention to the account minimums, which tell you how much cash you'll need to open an account in the first place (If you're opening a retirement account, most firms typically waive this requirement). Finally (and most importantly), know exactly what you want to invest in. Just as you shouldn't go to the grocery store on an empty stomach without a shopping list, you don't want invest online without a definite plan of what you want to buy. It's not a bad idea to know the basics of investing before you dive in. If you don't have time to research individual companies for eight hours a day, you may consider investing in mutual funds or ETFs that allow you to spread your investment dollars among several companies. If you enjoy the challenge of stock picking, you may want to read The 8 Most Important Facts To Know About A Company Before You Invest to avoid mistakes many investors make when choosing stocks. With cash, some knowledge and a good investment plan under your belt, you should be ready to responsibly invest online in as little as 20 minutes. Good luck!
FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Black Swans Are Having Their Necks Broken (The Reformed Broker) Investment advisor Josh Brown looks at the stock market, the housing market, the energy revolution in the U.S., and the emergence of new industries, and writes that nothing has come of the black swans.  "The Black Swans we'd been guessing at have had their necks broken one by one, their heads bashed in. Blood and feathers, a smear on the wall. We have a stock market that goes up on good news, bad news, no news, and a lot of news. Blue chip companies are posting gains that would make late-90s tech stocks blush. They miss earnings occasionally, drop in price temporarily and find themselves higher than ever within a week. "...The curtain has been pulled back and the alarmists have been revealed for what they are: old men in suits. They are terrified. Their world is going away and no one will listen. They are lashing out, gasping for moments' worth of attention from someone, anyone — even if they must use scare tactics to get it. It's not working. People are going about their lives. They are making long-term plans again." Investors Living In Emerging Markets Are Incredibly Bullish (Mark Mobius) The 2013 Global Investor Sentiment Survey showed that investors in emerging markets are more optimistic on their prospects in 2013 and over the next decade than their counterparts in developed markets.  "58% of investors residing in developed markets believe their local stock market will be up this year, but investors in emerging markets were even more upbeat — 66% believed their local stock market would post a bullish performance in 2013.  Similarly, investors residing in emerging markets expected higher returns on their investments, with an average return expectation of 12% this year and 18% over the next 10 years. Those in developed markets expected a 7% average return in 2013, and 10% over the next 10 years.  "I find that noteworthy as growth rates in emerging markets are also expected to be generally higher than in developed markets this year, although stock market returns don’t always directly correlate with growth rates. In addition, we believe the easy monetary policies of central banks globally could drive more assets into emerging markets." Elite Advisors Have Five Leadership Traits (WealthManagement.com) Affluent investors are looking for "trustworthy leadership," according to Matt Oechsli at WealthManagement.com. In fact he says "elite advisors" have five traits: 1. They lead by example. 2. They lead clients — Proactively and personally communicate with clients, filter the noise. 3. Lead team members — by being a part of the solution, not the problem and by reinforcing a "client-first culture.". 4. Lead prospects — Help them to make better financial decisions and enable them to fully understand their options. 5. They help create "professional alliances." Economists Are Still Getting The Biggest Economic Story Of The Year Wrong (Bank of America)   Economists have long warned that inflation will be one of the dangerous ramifications about all the central bank easing. But Ethan Harris at Bank of America writes that the big story is the lack of inflation. "The weakness has come as a surprise to economic forecasters and an even bigger surprise to many market participants. Critics of the major central banks have repeatedly warned that easy policy would lead to runaway inflation. However, in reality inflation is falling, not rising." BAML Goldman Sachs Makes A Bearish Call On Agricultural Commodities (CNBC) Goldman Sachs expects commodity returns to fall 13% over the next year. "This is being driven by the increasing likelihood of a significant rebound in inventories, on the combination of a realized record-large Latin American harvest, already making its way on the export market and helping rebuild depleted inventories, as well as prospects for record-large U.S. production."

Reuters/Stephen LamIf there is one lesson that resonates from years of watching markets, it's that earnings quality doesn't matter in cult stocks on the rise. Nobody wants to hear it. Look no further than Netflix. Or even Amazon. All of which brings us to Tesla. Flying red flags over its earnings quality would appear to be foolhardy. Still, to ignore it is just as foolhardy, especially given the first sentence of the most recent "shareholder letter" accompanying the fledgling car company's earnings. "Tesla reached profitability in the first quarter of 2013 for the first time in our ten year history," it stated. Furthermore, lower in the same letter Tesla says: "We believe that the accepted automotive industry approach of focusing on margin improvement,profitability and deliveries are the more meaningful metrics for measuring progress." If profits matter going forward, so does earnings quality. And according to Gradient Analytics, the earnings quality gets a grade of 'F." What stands out the most? "So many things," says Gradient research director Donn Vickrey."By declaring themselves profitable, I said there is just no way. How can this be at this point in the cycle? It has to be purely a paper profit and at that some elements of the paper may be lower quality than usual." Paper or not, Vickrey believes whatever Tesla's profitability, it isn't sustainable. Rather than go through all of his points, let's focus on just one: warranty accruals. This is the amount the company puts aside for expected warranty expenses — a non-cash charge that hits earnings as a cost of goods sold. The lower the provision, the less of a hit to earnings. It's highly subjective, and Tesla current reserves at a rate,relative to sales, in-line with Ford and General Motors. But its warranty is longer than mainstream auto companies and "its product is based on new technology with unproven reliability," according to Gradient's report on Tesla." Of particular concern: The firm's eight-year, 100,000 mile battery warranty could prove to be extremely costly." But what if the company is so new it simply doesn't know — so uses existing auto companies as a benchmark? Under accounting rules, Vickrey says, if you don't know what they'll be "they should be higher, not lower." Put another way: it could be yet another possible hit to earnings. All in, Gradient estimates that once nonrecurring, unsustainable "and cosmetic" benefits are removed — rather than reporting a profit of $11.3 million, Tesla would've lost $91 million. And that doesn't include a more conservative warranty accrual. The good news, that's better than the $464 million it lost a year earlier — but not "profitable." And we're not even talking about anything to support the current valuation. My take: We've seen this before. Cult stocks like this run over any and all skeptics and critics — and Tesla is likely to continue leaving tire marks for the foreseeable future. Earnings quality, or lack thereof, rarely matters at this phase of a growth company's cycle. But Tesla makes such a big point of talking "profitability" that it should. And what I know is this: investors may not care about earnings quality now, but one day it's likely they will wish they had. This has nothing to do with Tesla the car, and everything to do with Tesla's potential vulnerability with its stock. P.S.: Tesla the stock is very dear to CEO Elon Musk. According to Tesla's proxy, his option grants are tied heavily to the company's market cap. Onward... —By CNBC's Herb Greenberg.

The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management just released revised rules governing hydraulic fracturing â€” fracking â€” on public lands. They seem to have upset both environmentalists and the industry â€”Â we've already received two insta-press releases from both sides criticizing the updated regulations. The actual news is that energy firms will continue to be able to use the online databank FracFocus to report chemicals they've used in their drilling process. A Harvard study recently criticized FracFocus for being essentially self-regulated by the industry. Meanwhile, firms will have to report how far away they're drilling from aquifers. Other rules: Here's the full release:Â  BML Frack rules by Rob Wile 
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's reputation has taken a hit since Business Insider's story tied CEO Michael Jeffries' comments about beautiful people to the company's refusal to offer XL and XXL clothing.  Two weeks ago, the company's reputation was similar to that of competitors American Eagle Outfitters and H&amp;M, according to a report by YouGov BrandIndex.  But since the story, Abercrombie's reputation among 18 to 34-year-olds has tanked.  YouGov asked respondents "If you've heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, was it positive or negative?" Here's a chart showing how Abercrombie compares with other brands:  YouGov BrandIndex The company just responded to the uproar today, with Jeffries sticking by the company's policies and refusing to apologize for comments he made that he only wanted "cool" and "beautiful" people wearing the brand. 
Zack Buckley, managing partner at Buckley Capital Partners, gave an interesting bullish presentation for tech company Blucora at this year's Value Investing Congress in Las Vegas. Blucora is a company that operates two internet businesses — TaxACT, a tax prep site, and InfoSpace, an online search and monetization service for small businesses. According to Buckley, in buying Blucora you're getting those two businesses for the price of one. InfoSpace, he says, is basically free. More importantly, it won't get gobbled by Google because it serves small businesses that Google doesn't want to chase. The downside is that there is a lot of uncertainty in the internet search space, but with Blucora growing 18% annually since 2009, this is something worth looking at.
Michael SetoWe recently reported that Mark Cuban refinanced every last dollar of his debt into Japanese Yen. There are two reasons to do this. One is that interest rates in Japan are very low. The other reason is that it's a yen short. If the value of the yen collapses (as it has been) then over time it become cheaper and cheaper to pay back the loan. So obviously we wanted to figure out how anyone could do the same bet. Would it be possible for a homeowner to refi their mortage in yen, so that as the yen falls their mortgage gets cheaper? We asked around. Unfortunately, it looks like this financing scheme is only available to the ultra-wealthy. Prior to the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations, there were two ways to go about doing what Cuban did. The first was called a cross-currency swap. This is a financial derivative that involves paying someone to borrow money from a different currency. For example: You give a bank X dollars, the bank gives you Y yen, you pay the bank TIBOR (the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, aka the cost to borrow yen), the bank pays you LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate, used for dollars). When the loan comes due, you get back your X dollars, the bank gets back its Y yen.  But with the advent of Dodd-Frank, these types of swaps became highly regulated. You must now have at least $10 million to your name to pull one off — not a problem for Cuban, but a slightly larger hurdle for the rest of us. The other way — still legal, as far as we know — is to find a retail U.S. bank with access to the foreign currency reserves of your choice that would also be willing to sell you a foreign currency loan. You can also pull this off if you already own assets in the currency in which you want to borrow.   But banks offering such products are now extremely rare. Foreign currency loans bankrupted mom-and-pop types across Europe who took out mortgages at then-cheaper rates that subsequently spiked.  As one source told us: The Hungarians just borrowed in CHF (Swiss francs), converted to their own currency, and prayed the foreign exchange rate wouldn't hurt them when they had to make their CHF payments. But in an arguably rare act of self-policing, most banks have since eliminated such products.   Basically, if you were hoping to refinance your debt at Japan's interest rates, just forget about it.
kpbs.orgConvicted ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff, who is serving a 150 year prison sentence, told CNN Money's Aaron Smith that he blames himself for the death of his oldest son.  From CNN Money: "I was responsible for my son Mark's death and that's very, very difficult," he said. "I live with that. I live with the remorse, the pain I caused everybody, certainly my family, and the victims." Madoff's son Mark committed suicide by hanging himself in December 2010 on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Mark, who was only 46 at the time of his death, worked at his father's firm.    Madoff also told CNN Money that he has trouble sleeping at night.  
ReutersMore than four years after America's hydraulic fracturing boom kicked off, conflicts of interest between officials charged with regulating the controversial practice and the oil and gas industry remain widespread. Meanwhile, in-depth studies of fracking's effects on human health and the environment remain scant. Conflicts of interest and undue corporate influence among drilling regulators features prominently in "Gasland II," documentarian Josh Fox's follow-up to his high-profile 2010 film "Gasland." "Gasland II" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last month. While the problem has so far been limited to states experiencing shale booms, some are concerned it's set to rear it's head in Washington, where the Interior Department will this afternoon announce new regulations for fracking on federal lands. Hydraulic fracturing, which involves shooting large volumes of water and chemicals into rock formations to unlock oil and natural gas deposits, has been around for decades. Yet until just a few years ago, the practice was limited to rural areas where the energy industry formed the basis of the local economy. It now comprises an ever-growing portion of all oil and gas produced.Â  "We know almost literally nothing about human health effects," said Duke biology professor Rob Jackson, author of a study that found a correlation between drilling and methane in northeast Pennsylvania. "Without human health studies, it's hard to conclude a process is safe."Â  The EPA is currently conducting a multi-year study that will address some of those issues, but it won't be completedÂ until next year at the earliest. North Carolina officials were set to unveil a new set of rules on fracking in that state earlier this month. But the legislation was scuttled after Halliburton intervened,Â according to the Charlotte News Observer's John Murawski.Â "There seem to be conversations happening offline and not in public about this rule that has already come out of committee,â€ he quotes one member of the Mining &amp; Energy CommissionÂ as saying. Murawski notes officials are under extreme pressure to usher in more drilling â€” and the royalties that come with it. Earlier, he writes, a bill was introduced toÂ to remove two members from the commission, including the state geologist. The most contentious rule dealt with disclosing what chemicals companies were using in their drilling. The industry is highly opposed to disclosure, ostensibly because it could be subject to freedom of information requests from competitors. Â  One of the more striking examples Fox highlights in his film occurred in Texas, where two years ago the EPA found evidence a well was leaking methane gas into two homes near Fort Worth. Then, according to emails obtained by Energywire's Mike Soraghan, former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell appears to have intervened. From Energywire: An EPA attorney wrote that Rendell, acting as a "spokesman for Range," met with [EPA Chief Lisa] Jackson in 2011 and "proposed certain terms to the administrator." But the case didn't settle for more than a year after that. When EPA and Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., dropped the case, Range did not agree to do testing sought by the Texas-based EPA officials. They had wanted Range to test whether natural gas might be seeping into homes from the soil, but that was not part of the agreement. In the same case, the AP found that although the EPA had scientific evidence against Range, the agency stepped back after the company threatened not to participate in the agency's ongoing fracking study. "Regulators set aside an analysis that concluded the drilling could have been to blame for the contamination," AP'sÂ Ramit Plushnick-Masti reported. Range denies there was any improper influence. Meanwhile in Pennsylvania â€” ground zero of the natgas drilling boom â€” a recent report by the Public Accountability Initiative suggested a "revolving door" between state officials and oil and gas firms. A few years ago in the town of Dimock, EPA regulators raised concerns about possible contamination and treatment systems from drilling activities performed by Cabot Oil and Gas. They raised the prospect of invoking federal authority over the area if Cabot was found to be using diesel fuel in its drilling (the feds cannot invoke the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate fracking unless diesel fuel is being used). Yet they ended up not doing so, according to Laura Legere of the Scranton Times-Tribune: A lawyer for the regional EPA office said the agency never asked Cabot if it used diesel in its wells because the EPA was still working at the time to define what it meant by "diesel" as it developed regulations for wells fracked with the fuel. A Cabot spokesman did not respond to a question about the allegations of diesel use. Families in the area ended up settling with CabotÂ over the issue. The situation in the state was summed up in a recent blog post by John Hanger, the former head of the state's environmental regulatory agency and now candidate for governor. He hits out at incumbent Tom Corbett for easing up on gas industry oversight: The public has rightly lost confidence in the willingness of the Corbett administration to adequately regulate gas drilling. The governor has created this crisis in public confidence by opposing a drilling tax, by combatively reacting to legitimate public questions and concerns about drilling, and by reducing enforcement of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s gas regulations.Â  Violations issued to the gas industry have declined by 50% since 2010, when DEP cited the gas industry 1,200 times. Ironically, Hanger himself is named in the PAI report for his law firm's ties to the industry. By one account, the problem may have already leaked into the Interior Department, which is about to release its final rule on fracking later today. Via Platts: [NJ Rep. Rush] Holt, who said the rule was necessary to "guarantee a minimal level of safety and environmental protection," said he fears the new rule "won't be strong enough." The Interior Department is expected to weaken disclosure rules for chemical and well construction techniques, Holt said.Â  He said a strong federal rule was needed since fracking regulations "vary widely" by state. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell denied the charge. "The fracking rules are not bowing to industry pressure or environmental pressure," Jewell said according to Reuters. If that's true, they've done a mighty job of warding it off.

www.thecollaredsheep.comBrett Easton Ellis, the author of "American Psycho" (the scariest book written about Wall Street) and several other must-read novels, did a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" the other day.  It was a pretty good AMA and we'd recommend reading the full thing.  Here's an excerpt.  (Note: This has been lightly edited for clarity): Reddit User:  How did you write such disgusting scenes in American Psycho. How did they even get in you? Where did you find such inspiration? Especially for the rat, that was EXTREMELY F*****D UP. Also, huge fan here. American Psycho is my favorite book of yours. Easton Ellis:  I waited to write those scenes until the book was finished. Since I didn't really know how to approach them. I did a little bit of research with some kind of FBI textbook that went into super-gruesome detail about serial killers. Then just being in [Patrick Bateman's] brain for three years--it all came together. Very upsetting scenes to write. Reddit User: What did you think of American Psycho 2? Easton Ellis: It was a breathtaking masterpiece. Reddit User: Music has always played a large role, in many of your works. The playlists that exist for each book - were these assembled after the fact, or do the songs in your books reflect what you were listening to while writing them? Easton Ellis: Those playlists absolutely reflected what I was listening to at the time I was writing those books.  Reddit User: Favorite author? Besides yourself, of course. Easton Ellis: Gustave Flaubert. Reddit User: Could you explain the ending to American psycho to me like I'm a 5 year old? Easton Ellis: Not really, babe.  Reddit User: Hey there, been waiting all day, and impressed you came early! I'm a huge fan of American Psycho, and was wondering how you chose what Patrick Bateman's rants were going to be about, and how you researched them. Did you pick music artists/clothing styles that you personally like, or that you think Patrick would like? Or both? Thanks for doing this! Easton Ellis: Well, in a lot of ways Patrick's rants are about wanting to fit into a society that he doesn't believe in. That's where I was, too. At the time. So a lot of the rants came from my frustration as well. Not a lot of research into that. I didn't like any of the music Patrick liked but it was popular at the time and it seemed to reflect a certain kind of mass-taste that PB wanted to be a part of. As for clothes: yeah, I wore a suit like a lotta guys did in that period but not nearly as fashion-conscious as PB. Reddit User: Mr. Ellis – thank you for everything you’ve done for the first amendment. You are good for America. 1) How did you come up with the magical line from Glamorama “The better you look, the more you see?” What type of research did you do for the shower scene? 2) Do you enjoy Dexter? Who would win in a murder off – Dex or Patrick Bateman? 3) Supposedly in NYC you had the season’s greatest Christmas party every year. Did you and what made them so epic?4) Edward St. Aubyn, David Mitchell or Alan Hollinghurst? Easton Ellis: 1. I don't remember. I think it was combining a couple of ads I saw in the '90s. And then it became a mantra for Victor Ward. The research for the shower scene was an accumulation of many shower scenes or variations thereof. 2. You know what? I never really got Dexter. I know a lot of people involved with the show. And I don't want to diss it. But it seemed too high-concept and jokey for me. I think Dexter would probably quite easily do away with PB. :( 3.  Christmas parties were packed. Anyone could come. I always liked the party scene in the film Breakfast At Tiffany's: that's the vibe I wanted. 4. I have read and admired all three authors. I think they have all written excellent novels. P r o p s Reddit User: What do you miss about the 80s? Easton Ellis: Well, I guess on a surface level a kind of analog/Empire way of life. But, really, the '80s didn't thrill me. So: not a lot, guys. Reddit User: How is the current novel going, and is it a sequel to American Psycho? Easton Ellis: Not a sequel to American Psycho. Honestly: the last month or so it has gone kind of slowly. Distracted by other things that are going on. Thinking it through, making notes, deciding which way to go. Reddit User: In your experience, what restaurant has been the most difficult to get a reservation to? Easton Ellis: If a restaurant is "too difficult" to get into: why the f*** bother? I don't have an answer to that because if I couldn't get in somewhere I just moved on. Unlike, of course, PB. Read the rest of the AMA at Reddit &gt;
Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP — a anti-immigration, anti-EU political party that has been having serious successes in recent elections — was forced to hide in a pub in Edinburgh today after being hounded by "anti-racism" protesters. This picture, from the Guardian's Scotland correspondent, shows the crowd outside: Police lock Nigel #Farage into Edinburgh pub has furious anti Ukip demo forces him off street twitter.com/severincarrell… According to the Daily Record, there were dozens of protesters outside chanting "racist Nazi scum."  Farage attempted to escape in a passing taxi, the Scottish Herald reports, but was forced to retreat to the pub. He eventually left in a police riot van as the crowd chanted  "Leave Scotland, go back to England." The protest had been organized by a group called Radical Independence Edinburgh, a grassroots organization seeking Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. Farage has told the BBC that he has never had a reaction like this before.
Whenever the WSJ's Jon Hilsenrath speaks, everyone in the market listens. Hilsenrath is out with a new blog post on WSJ.com this afternoon aimed at one of the hottest topics surrounding Federal Reserve policy right now: persistently low inflation, which could keep the Federal Reserve from tapering monetary stimulus anytime soon. New data on consumer prices out today revealed that consumer prices were up 1.7% on a year-over-year basis when stripping out food and energy, two volatile components that have been dragged down recently by a big sell-off in the commodity space. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, however – core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) – is only up 1.1% from a year ago, well short of the Fed's 2% inflation target. Although the Fed's preferred inflation reading is showing much more disinflation (positive, but falling inflation) than the more traditional consumer price index out today, Hilsenrath just chalks this up to quirks in the way the two indices are calculated, and he asserts that "even though inflation measures have fallen sharply in recent months, Federal Reserve officials aren’t ringing alarm bells about it as they have done in the past." Here's more from Hilsenrath: One of [the quirks in PCE] is a measure known as “financial services furnished without payment.” This is the government’s way of tracking what households pay for bundled bank services like access to ATM machines or check-writing. “This would be any service provided by a bank for which there is no explicit payment,” says Brent Moulton, the associate director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Without a market price to go on, the Commerce Department imputes a cost to consumers for these services based on complex formulas that move as interest rates shift. It turns out that right now interest rates are shifting in a way that drives down the imputed value of this service. In the first quarter the price of this service fell 2.2% from a year earlier and since the second quarter of 2011 it has fallen on average by 1% annually, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These measures are down largely because interest rates are falling, Mr. Moulton said, not necessarily because the actual cost of the service is going down. Strip out the quirky number and the decline in core consumer prices was 0.2 percentage points less severe in the first quarter than the official figure, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. A measure which strips out all imputed prices in the core consumer price index was up 1.31% in March, again more than the 1.13% number. That, says Hilsenrath, may be why the Fed isn't expressing concern over low inflation yet. As the WSJ's economics reporter, Hilsenrath has earned the nickname "Fedwire" due to his close ties to Fed insiders. Economist Stephen Roach once joked: "Jon Hilsenrath is actually the chairman of the Fed." Note: Earlier we reported in error that Hilsenrath told CNBC about "important messages" that the Federal Reserve would be delivering tomorrow. This was actually in reference to a story from August 2012.
There's something about having the British royals around that makes Americans of all ages act like it's 1964 again and the Beatles just landed. Prince Harry's latest tour of the country was no exception. His week-long trip was marked by a seemingly endless barrage of pictures of girls crying/staring adoringly/ squealing (and so forth) from Washington D.C. to Colorado. Chris Christie looked charmed, the media went nuts, and (of course), there was an interview on Good Morning America. The madness culminated yesterday, when Harry played in an exclusive polo match for the 3rd Annual Sentebale Royal Salute Polo Cup in Greenwich, Connecticut. Now, as you've probably figured, Greenwich doesn't do frenzy like teen girls in New Jersey do frenzy. We're talking about the hedge fund capital of the world here. The event was held at the Greenwich Polo Club, a gorgeous, sprawling piece of countryside owned by billionaire businessman Peter Brant — Land Rover and St. Regis were two of the sponsors. And of course, the event had a cause. The Sentebale Royal Salute Polo Cup is a fundraiser for Sentebale, a charity Prince Harry founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in honor of their mothers. The organization benefits children that have been impacted by the AIDS crisis in southern Africa, and it's looking to expand its efforts throughout the region. Put all that together and you've got a royal, a great cause, and the sport of kings. This, ladies and gentleman, is Greenwich's wheelhouse. Pernod RicardOnly 400 tickets were available for this invite-only party, and they seem to have sold out in March. And why wouldn't they — How often do Princes come around for the afternoon? The party started at 11:30 am, with guests trickling in slowly (some opting in to do the step and repeat — we did not) during a cocktail hour sponsored by Royal Salute Whisky. It rained — no one cared. Around 12:15 pm, the colorfully clad polo patrons started filing into a large white dining tent to await the Prince. Sometime before the gnocchi or filet mignon, he got on stage and made a speech about Sentabale. And you know something? Prince Harry has a very welcoming demeanor. He smiles alot, he chuckles at people's jokes, he has a relaxed and confident stance. Since he's so at ease, it puts you at ease — and that means you listen. Sentebale funds Mamohato Camps, places where kids with HIV can get educated about their status and receive the physical and psychological support they need. This is intended not only to help the kids as individuals, but also as a way to use education to stop the spread of the disease. "Many of you may have heard this before and you're thinking, 'another African Charity,'" said Prince Harry. "But we believe the Mamohato Camps are a real game changer." Harry's time at lunch was cut short because he had to prep for the polo match, and that takes some doing. Helmet and boots aside, if you want to play in a game of polo, you need four extremely smart, extremely fearless, well-trained horses — one for each 7 minute period (the periods are called chuckers). And you need to know how good you are. Every polo player is given a "goal" handicap from -2 to 10. There are only a few ten goals in the world, and the two highest rated players on the field yesterday, polo stars Nacho Figueras and Malcolm Borwick, are both 6s. Pernod RicardHarry is a 1 goal. But if you haven't spent your life leaning sideways on a saddle hitting a fairly small ball with a stick while a horse runs at full speed, that's pretty good. Polo pros are tireless wanderers, constantly traveling with their families to places where polo is in season. (Figueras, for example, had his wife and kids with him). This match marked the beginning of polo in the New York area. So a slightly tipsy, definitely well-dressed group of party-goers got to watch Harry lean, yell, and careen across the field. The rain stopped, the sun shined, and aside from a brief moment when Harry's teammate Michael Carrazza, a private equity CEO, suffered a minor injury, there were no physical hiccups. And then the Sentebale team won. The Cup was presented by former Victoria Secret model Karolina Kurkova, there was kissing and hand waving, and cheering — and then poof, Prince Harry was gone. The party still went on though. It's not like you need a Prince to throw a good party in Greenwich.
APAs he finds himself and his administration embroiled in "scandal," President Barack Obama held one of the biggest press conferences of his time in office Thursday afternoon. The press conference was a joint session with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But the questions from the White House press corps focused on the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups, the Department of Justice's obtaining of AP journalists' phone records, and new revelations about last September's terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Starting on Wednesday, the Obama administration sought to take the offensive on the three different issues. It released 100 pages of Benghazi-related emails attempting to downplay the administration's role in shaping the talking points after the attack. Then, Obama announced that he had forced the resignation of acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller.  We'll be covering the press conference live. Check back here for updates. UPDATES: In his opening remarks, Obama reaffirmed that both the U.S. and Turkey believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "needs to go." Obama also made a statement on Benghazi.  "I am intent on making sure we prevent another tragedy from happening again," he said, focusing on a push for more security at U.S. embassies around the world. He called on Congress to approve funding for more personnel and security at U.S. embassies. Question 1: Obama is asked about the IRS scandal. "My main concern is fixing a problem," he said, again calling the actions "outrageous and unacceptable." He also repeated that he was unaware of the IRS' targeting until news reports started coming out on Friday. “I’m a public figure," Obama added. "If a future administration is using the tax laws to favor one party over another ... we're all vulnerable.” Question 2:  The second White House press corps question comes from the Associated Press, which had journalists' phone records obtained by the DoJ. Obama was asked about comparisons to President Richard Nixon. "I'll let you guys engage in those comparisons. You can go ahead and read the history or whatever," he said. On the Department of Justice's obtaining of phone records, Obama said he wouldn't comment on the specific case. Broadly, he said he would not apologize for leak investigations with a clear tie to national security. "I make no apologies and I don't think the American people would expect me not to be concerned," Obama said. Asked directly, Obama reiterated that he had "complete confidence" in Attorney General Eric Holder. "He has operated with integrity, and I expect he will continue to do so," Obama said.
">Associated PressStill jet-lagged by 8 hours from a day and a half in London, I haven't slept for a good 48 hours and remembered I owe WSO my process for dissecting a 10-k in the usual form. Before I get right into it, keep in mind every business is different and that will dictate the way you should read their specific annual report. What might be important to look at for an oil &amp; gas company might be completely ignored for a hardline retail company, so don't take this as gospel when your PM tells you to get up to speed on a company and you remember the stupid shit old BlackHat told you was right and you end up missing something crucial to making an investment decision. So with that, here is a full breakdown of how I like to look through a 10-K for the first time, what's important to focus on, and what can be glazed over (if anything) to save time and/or not confuse yourself. As always, I'll field questions afterwards if and when I feel like it to clear anything up. Business Description No matter how simple the business appears to be on the outside, I always go into researching a new business assuming I know absolutely nothing because chances are I do. On the cover page alone, I'll always highlight a few things: fiscal year end, headquarters location, and shares outstanding/market cap if included. Simple stuff, but I still do it no matter what. Moving on, business description is the first portion of every K. Things that are surprisingly important to me include the history of the business and any historical changes in the company's defined reportable segments. The way a business perceives its moving parts is really important to understanding what they consider important. Sometimes management will decide to move from functional segmentation to geographic segmentation (or the other way around), or might simply consolidate segments or anything similar. I always want this in mind before I get into the granular aspects of the business so I have a frame of reference for how management looks at their own business. If I end up disagreeing it could be an interesting angle if we end up doing something activism-ish or if this may be a short candidate. I always read the Business section in its entirety (note: I read every section in its entirety to be honest). Besides the things I've already mentioned, the obvious things to focus on are revenue breakdown by whatever segmentation they choose, key business relationships, and key business risks. The main things I'm trying to answer in this section are: 1) Where is the crown jewel of this business? I want to identify the cash generator/main earnings driver for the company. Most of the time this isn't going to be the same segment as what I'm looking for in #2, but it's very important to understand what the majority cash generator is for the company. Normally a company can't survive long enough without its bread and butter to develop any high-growth areas, so determining the key risks to it are just as significant as determining the catalysts to the explosion of another segment. 2) What is the major growth generator? Having a cash cow is great, but doesn't make for a compelling investment if it's growing top line at 1% annually. Normally management will make a point to highlight any major growth in a particular segment, but then again sometimes they won't. Always have this question in your mind when you're looking through segment information. If sales as a % of revenue have moved up from something like low teens to mid-thirties over the past few years, all the sudden you may have a good idea of where growth is coming from... or where a segment will have to pick up the slack as a crown jewel business starts to wither away... 3) Where are the key risks for #1 and #2? Section 1A will always list the risks to the business. A certain chunk of business risks seem identical in every company and can probably be skimmed, but firm-specific risks can be very important and disclose some important information. The things you can usually glaze over include the standard "macroeconomic conditions" clauses, litigation risks (unless it's a litigation-heavy business like a medical supplier, car company, airline, etc.), and key man statements. Specific things to look for might be in regards to expansion plans re: the growth engine and market share or other revenue losses re: the crown jewel. Management will usually outline what they think is scary about both of these things, and that will help you build a foundation for what you need to go out and investigate after you're done reading the K. Properties Skim through them, but usually not a big deal because there should be no surprises here. If it's a retailer and they provide historic square footage numbers, it's helpful to see how square footage has grown and you'll probably want to evaluate sales/sq. ft. over time to see how if the business has been able to grow its store base in an efficient way. Commitments/Contingencies (i.e. Litigation) Again, not particularly important for most but sometimes in lock-step with the business risks section, management might highlight a certain lawsuit or risk of lawsuit that could be make or break for the company. In those cases, obviously focusing on this section becomes a must. But when Kohl's has a $12M lawsuit hanging over its head in regards to a black woman's discrimination lawsuit after she got fired for shoplifting, you probably don't need to spend too much time figuring out what's gonna happen with that one. Market for Equity / Selected Financial Data The market for equity section should be pretty straight forward, and chances are if you decided to take a look at the company you already know where their stock has traded recently and if they have a dividend. Other times though you might want to at least skim over this to see if there could be any plans for a dividend or discontinuation of a dividend. Usually one of the more unimportant sections to me (except maybe Mine Safety Disclosures, haha). Selected Financial Data is your first look at the actual performance of the business. I don't spend too much time here but I like to get an idea of the recent growth trends on the important line items, a sense of the margins at a high level, and anything particular that sticks out, like enormous one-time charges or a year where all the sudden everything fell off a cliff. These are really just things that quantify our idea of business risks, and hopefully we'll see these addressed later in the MD&amp;A or footnotes. If not, we have some phone calls to make... Management Discussion &amp; Analysis This, along with the notes to the statements themselves, are pretty much the bulk of the K for understanding what the hell is going on with a business. I spend a good amount of time scrutinizing this section and tend to re-read it once or twice before I feel like I'm actually done with that particular K. This is where the management team will outline their strategy and give a breakdown of what happened during the fiscal year. It's not uncommon for this section to be a way for the company to explain away their failures, or to pump a successful plan. While I think this section is different for every company, the big things to watch for in getting acquainted with the way the business runs are 1) the important operating metrics that management uses to gauge performance, 2) any non-GAAP accounting that you might otherwise come across in an earnings release and be confused by, and 3) understanding the cash position of the business and seeing where any cash burn might be coming from. I always find myself playing the role of operator of a competitor, trying to scrutinize management's positions on everything they explain and coming up with a list of questions - no matter how basic - that I might have if they're still unanswered by the time I finish the annual report. This section also helps for providing some outlook and giving you better visibility/confidence in any projections you might make for an operating model.

WikipediaSeveral people were slightly injured in a ferry accident near Battery Park CityÂ in lower Manhattan, NBC reports. One of the passengers suffered an elbow injury when the boat bumped the pier, police said, and other injuries were minor. Fire Department responders are on scene. We'll have more information as it becomes available, but it seems to be a minor incident with no serious injuries.
Humans live in equilibrium with other species in a finite world. In such a world, there is never really a Steady State. Instead, there is a constant ebb and flow. Â  One species may be dominant in an area for a while, and then another. If populations are closely matched in â€œability,â€ then the ups and downs arenâ€™t too severe. If a predator depends on a particular type of prey for its dinner, it canâ€™t eat all of the prey, or it will go hungry. When the populations of various species are graphed, they rise and fall. Â We usually think of a close match, such as depicted in this graph: Â Wikipedia Figure 2. Volterra_Lotka equations used to illustrate situation where population of predators and prey do not vary over too wide a range. Source: Wikipedia. In fact, the variability of the many species over time tends to be greater than this, as illustrated by the following model that started with 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs: Â Wikipedia Figure 3. Lotka-Volterra equations used to illustrate situation that begins with 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs. Source: Wikipedia If species evolve together, a natural balance tends to remain in place. If a species suddenly finds a new, better source of nourishment (really, energy supplies, since food supplies energy), its population may increase greatly. For example, yeast may metabolize the sugar in grape juice, converting it to alcohol. The yeast population temporarily rises and then declines, as the food source disappears and alcohol pollution poisons the yeast. Or bacteria may multiply inside the human body, if they find the right nutrients and the bodyâ€™s systems for fighting them off are not sufficiently activated. An example is sometimes given of reindeer introduced to St. Matthews Island near Alaska, where there was considerable lichen on the rock. The reindeer ate the lichen at a speed faster than the lichen could reproduce. Soon the lichen was gone, and the reindeer population crashed. Â Based on the Research of David R. Klein of University of Alaska Figure 4. Assumed population of St. Matthew Reindeer herd, with actual counts given. Based on research of David R. KleinÂ of University of Alaska. The reindeer example is similar to a very severe predator-prey curve. The reindeer ate a renewable resource faster than it could reproduce. There were a few other food sources a reindeer could eat, so a few reindeer remained, but there was a very sharp drop in the number of reindeer. The population of humans has ramped up greatly in recent times: Gail TverbergÂ  Figure 5. World population based on data from â€œAtlas of World History,â€ McEvedy and Jones, Penguin Reference Books, 1978 and Wikipedia-World Population. The most recent growth coincides with the addition of fossil fuels to the energy supplies used by humans, starting about 1800. If we look back, we see though that human population has been ramping up for a very long period. Humans discovered how to control fire over 1,000,000 years ago. Since 75,000 BCE, there has been fairly consistent population growth, if we look at the data on a log/log graph. Â Gail Tverberg Figure 6. Log/log graph of human population growth, with energy sources giving rise to this growth. The initial growth of human population occurred with the discovery of how to burn biomass, and how to use it for such purposes as cooking, keeping warm, honing stone tools to a sharper edge, and scaring predator animals away. All of these uses allowed ancestors of modern man to spread over a wider area of the globe, while at the same time wiping out many species of animals, as humans spread to new areas. Biologist and paleontologistÂ Niles EldridgeÂ says thatÂ Phase OneÂ of theÂ Sixth Mass ExtinctionÂ beganÂ when the first modern humans began to disperse to different parts of the world about 100,000 years ago. Phase TwoÂ began about 10,000 years ago when humans turned to agriculture. Even at these early stages, energy use by humans allowed human population to grow at the expense of the population of predator species. There was a lull in human world population growth between 1 CE and 800 CE (Figure 6). In this period, there were many local collapses, so growth in one area tended to offset collapse in another area. When these collapses happened, they generally looked financial in nature, according to the research of Peter Turchin and Surgey Nefedov in Secular Cycles. Populations had found a new resource that allowed them to have more food supplyâ€“say cleared land of trees or learned to do irrigation. But over time, population grew, and caught up with available resources. At the same time, the resources started degrading. The soil started eroding, or became less fertile, and or salt built up from irrigation. Wages of the common worker dropped, and it was hard to get adequate nourishment. Epidemics became common. The general shape of these collapses was approximately as follows: Â Gail Tverberg Figure 7. Shape of typical Secular Cycle, based on work of Peter Turkin and Sergey Nefedov. So even in the Year 1 CE to Year 800 CE period, there was not a Steady State. Instead, there was a combination of overshoot an collapse type waves of the types seen with other species in different parts of the globe, which together averaged out to relatively flat world population growth. Angus Maddison analyzed GDP growth in the 1 CE to 1000CE period. He concluded that the per capita GDP was was slightly lower at the end of the period (453) than at the beginning of the period (476). He doesnâ€™t give amounts at the Year 800. But assuming that the change was fairly representative, the period 1CE to 800CE or 1 CE to 1000CE was close to a Steady State economy (with lots of collapses), considering the lack of both population growth and GDP growth per capita. In more recent times, humans were able to add more energy sources (including peat moss, windmills, and water mills). The also developed better ocean-going ships that allowed them to make colonies, and spread agriculture further, and demand that these colonies extract resources to support the home country. Also, with a more globalized world, agriculture could be improved by allowing a wider choice of domesticated plants and animals, by introducing species from other parts of the world. Since 1800, the growth in fossil fuels has helped ramp up both population and standards of living. Â Gail Tverberg Figure 8. Per capita world energy consumption, calculated by dividing world energy consumption (based on Vaclav Smil estimates from Energy Transitions: History, Requirements and Prospects together with BP Statistical Data for 1965 and subsequent) by population estimates, based on Angus Maddison data. What Are Humanâ€™s Options for Living in a Steady State Economy? I am not sure there are many good choices: 1. If we went back to the period before the ancestors of humans discovered fire, about 100,000 to 200,000 of us could live in the warm areas of the world, eating raw food, and living much as chimpanzees and baboons do today, based on populations of those primates today. The population of humans under such a scenario would fluctuate upward and downward, perhaps as in Figure 1. At this point the internal organs of human have adapted to eating a diet that includes many cooked foods, so it is not clear that our teeth and internal organs could handle such a diet, unless we happened to live in a part of the world where a soft diet (berries, fish and worms) was available. It would also need to be warm, so our lack of fur would not be a problem. To meet these criteria, the population might need to be even lower. 2. Having no humans at all is by definition a Steady State. I am doubtful that most people would consider this an acceptable Steady State, however. 3. If we did not have globalization, and stopped adding energy supplies, we might continue to have local collapses, as in the 1CE to 800CE or 1000CE period, and sort of approximate a Steady State. Of course, now with globalization, a problem in one part of the world quickly spreads to other parts of the world. 4. If we want 7 billion people to be able to continue to live, we will need some basic level of energy supplies for these 7 billion people. If we assume that as a minimum, people today will need at least the 1820 level of energy consumption (based on Figure 8), we will need total energy consumption of at least 22 gigajoules per capita. This would amount to about 7% of the current energy consumption of the United States. It would not be enough to perform what we now consider basic functions such as maintaining roads, electrical systems, water systems, and sewer systems, so would be a major step down for US residents. At the 1820 level of energy consumption, we would still need to continue a portion of fossil fuel consumption, since there are now so many of us that biofuels no longer suffice (Figure 8â€“read across at 1820 level). Also, renewables, including todayâ€™s modern hydroelectric and solar panels are made and transported with fossil fuels, so in order to have what we now consider renewables, we would need to continue to have some fossil fuel use. Also, electricity from wind and solar PV needs to be backed up with natural gas electricity generation. In addition to needing energy to maintain a population of 7 billion people, we would also need a way to (a) keep population down, and (b) keep people from using available energy supplies (beyond the 22 gigajoules per capita allotted), to improve their lifestyles. The way we often hear proposed for keeping population down is more education of womenÂ and availability of birth control measures. Unfortunately, this approach is energy dependent. Unless considerable external energy is available, women will have to work in the fields to produce food. This will give them little time for education or the jobs that education would provide. There are a some cultures that have been able to keep population down by less energy-dependent means. For example, China uses strict controls from above. Cultural and religious practices may also be used, such as delayed marriage and long breastfeeding. In some cases, abortion or infanticide may be used. Keeping people from using available energy supplies to improve their lifestyles is even trickier. Some central authority can dictate that the US will use only 7% of the energy the population used in the past, meaning that everyone has to give up nearly everything. But enforcing this will be a real trick, unless energy supplies really are constrained. There seems to be a common belief that cutting down on personal transportation fuel would have a big impact on total energy consumption. In the US, gasoline amounts to about 44% of US oil consumption. If we eliminated all gasoline consumption (even that by police, ambulances, and sales people), it would only reduce US energy consumption Â (all types, not just oil)Â by 16%. On a worldwide basis, much less oil is used for personal transportation, so eliminating all oil for personal transportation would likely reduce world energy consumption by something like 10% to 12%. Is There a Reason for Aiming for a Steady State Economy?Â  At this point, we seem to be headed for collapse, because humansâ€™ growth is so far out of line in relationship to that of other species. In addition, we are many other limits, including the cost of oil extraction, availability of fresh water, and amount of pollution (including CO2 pollution). Also, governments are increasingly poor financial condition, because when there are not enough resources to go around, governments tend to â€œcome up shortâ€. They canâ€™t collect enough taxes relative to the benefits they pay out and all of the government programs they administer. The only way a Steady State would make sense would be if there were some level of Steady State that humans could fall back to, instead of collapse. Unfortunately, it is hard to see a good place to fall back to. The only period where human population was relatively constant was in the period 1 CE to 800 CE, when frequent collapses kept populations down. It is difficult to see any point at which humans have not increased population, or increased resource use, if resources were available, except when frequent civilization collapse overwhelmed the system. If our civilization does collapse to a lower level, but not all the way back to 0, it seems likely that humans will again repeat the pattern they have experienced, over and over. They will again grow population and resource use, if resources are available. This pattern seems to be an instinct for all species, which is why it is virtually impossible to eliminate. Humans will then again collapse back, to a more sustainable level. www.nasa.gov Filed under: Financial Implications Tagged: collapse, GDP, population, steady state, steady state economy Â  Read more posts on Our Finite World Â»
OneWire, a leading career site for finance professionals, has another installment of its Open Door video interview series out. This time, OneWire CEO Skiddy von Stade sits down with Deborah Wright, the President and CEO of Carver Bancorp. Wright discusses her fascinating life story, from becoming one of the first African American children to integrate the Bennetsville, South Carolina school system, to running the largest publicly traded African American bank in the United States. Wright recalls of her childhood, â€œI think for me it was first or second grade when all of the big court decisions came down striking down â€˜Separate But Equal.â€™ And so one Sunday morning, my father volunteered us to be one of the families that would be the first to integrate the Bennetsville elementary school system.â€ After earning an AB, JD, and MBA from Harvard University, Wright went on to pursue an incredibly successful career that has spanned both the private and public sectors. Deborah began her career as an Associate at First Boston. From there, she joined the business advocacy group, New York City Partnership, and was soon named to the New York City Housing Authority Board by Mayor David N. Dinkins. She went on to serve in the Giuliani administration and then headed the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation in 1996. In 1999, Mayor Dinkins asked Wright to join Carver Bancorp as President and CEO. Wright says of Carver, â€œThe black banking industryâ€¦really comes out of an era of segregationâ€¦ But that was then, and now is now...â€ Watch Skiddyâ€™s interview with Deborah Wright below or visit OneWire to watch more videos from the Open Door series, including interviews with executives such as Tony James, President and COO of Blackstone, and Bill Comfort, Former Chairman of Citigroup Venture Capital. 
FacebookOne of our favorite  strategists, Hajime Kitano, is back in business. Kitano has been silent for several months following his resignation from JPMorgan as Chief Japan Equity Strategist in late January. At the time, the Japanese revival was quickly becoming the biggest economic story in the world, and his absence from the conversation struck us as unfortunate. Kitano landed at Morgan Stanley this month, though, and we're thrilled to see that he's back to cranking out fresh analysis of Japanese markets. The big question about Japan this week is what to make of the spike in Japanese government bond yields in recent trading sessions. In a note to Morgan Stanley clients today – titled "Quick Comment: What to Make of the Sharp Rise in Interest Rates?" – Kitano points out that the recent spike in yields puts Japanese markets in "unfamiliar territory," the likes of which haven't been seen in nearly 20 years. Typical of Kitano's style, the note begins with a critique of Japanese press coverage of financial markets: "The May 16 Nikkei carries a report at the top of its front page entitled ‘Broadening of investors in Japanese stocks.’ The subtitle is ‘Funds shift from bonds.’" Great Rotation, anyone? (One of the goals of Japan's monetary stimulus is to lower government bond yields to levels where they are no longer attractive to investors, such that they will sell their bonds and move into riskier assets like stocks.) What's new, though, is the behavior of the relationship between Japanese stocks and bond yields: the typically positive correlation has now gone negative for the first time since 1995. In other words, stocks and bonds are now rising in tandem, and investors looking for a Japan-style "Great Rotation" ought to take that into account. Here's Kitano: We cannot remember a time when interest rates have been considered a principal determining factor for the stock market. We think that Exhibit 3 makes this plain. In the case of Japan, the correlation coefficient between interest rates and the stock market (measured over three-year periods) had remained consistently positive. However, we think it is important to note that the correlation coefficient between these two series has now become negative in Japan’s case for the first time since 1995, following on from the same pattern occurring in the US from around 2011. We recommend investors to bear in mind that the financial markets are in unfamiliar territory. The chart below shows the change in correlations. Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley Research
REUTERS/Tony Gentile Pope Francis has attacked the “dictatorship” of the global financial system and warned that the “cult of money” was making life a misery for millions. He said free-market capitalism had created a “tyranny” and that human beings were being judged purely by their ability to consume goods. Money should be made to “serve” people, not to “rule” them, he said, calling for a more ethical financial system and curbs on financial speculation. Countries should impose more control over their economies and not allow “absolute autonomy”, in order to provide “for the common good”. The gap between rich and poor was growing and the “joy of life” was diminishing in many developed countries, the Argentinian Pope said, two months after he was elected as the successor to Benedict XVI. “While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority is crumbling,” said Francis, who as archbishop of Buenos Aires visited slums, opted to live in a modest flat rather than an opulent Church residence and went to work by bus. In poorer countries, people’s lives were becoming “undignified” and marked by violence and desperation, he said. Francis made the strongly-worded remarks in his first major speech on finance and the economy, during an address to foreign ambassadors in the Vatican. It underlined a reputation he has established in the last two months for showing deep concern for the plight of the poor and vulnerable. “The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly human goal,” Francis told the ambassadors. As the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, he often spoke out about the plight of the poor during the country’s economic crisis. Unchecked capitalism had created “a new, invisible, and at times virtual, tyranny”, said the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio. “The Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but the Pope has the duty, in Christ’s name, to remind the rich to help the poor, to respect them, to promote them,” he said. Francis will make the first foreign trip of his papacy to Brazil in July, during which he will visit a slum in Rio de Janeiro and meet young prison inmates.

May 15, 2013 Dhaka, Bangladesh The only English word my taxi driver knew was â€œshitâ€. And perhaps, given the state of his vehicle and road conditions, it was the most appropriate. I lost count of the number of pedestrians we nearly mowed down on the way from the airport; it was difficult to see anyhowâ€“ the shattered glass from the bullet hole in his windshield obscured my view.  This was no typical third world taxi ride. Becauseâ€¦ there are developing countries. And there are really poor countries. And then thereâ€™s Bangladesh â€“ a country so destitute it makes sub-Saharan Africa look wealthy by comparison. Bangladesh is so poor that the World Trade Organization has awarded it â€œLeast Developed Countryâ€ status. Itâ€™s a dubious honor thatâ€™s supposed to impart 100% duty free, quota-free access to â€˜richâ€™ countries like the United States. But even despite such incentives, the manufacturing sector is running far below its potential; the nearly constant social unrest and political stunts tend to scare away foreign investors. I saw this first hand as I spent the day exploring the city and meeting with locals â€“ not a single westerner to be seen outside of my hotel lobby. Spending time with bankers, brokers, and lawyers today, itâ€™s clear one of the major reasons why the country is so poor is because there is an utter lack of access to capital. Capital is the lifeblood of an economyâ€¦ and of business. Without it, neither can function. But Bangladeshâ€™s completely dysfunctional, government-dominated banking sector has nearly eliminated access to capital. Politicians make the worst bankers â€“ they wouldnâ€™t know a good deal if it hit them in the head. Just in the last quarter, in fact, default rates at the state-owned banks soared 40%. Meanwhile, small businesses and micro-enterprises are stuck without access to capital. I saw the effects of this while walking through a market today â€“ groups of metal workers were hammering away forging tools by hand, just like medieval blacksmiths.  They use technology from the Dark Ages because anything thatâ€™s remotely capital intensive just isnâ€™t possible with the current financial system here. This restrains productivity, production, growth, development â€¦ everything. And what you end up with is a GDP per capita thatâ€™s lower than even Myanmarâ€™s â€“ a country that has suffered from economic sanctions for more than a decade. The bright spot in Bangladesh is that private industry is starting to fix this. Private banks, for example, constitute the fastest growing portion of the financial sector. Their product offerings are superior, customer service better, and the banks are better managed and more highly capitalized. You may also be aware that Bangladesh is the epicenter of microfinance; just down the road from me is the Grameen Bank headquarters, the microfinance bank founded by Muhammad Yunnis that revolutionized the industry. These private-sector players are making a big dent in the government finance monopoly. And I expect that the flow of business credit will improve dramatically in the coming years. Bigger picture, this is a huge market. Bangladesh crams 160 million people into an area smaller than the state of Iowa. Itâ€™s dirt cheap. There are trade incentives. There are natural resources. Thereâ€™s a lot of turmoil and chaos at the moment. And best of all, itâ€™s practically off the radar. These are all great ingredients for an interesting long-term speculation. Iâ€™ll report back on what I find.  Read more posts on Sovereign Man Â»
APWal-Mart released earnings today and revealed that it's grappling with a slump in sales.  Sales rose 1% to $113 billion, falling below Wall Street's expectations.  The largest U.S. retailer blamed the miss on a slew of economic factors, including the payroll tax increase, tax refund delays, and even bad weather.  But the scary truth about Wal-Mart's customers?  They're broke, said Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital.  "They are still living paycheck to paycheck, something that's not captured in headline jobs numbers but is captured in weak wage growth," Sozzi said. "Bottom line here: Food and gas price deflation have not yet caused the Wal-Mart shopper to spend more during each trip." And the implications could be disturbing for the U.S. economy, writes Anne D'innocenzio at The Associated Press.  Wal-Mart "is considered an economic bellwether because the retailer accounts for nearly 10% of nonautomotive retail spending in the U.S.," she writes.  Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke acknowledged the retailer's customers were struggling because of the payroll tax hike in an interview with Women's Wear Daily last year.  “They are middle-class Americans and those aspiring to join the middle class,” Duke said. “Our customers are working hard to adapt to the ‘new normal,’ but their confidence is still very fragile. They are shopping for Christmas now and they don’t need uncertainty over a tax increase."
For the past three years, the market's valuation multiple has been held down by fears that a financial meltdown in Europe, a double-dip recession in the US, and a hard landing in China will cause a recession. Yesterday, the forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 rose to 14.4. That's the highest since April 23, 2010, just before Greece hit the fan and just before the bears became obsessed with their Endgame scenario triggered by growth-crushing woes in Europe, the US, and China. If the end of the Endgame is far off or if there is no end to the Endgame, then valuation multiples have been too low for the past three years and have room to move higher, which is what they are doing now. From this perspective, the recent valuation-led rally in stocks isn't irrational exuberance. Rather, it is a bullish rejection of the bearish and dreaded prediction of the Endgame prognosticators pontificating that the end is near or even imminent. The mean of the monthly forward P/E of the S&amp;P 500 since September 1978, when the data start, is 13.7. The recent valuation-led rally may simply be a reversion to the mean, as the P/E has rebounded from 12.1 at the end of last year on November 14 to 14.4 yesterday. The bull marketâ€™s trough P/E was actually 10.2 on October 3, 2011. The bull marketâ€™s peak P/E was 15.1 on October 14, 2009 before the bears distracted us with their Endgame scenario, which depressed P/Es. Reverting above the mean to 2009â€™s peak would put the S&amp;P 500 at 1744, up 5.2% from yesterdayâ€™s close. Â Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: MAMU? (1) If it looks like a melt-up, is it? (2) Sit back and relax? (3) It probably isnâ€™t different this time. (4) Valuation multiple could revert back above its mean. (5) Rule of 20 puts P/E at 18. (6) The fundamentals are mixed. (7) But bad news is good news. (8) Going vertical. (9) Fasten your seat belt. (10) The Mother of All Melt-Ups? (11) Greenspan's melt-up. (More for subscribers.)
REUTERS/Srdjan ZivulovicGold prices are down about 12.5% since the start of April. But global central banks have been increasing their reserves of the yellow metal. A new report from the World Gold Council shows that central banks bout 109 tonnes of gold in the first quarter. This was the seventh straight quarter in which they purchased over 100 tonnes of gold. Central banks held 31,735.4 tonnes of gold as of May 2013. This was up from 31,694.8 tonnes as of April 2013. Gold entered a bear market during that quarter.  In the current quarter, gold has gone from $1,603 on April 1 to below $1,400 today. According to the WGC, Russia and South Korea were among the biggest buyers of gold. “The price drop in April, fuelled by non-physical moves in the market, proved to be the catalyst for a surge of buying that has left many retailers short of stock and refineries introducing waiting lists for deliveries," said Marcus Grubb managing director at World Gold Council in a press release. "Putting this into context, sales of bars and coins, jewelery and consumption in the technology sector still make up 81% of the market. "What these figures show is that even before the events of April, the fundamentals of the gold market remain robust with; growing demand in India and China, central banks consistently adding gold to their reserves and strong buying of investment products such as gold bars and coins." Overall global demand for gold fell 19% on the quarter in Q1 to 963 tonnes.
APIt's the end of college graduation season, and across the country recent graduates are expected to listen to countless successful people as they give their parting advice in commencement speeches.Â  If you're not exactly relishing the thought of listening to a political has-been or B-level actor impart their wisdom while severely hungover, you're not alone. In fact, there's a very good statistical reason why you should probably take a healthy serving of salt with whatever you hear, and it's called survivor bias.Â  Survivor bias is a type of selection bias, where a study focuses on people that survived some process, overlooking those who didn't survive, which skews the results.Â  For an example of survivor bias from the finance industry, just look at mutual funds. From Investopedia: For example, a mutual fund company's selection of funds today will include only those that have been successful in the past. Many losing funds are closed and merged into other funds to hide poor performance.Â  It's the same reason that dating sites are able to say they have a higher success rate than they actually do â€” mostly because they pretend the quitters never joined â€” and that even though many mathematicians say Alice in Wonderland inspired a love of math, the book isn't a surefire way to mint a mathematician. Donald Trump moves a lot of paperbacks talking about his methods for success, but how many people can say they really struck it rich on real estate thanks to Donald Trump? How many can't? It's the same thing with people. For example, let's say you looked at 100 commencement speeches, 90% of which encouraged you to do as the speaker did and follow your dreams.Â  You might conclude then that following your dreams is a surefire way to succeed, as 9 in 10 very successful commencement speakers all encourage doing so.Â  But you've got a selection bias here. Since universities typically invite only successful people to speak at these events, you don't know several things, like the failure rate of all people who followed their dreams. For every Senator talking about their success in front of a bunch of college kids, there are lot of Amy's Baking Companies out thereÂ that followed their dreams but aren't invited to the commencement.. Â  This isn't to say that universities shouldn't invite successful people to speak at these events. Nor is it to say that all college addresses should be followed by a brief disclaimer that past performance is not indicative of future results. It's just worthwhile to remember that the skills that these people recommend aren't guarantees of success, and because being highly successful is by definition exceptional, they're probably the exception rather than the rule.
Earning a salary, working for someone else, is earning ‘fixed income,’ which means you hope it comes close to covering your lifestyle expenses.  Like all fixed income, however, it will be limited.  In the case of your salary, the limitation of your fixed income comes not from prevailing interest rates, but rather from the environment and decisions of people you work for. Did your company do well this year?  Did your boss decide you are one of her key employees?  Does your company expect to still need your labor and time in another year, or three?   If you can say yes to all three, then you can continue to earn your fixed income, otherwise known as a salary.  You cannot reasonably expect, however, anything above the minimum that your boss and company guesstimate will be enough to keep you around for as long as they need you.[1] Business ownership is Equity Owning and building a business feels completely different. Owning and building a business is earning ‘equity.’ Equity typically pays less in dividends than does fixed income.   It also pays less often.  Worse, equity has a nasty habit of losing value periodically.  Equity regularly goes to zero in value, which, if it’s your company, means you lost your investment and your business and your income all at the same time.  It’s also potentially more costly emotionally to lose your business equity than to lose the fixed income of your salary.  Despite this terrible feeling – I’m speaking from experience here — here’s the surprising part of my strongly held belief: Everyone in the for-profit world should aspire to build and run his or her own business. On entrepreneurship vs. working for a salary, my own journey During most of my college years I did not imagine a life in business, working for profit.  Truth be told, I dismissed working for profit, in my self-righteous college-kid way, as unworthy of serious consideration. After a few years of actually working for a living, however, I realized I enjoyed it much more than I had imagined I would.  It felt ‘real’ in a way that pure academia did not.  The teamwork involved in the companies I worked for, producing a service for which customers happily paid significant sums, seemed ‘real’ as well, in a way that was new and surprising to me. Once I decided making money was one of my goals, the next decision about working for a living became whether to work for myself or to work for someone else. Although I enjoyed working in the for-profit world, I got it into my head that I would rather own my own business rather than work for a salary for someone else. Please see next post on Entrepreneurship Part II – Ownership vs. Salary: lessons from finance And Entrepreneurship Part III – More differences between ownership and salary: Air, Taxes, Retirement [1] Of course I know of bosses who pay above the minimum amount to keep you around.  But these bosses are relatively rare and therefore remarkable.  Also, they are violating a rule of market efficiency by paying you more than is necessary to retain you.  If they persist in paying you more than necessary, another competitor can pay its employees less and undercut your employer.  Which is what makes overpaying for you unsustainable, in the long run.  You cannot expect it to last.
Target.comIn a new piece up at The New Republic, pundit Michael Kinsley defends the austerity crowd, the people who have been incorrectly arguing that spending cuts and deficit reduction should be a major priority for the economy. Kinsley ends his piece with this shot at Paul Krugman, who of course has been the biggest critic of austerity. When Krugman says heâ€™s only worried about â€œprematureâ€ fiscal discipline, it becomes largely a question of emphasis anyway. But the austerians deserve credit: They at least are talking about the spinach, while the Krugmanites are only talking about dessert. So Kinsley is saying that the problem with the economy is that we were bad and gorged ourselves on pie, and that now it's time to suffer a bit and eat some bland spinach. But this is nonsense. The economy is practically OD'ing on spinach. To Michael Kinsley, we present all the spinach that's being ingested. For example, there's the unemployment rate, which surged to virtually all-time highs. Is that not enough miserable spinach? FRED Then there's the explosion in people who are long-term unemployed. Is that not enough pain and misery? FRED Now remember, ground zero for the crisis was housing. Here's housing-prices (as measured by Case-Shiller) collapsing. Is that not enough payback for our gluttony? FRED If you're worried about people eating their dessert before the healthy stuff, then you were probably pretty alarmed by the rise of household debt. Lo and behold, household debt has been falling for the first time in history, and it continues to decline. FRED We could of course go on and on, but the point is clear: We're eating tons of spinach. Now give us our damn dessert!
APOne up on Wall Street.A year ago tomorrow, Facebook went public. It was one of the most breathlessly anticipated public offerings in history.  For years, people who knew nothing about Facebook or the stock market had been elbowing each other out of the way to try to get in on the action. Facebook was going to be "bigger than Google." Facebook's IPO was going to be an unprecedented free-money bonanza. All you had to do to win was play... (Those who warned that Facebook looked like overpriced "muppet bait," meanwhile, were dismissed as worrywarts who were just raining on the parade.) Facebook's stock priced at $38, opened at $40, and then, within 10 market hours after the pricing, tanked. Four months later, it bottomed at $18, and has now found some stability in the mid-$20s (where, at about 35X next year's projected earnings, it is still arguably expensive). For months after Facebook's IPO flop, pundits around the world howled about what a terrible outcome this was for the company, how Facebook's brand would be forever tarnished, how investors would always hate Facebook, how Facebook's young CEO had fatally blown it, how investors would never trust Wall Street again... Facebook insiders, meanwhile, pointed out that Facebook had merely accepted the price investors were willing to pay for its stock--and, in so doing, had avoided giving away billions of dollars in an overnight stock "pop" just so the press could write some hyperventilating headlines about how "successful" the IPO was. Facebook's IPO, the insiders pointed out, was highly successful: Facebook raised ~$10 billion of cash at an excellent price. And in accepting the market's "bid" for its stock, insiders also pointed out, Facebook had just done the same thing that any savvy house seller would have done--sell the house for the price the market was willing to pay. "But, NO!" roared the myopic market pundits, Facebook had SCREWED UP. Facebook had RUINED ITS ONE CHANCE WITH INVESTORS. Facebook had SEALED ITS FATE. And yet, a year later, except by those who had the misfortune of paying too high a price for the stock (who have now presumably learned an expensive but valuable lesson), Facebook's IPO has been completely forgotten. Now, Facebook is just another public company. Facebook is trading at a very healthy valuation (again, 35X next year's expected earnings). Facebook has already taken the opportunity to buy back some of its stock at a low level. Investors who bought Facebook's stock when it traded down to the teens are presumably quite happy. So it all worked out fine. (Those who defend the huge free-money IPO "pop" might suggest that Facebook's stock would be trading at a higher level today if it had given Wall Street a bigger gift a year ago--by, say, pricing the stock at $25 instead of $38. I disagree. I think the stock would be trading at exactly the same price today. Investors are quite good at exploiting "mispricings" in public stocks, and they don't care much about prior generosity. But this argument is unprovable and academic, so it's not worth spending much time on.) Importantly, by establishing up front that it wasn't going to just hand Wall Street free money, Facebook also set the precedent that it wasn't going to run the company with Wall Street's short-term screaming in mind. Unlike most companies, Facebook is aggressively investing for the long term, depressing its near-term earnings in the process. This aggressive investment no doubt infuriates some Wall Street fund managers, who probably feel that Facebook's only concern should be getting and keeping its stock price as high as possible.  But this aggressive investment, which most companies aren't bold enough to do, is likely giving Facebook a much better chance of creating a much more valuable company over the long haul. In other words, just as it did during the IPO, Facebook is keeping Wall Street in its place. It's looking out for Facebook and Facebook users and long-term Facebook investors, not just short-term Facebook traders. And its IPO "flop," which was slammed by almost every market pundit on earth, is now irrelevant. SEE ALSO: Facebook Is Doing Exactly The Right Thing -- Ignoring Wall Street
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Columbia University is seeking to change the terms of a 93-year-old trust earmarked for white students from Iowa. The Lydia C. Roberts Graduate Fellowship stipulates that money be given only to "a person of the Caucasian race" from Iowa. Roberts left Columbia most of her $509,000 estate when she died in 1920 and created the highly restrictive fellowship. It also stipulates that students must not study law, medicine, dentistry, veterinary surgery or theology. They also must move back to Iowa for a minimum of two years after graduating. Lucy Drotning, the university's associate provost, filed an affidavit in Manhattan state Supreme Court last week in support of a legal action initiated by the fund's administrator, JPMorgan Chase Bank, seeking to change the terms of the trust. Columbia hasn't awarded the fellowship since 1997 â€” but the school said it's impossible to know when exactly Columbia stopped adhering to the race-related terms of the gift. "Columbia long ago ceased awarding the fellowships in question and does not follow gift conditions that violate anti-discrimination laws," the university said in a statement Wednesday. "It should go without saying that a university rightly known for the great diversity of its student body is as offended as anyone by the requirements of these fellowships." The court papers ask for the whites-only provision to be thrown out and suggest a modification to the Iowa-only rule. The original trust is designated for graduate students who were born in Iowa and attended a college or university in Iowa. Columbia suggests in its affidavit that the stipulation could be modified so that fellowships could be awarded either to students who are residents of Iowa or to students who graduated from college there. According to the affidavit, the current value of the trust is $840,000, and it earned $26,000 in income in 2011. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Alessandro GarofaloThis morning's slew of bad ecpnomic data is being followed by a relatively modest sell-off in the markets. The Dow is down 12 points, the S&amp;P 500 is down just 3 points. Treasuries, however, are rallying as it appears money is seeking safety. Moments ago, we got the May reading of the Philly Fed Manufacturing survey. It unexpectedly plunged to -5.2 from 1.3 in April.Â  Economists were looking for the reading to climb to 2.0. "The number of firms reporting decreased activity this month (29 percent) edged out those reporting increased activity (24 percent)," said the Philly Fed.
There's virtually nobody left who credibly argues that austerity is a good remedy for a weak economy. But there is still some debate as to why, in the aftermath of the economic crisis, a number of smart people/business leaders/politics/etc. jumped aboard the austerity bandwagon, when the most conventional textbook economics said that that was a bad idea. In a recent New York Review of Books piece, Paul Krugman laid out his Grand Unified Theory, which is basically that people see a moral requirement of inducing pain to suffer for past sins. They view the collapse of the economy as some sign that we've been wicked, and that the only way to cure wickedness is to lash ourselves in the back. Now Dan Drezner at Foreign Policy points us to a bizarre "rebuttal" to Krugman in The New Republic by Michael Kinsley, which inadvertently proves all of Krugman's arguments that the austerians see the debate as being a moral question. This is an actual line from Kinsley: I donâ€™t think suffering is good, but I do believe that we have to pay a price for past sins, and the longer we put it off, the higher the price will be. The fact that Kinsley actually uses the word "sins" proves Krugman's point entirely, that what the Very Serious People of Washington DC think is that the suffering is the result of us being bad, and that what we need is punishment to absolve ourselves. Then the final line of Kinsley's piece does it again: When Krugman says heâ€™s only worried about â€œprematureâ€ fiscal discipline, it becomes largely a question of emphasis anyway. But the austerians deserve credit: They at least are talking about the spinach, while the Krugmanites are only talking about dessert. This is crazy talk. Krugman doesn't want dessert. He wants people to eat again. And the answer to get people eating is not: here, you get spinach (which is actually delicious, but code word for eating something miserable). So as Dan Drezner points out, Michael Kinsley has proved everything Krugman has argued about why people want spending cuts.
Wikimedia Commons The Philadelphia Fed's monthly Business Outlook Survey is out. The headline index plunged to -5.2 from last month's 1.3 reading. Economists were looking for a rise to 2.0. Below is the full text from the release: Manufacturing firms responding to the monthly Business Outlook Survey suggest that regional manufacturing activity weakened this month. All of the surveyâ€™s broadest current indicators were negative this month, indicating weaker conditions compared with April. The surveyâ€™s indicators of future activity improved, however, and suggest that firms expect overall growth over the next six months. The surveyâ€™s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion index of current activity, decreased from 1.3 in April to -5.2 this month. The current activity index has shown no pattern of sustained growth over the past seven months, generally alternating between positive and negative readings (see Chart). The number of firms reporting decreased activity this month (29 percent) edged out those reporting increased activity (24 percent). Other current indicators showed similar weakness this month. The demand for manufactured goods remained weak, with the current new orders index declining from -1.0 to -7.9. The shipments index also indicated weakness, decreasing more sharply from 9.1 to -8.5. Firms reported a notable increase in inventories this month: The current inventories index increased from -22.2 to 4.1. Labor market conditions showed continued weakness, with indexes suggesting lower employment overall. The employment index decreased 2 points toÂ -8.7, its second consecutive negative reading. The percentage of firms reporting employment decreases (22 percent) exceeded the percentage reporting increases (14 percent). The workweek index declined 10 points to -12.4, remaining negative for the fifth consecutive month. The surveyâ€™s price indexes suggest continued moderation in price pressures. With regard to purchased inputs, 18 percent of firms reported paying higher prices for inputs, while 11 percent reported lower input prices. The prices paid index edged 4 points higher than in April, which was its lowest reading since July 2009. The prices received index increased 4 points, to -3.3. The percentage of firms reporting lower prices for their own manufactured goods (10 percent) exceeded the percentage reporting higher prices (7 percent) for the fifth consecutive month. The surveyâ€™s future indicators suggest improved optimism among the reporting manufacturers. The future activity index increased from 19.5 to 32.3, returning to near its level in March (see Chart). The percentage of firms expecting increases in activity over the next six months (45 percent) exceeded the percentage expecting decreases (12 percent) by a significant margin. The indexes for future new orders and shipments also improved, increasing 10 and 5 points, respectively. The future employment index also improved, increasing 2 points, a more modest increase than the other broader future indicators. Twenty-four percent of firms expect increases in employment over the next six months; 14 percent expect decreases. In special questions this month, firms were asked about their current inventory situation (seeÂ Special Questions). About 58 percent of firms indicated that their inventories were about right for current conditions. On balance, inventories are expected to fall in the second quarter: Nearly 26 percent of firms expect inventories to fall; 8 percent expect them to rise. Firms perceived little change in their customersâ€™ inventory plans in recent months. The majority (54 percent) indicated no change in their customersâ€™ inventory plans, and the share reporting decreases (12 percent) was near the share reporting increases (8 percent). The May Business Outlook Survey indicates some weakening of activity this month, with all of the broad indicators recording negative diffusion indexes. The surveyâ€™s indicators have failed to exhibit any sustained pattern of growth in recent months. The indicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments suggest weaker conditions this month, and firms reported employment reductions. Price pressures continue to be modest. Despite weaker current indicators, firms continue to expect positive growth over the next six months. Click here for the full release &gt;
The Department of Education (DOE) has fined Yale University for failing to report serious sex crimes andÂ  endangering students who thought campus was safer than it really was. Yale didn't report four "forcible sex offenses" from 2001 and 2002, and the university failed to explain its policies for alerting students about crimes on campus. Under the Clery Act, any school whose students get federal financial aid have to report crimes on campus every year. The DOE noted that Yale has improved how it responds to sex crimes since the agency started looking into its Clery Act violations in 2007. However, the DOE also told Yale in a letter its failures to comply with Clery were "very serious and numerous." "These failures endangered Yale's students and employees who must be able to rely on the disclosures of campus crime statistics, policies, and statements, and the accurate reporting of crime statistics to take precautions for their safety," the DOE letter said. The DOE said it began scrutinizing Yale's Clery Act reports after its alumni magazine ran a piece in 2004 called "Lux, Veritas, and Sexual Trespass: How Yale College Investigates Sexual Harassment and Assault." The piece, written by journalist and Yale Law school graduate Emily Bazelon, suggested Yale had been seriously underreporting its sex crime statistics. Bazelon's piece points to the story of a Yale sophomore who was pinned down by a junior boy in a dorm room in 2001. She told him "stop" and "don't do this" while he masturbated on her. The sophomore eventually reported the assault to Yale's "sexual harassment grievance board," which approached the junior. He admitted the assault but Yale never reported it in its Clery report, according to Bazelon. This type of approach might have been why Yale had been reporting fewer sex offenses than any other Ivy League school, Bazelon noted. Yale reported five sex offenses between 2000 and 2002, while Harvard reported 80 from that same period and Princeton reported 29. Bazelon added: To students trying to raise awareness on campus, the tiny number of assaults that Yale reports is maddening. â€œThe dominant attitude is that rape doesnâ€™t happen here. And Yale University reports support that feeling,â€ wrote Della Sentilles â€™06 in the Yale Daily News last winter. â€œYale statistics seem misleading and Yale students are inadequately informed.â€ Yale reported 20 sex offenses in 2011 â€” so either the number is going up or the school is doing a better job of reporting its crime statistics. The university had this to say about the recent fine, according to the New Haven Register: Yale fully supports the Department of Educationâ€™s mandate under the Clery Act and believes that student safety is of paramount importance. The university is fully committed to maintaining a robust program of campus security policies and campus crime statistics reporting that contains all of the elements prescribed by the Clery Act. Yale added, though, that the "imposition of maximum fines is not warranted" for violations from so many years ago.
Legendary Las Vegas hotelier Kirk Kerkorian's ex-wife says that he's being held hostage by managers of his holding company, Tracinda Corp, TMZ reports. In Court documents, Lisa Kerkorian says that Kirk hasn't been seen in public since June 2012 — not even to occupy his regular lunch table at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She fears his managers are controlling him, and separating him from their daughter, Kira. From TMZ: Lisa and Kirk were possibly in the nastiest celebrity divorce in Hollywood history, yet now Lisa has gone to court on behalf of her daughter to seek the appointment of a conservator to manage Kirk's affairs and pave the way to re-establish a relationship between Kirk and Kira... And one more twist ... Kira isn't even Kirk's biological daughter, but he raised her as his own. A rep for Tracinda tells TMZ, "There are no facts to support Bonder’s claims and therefore no merit whatsoever to the allegations she has made." The billionaire and former owner of MGM Studios is 95, and is the 412th richest person in the world, according to Forbes. He started out in the world of Las Vegas casinos in 1962 after purchasing 80 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip. He bought MGM in 1968.
flickr/Anton BaderThe stock market is on an absolute hot streak right now. Not only is it sitting at an all-time high, it also hasn't seen a notable pullback in at least 179 days. Furthermore, it's closed positively for 18 straight Tuesdays. However, Art Cashin warns that we should be careful about patterns we may or may not see in the markets. Cashin, a member of Mensa and UBS's man on the New York Stock Exchange floor, shares a tale of how correlation was once confused for causality. "As the debate about what may, or may not, have caused the highly unusual string of eighteen straight "up Tuesdays", it is worth reviewing the human affinity for seeking and finding patterns around us," he writes. From this morning's Cashin's Comment: Sometimes our search for patterns and causes can lead us astray, occasionally with a humorous result.  Here's a tale of such a search from the London Economist back in early 2004: To be fair, statistics can be deceptive, especially when explaining human behaviour, which is necessarily complicated, and to which iron laws do not apply.  Moreover, even if a relationship exists, the wrong conclusions can be drawn.  In medieval Holland, it was noted that there was a correlation between the number of storks living on the roof of a house and number of children born within it.  The relationship was so striking that, according to the rules of maths that govern such things, you could say with great confidence that the results were very unlikely to be merely random.  Such a relationship is said to be “statistically significant”.  But the Dutch folklore of the time that storks somehow increased human fertility was clearly wrong. Intriguingly, although the stork barometer of babydom was dismissed hundreds of years ago, the stork association with new babies lives on.  Error dies hard, especially in the stock market. We hope to return to man's innate search for patterns and potential causality – as well as the Tuesday phenomenon – in coming days. Cashin notes that we're hardwired to recognized patterns.  However, he can't reiterate enough that we should be careful not to mistake correlation for causation.
APJimmy CayneBloomberg's Max Abelson and Nick Summers have a Businessweek cover story "DIMON IS FOREVER. Why Jamie Dimon Is Wall Street's Indispensable Man" ahead of the big vote over whether or not to separate the roles of CEO and chairman.   For the story, Bloomberg caught up with Jimmy Cayne, the former CEO of now-defunct Bear Stearns, for a rare interview since JPMorgan acquired his old bank.   Cayne explains that all of Dimon's critics, who have been pushing to split his role chairman/CEO, are just jealous because he's got everything going on for him that they don't.  From Businessweek:  "They’re jealous," former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne says about Dimon’s critics, in a rare interview since JPMorgan bought the foundering investment bank in March 2008. “’They’re looking at themselves as being unfortunate and being underpaid and being underappreciated, and if there’s a piñata out there to take a swipe at, who better than somebody who’s got everything that they don’t?'” But that's not all Cayne had to say. He also told Bloomberg Businessweek that the critics are basically haters. "They’re likely to have an awful lot of bad things to say about either him, or Ronald Reagan, or anybody," Cayne said in the interview with Bloomberg.
YouTube / Margin Call TrailerS&amp;P 500 futures are tumbling and Treasuries are catching a bid in the wake of three weaker-than-expected economic data releases that all came out at 8:30 AM ET. S&amp;P 500 futures are trading around 1651 versus levels around 1656.5 prior to the releases, and are now down 0.2% from yesterday's close. 30-year Treasury futures, on the other hand, spiked to levels around 144'30 from around 143'30 prior to the releases, and are now up about 0.5% on the day. The Japanese yen spiked from levels around 102.60 against the U.S. dollar prior to the releases to around 102.20, confirming the small bout of "risk off" caused by the three releases. Consumer prices fell 0.4% in April from the previous month, worse than the 0.3% decline predicted by economists. Initial jobless claims surged to 360,000 in the week ended May 11 from 328,000 in the previous week. Economists were looking for 330,000. Housing starts in April were 853,000 at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, down substantially from the 1.021 million pace recorded in March and below estimates for a smaller drop to 970,000.
Minutes ago, we got the April reading of consumer prices. Not only did the numbers reflect a complete absence of inflation, they also showed that economists continue to overestimate inflation. Headline CPI fell by 0.4% which was more than the 0.3% decline expected.Â  This was largely due to the drop in energy prices. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, climbed by just 0.1%, which was also more modest than the 0.2 % expected. "The big story this year is not the US spending sequester, the China slowdown or the ongoing European recession," said Ethan Harris, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's top global economist. "The big story is inflation, or more precisely, the lack thereof." "The weakness has come as a surprise to economic forecasters and an even bigger surprise to many market participants. Critics of the major central banks have repeatedly warned that easy policy would lead to runaway inflation. However, in reality inflation is falling, not rising." Here's a chart of of BAML's global inflation surprise index.Â  Is you can see, inflation has been surprising economists to the downside all around the world. Business Insider
Reuters/ Joshua RobertsReuters's Laura Tara LaCapra reports that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie visited Goldman Sachs' 200 West Street headquarters yesterday for a conference. Â  It seems like the Republican governor may have mistaken a bald Goldman employee for the bank's CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Â  From Reuters:Â (emphasis ours) Christie, whoÂ filed papersÂ last yearÂ to run for re-election in 2014,Â recently announced that he had gastric bypass surgeryÂ to deal with his weight problem and he was looking in good spirits on Wednesday. He had a thick security detail and shook hands with a guy who, from behind, looked like Lloyd Blankfein but turned out not to be. He buttoned his jacket and waved to onlookers on his way into 200 West Street. Good for that guy, though.Â 
Flickr/ United Nations PhotoWelp! It still remains an open question whether the economy is hitting escape velocity, or whether the sequester and everything else are dragging it back down. Today we get more evidence that growth is sputtering. Initial jobless claims jumped from 328,000 to 360,000, a number that was far worse than the 330,000 that economists were expecting. Housing starts missed big, in part thanks to a huge drop in multi-family. The total sequential drop was 16.5%. And then finally we got a soft CPI report, which is a double-edge sword. It's good in that drops in food and gas prices are great for consumers, and are indeed one of the big economic tailwinds. But for a Fed that sees slack inflation as a sign of mediocre demand, it means goals aren't being achieved. And it means any "tapering" of easing may come a bit later than expected. The dollar is weakening on this news.
AP Photo/Matt YorkHousing starts fell 16.5% month-over-month (MoM) to an annualized rate of 853,000 units in April. This missed economists' expectations for a 6.4% fall to an annualized rate of 970,000 units. Last month's data was revised down to show a 5.4% increase to 1.02 million units. Building permits beat expectations surging 14.3% MoM to an annualized 1.01 million units. Economists were looking for a 3.8% rise to an annualized 941,000 units. Last month's reading was revised down to show 6.5% fall to 890,000 units. On Wednesday we got homebuilder confidence,Â considered a leading indicator for housing starts, specifically permits. That rose to 44 in May, from 41. "While the headline was disappointing the â€œmore normalâ€ reading for housing starts was confirmed by a sizable pick-up in building permit issuance," according to Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co. "You have to look back to June 2008 to find a month in which permit applications exceeded one million. The surge in April to 1.017 million rests comfortably with this weekâ€™s rise in confidence as reported by the NAHB survey." Ahead of the release Morgan Stanley said housing starts have "troughed" and are now on a "well-defined uptrend:" Morgan Stanley
Last week's initial jobless claims data are out. Initial claims spiked to 360,000 for the week ended May 11, above economists' estimate for 330,000 and the previous week's 328,000 figure, which was revised up from 323,000. Continuing claims fell to 3.009 million in the week ended May 4 from an upwardly-revised 3.013 million the week before. Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson commented on the data in an email to clients following the release: The jump in initial weekly jobless claims to 360,000 is out of the blue, especially since we felt that the blue-patch for the labor market was confined to March and early April. Weekly claims had been projected to rise by 7k to 330k, but in the event surged by 32k to a six-week high of 360k. The Labor Department said that no states provided explanations for the increase and that it did not have to estimate data for any states. At this point, we have to say that while disappointed, this reading is simply one data point and we have learned over time to expect outliers running against the bigger trend once in a while. We should also point out that although theÂ EmpireÂ StateÂ reading was poor yesterday, the labor component still signified advancing health for the labor market. Click here for the full release &gt;
Orin Zebest on FlickrApril consumer prices data are out. The headline index of prices fell 0.4% in April from the previous month, more than the 0.3% decline predicted by economists.

REUTERS/Rick WilkingS&amp;P has just downgraded the credit rating of Berkshire Hathaway to AA from AA+*. Berkshire Hathaway is the financial and industrial conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett. "The lower credit rating on BRK better reflects our view of BRK's dependence on its core insurance operations for most of its dividend income," said S&amp;P credit analyst John Iten. "BRK's adjusted leverage and coverage metrics are more consistent with those of 'AA' rated issuers rated under our comparable corporate criteria." S&amp;P is maintaining a negative outlook on the company. Earlier this month, Berkshire announced Q1 operating earnings of $2,302 per share, up from $1,615 a year ago.Â  This was well ahead of the $1,995 analysts were looking for. Berkshire also has a large long-term position on the global stock markets through derivatives, which earned the company $1.2 billion during the quarter. *NOTE: Earlier we wrote that Berkshire was downgraded to AA+ from AA. Here's the press release from S&amp;P: NEW YORK (Standard &amp; Poor's) May 16, 2013--Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that it has lowered its counterparty credit rating on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK; AA/Negative/A-1+) by one notch to 'AA' from 'AA+' and affirmed its 'AA+' insurance financial strength ratings on BRK's core subsidiaries following release of our revised Insurers Rating and Group Rating Methodology, released on May 7, 2013. The outlook on all ratings is negative. At the same time, we assigned our 'AA' senior debt rating to Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corp.'s (BHFC) $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes. BHFC has issued the notes in two tranches: $500 million 1.3% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2018, and $500 million 4.3% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2043. The company used the proceeds of this issue to repay $1.0 billion of senior notes maturing on May 15, 2013. BRK fully guarantees BHFC's new note issuance. BHFC's borrowings are used to fund the finance operations of Vanderbilt Mortgage &amp; Finance Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Clayton Homes Inc., a vertically integrated manufactured housing company. We treat these borrowings as operating leverage, so we exclude the debt, interest expense, and pretax operating income of these operations from our calculations of financial leverage and coverage for BRK. "The lower credit rating on BRK better reflects our view of BRK's dependence on its core insurance operations for most of its dividend income," said Standard &amp; Poor's credit analyst John Iten. Its non-insurance business segments generate a majority of BRK's operating income, but aside from the insurance subsidiaries only Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC (BNSF) has provided a significant portion of the total dividends paid from the operating companies to the holding company. BRK's adjusted leverage and coverage metrics are more consistent with those of 'AA' rated issuers rated under our comparable corporate criteria. The ratings reflect our view of BRK's excellent business risk profile (BRP) and very strong financial risk profile, built on an extremely strong competitive position and very strong capital and earnings. These factors are offset to some extent by BRK's high tolerance for equity investments, which has resulted in volatility in the company's insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital, capital adequacy of the insurance operations being less than what we typically expect for the rating category, and adequate enterprise risk management. Management succession at BRK is also an offsetting factor. We assess a one-notch uplift to the BRP to reflect our view of the low-risk nature of its non-insurance operations, which comprise approximately 60% to 70% of total earnings. In addition, we apply a holistic adjustment because BRK, on a consolidated basis, continues to outperform its insurance and non-insurance peers with respect to operating and financial performance, such as underwriting and cash-flow generation. For first-quarter 2013, pretax operating income was $5.9 billion, up 36% from the same quarter in 2012, with most of the improvement stemming from the insurance segment of BRK. Shareholders' equity rose to $198.1 million from $187.6 million as of year-end 2012, mostly driven by $5 billion of net income in the quarter and the appreciation of unaffiliated equity securities. The outlook is negative for two reasons. One is the sovereign rating cap of 'AA+/Negative', which applies to the obligations of the U.S. government, government-related enterprises, and U.S. financial services firms. The second reason is that we could lower the rating if the capital adequacy according to our capital model of BRK's insurance operations relative to its risk profile deteriorates as a result of a material increase in investment risk exposure or the funding of a large acquisition by the insurance companies. The negative outlook reflects our sovereign rating cap and our view on the group's capital adequacy per our proprietary capital model. We also expect the group to maintain operating performance consistent with our base-case scenario, and at least a very strong competitive position.

Reuters/Stephen LamTesla Motors is one of the most extraordinary business success stories in recent decades, in part because it has accomplished what no other American company has accomplished in more than half a century: Become a viable new car company. One of the main reasons the company has succeeded is because of the vision, determination, and, well, balls, of the man at the helm, entrepreneur Elon Musk. Many successful companies arrive at success only after going through near-death experiences, and Tesla went through one in 2008. In 2008, with the global economy melting down, Tesla was behind in delivering its first car, and the company was having trouble raising the additional capital it needed to stay afloat.Â  Musk was personally in okay shape, thanks to earlier successes with PayPal and other companies, but he couldn't stand the thought that his latest project was going to go bust. So he took his "last $35 million" of cash, as he later described it, and doubled down on Tesla. Five years later, Musk's stake in the now-profitable Tesla is worth about $2.5 billion. And Musk is still swinging for the fences. Tesla has decided to use its skyrocketing stock price to go on the offensive. The company will sell stock to repay the money it borrowed from the government. And one of the big buyers of that stock will be Elon Musk. Musk will plow another $100 million into Tesla stock. Even he apparently does not have this money just sitting around, so he's going to borrow it from Goldman Sachs. This new loan, of $150 million, will be added to Musk's existing tab at Goldman of $125 million. So, after the deal, Musk will owe Goldman $275 million. The loans will be secured by Musk's other assets, which include his stake in Tesla and stakes in companies like SpaceX. Relative to Musk's $2.5 billion of stock in Tesla, a $275 million loan is chump change. But if Tesla were to stumble and go bankrupt, as car companies occasionally do? Well, then, depending on the health of Musk's other ventures, that $275 million might look like a big number. Many entrepreneurs are celebrated for their "risk-taking," but aside from quitting safe jobs to start companies, many entrepreneurs actually don't take that much personal financial risk. Elon Musk does. And his willingness to take that risk, especially back in 2008, is a big reason Tesla is succeeding today. UPDATE: A sharp reader points out that something else is also going on here, namely that Tesla is using the capital it raises in the deal to pay off its government debt--and that that debt requires Musk to maintain more than 65% ownership of Tesla. By putting some money where his mouth is, Musk is arguably increasing investor confidence in Tesla, which will make it easier for the company to raise capital at a high price. And by paying off the government debt, Musk is also "unlocking" his stake in the company, which can now be sold. So that actually reduces Musk's risk somewhat. Here's the description of Musk's loans from Goldman, as noted by CNBC's Herb Greenberg: Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., has made extensions of credit in the aggregate amount of $125 million to Elon Musk and the Elon Musk Revocable Trust dated JulyÂ 22, 2003, or the Trust, a portion of the proceeds of which Mr. Musk used to purchase our common stock. Goldman Sachs Bank USA has agreed to make additional extensions of credit in an aggregate amount of $150 million to Elon Musk and the Trust, which together with the currently outstanding $125Â million would total $275 million. Mr. Musk will pay the purchase price for up to 540,605 shares of common stock he has indicated a preliminary interest in purchasing in this offering and the 660,740Â shares of our common stock being purchased in a subsequent private placement with a portion of the proceeds of these additional extensions of credit to be made by Goldman Sachs Bank USA. Interest on these loans accrue at market rates. Goldman Sachs Bank USA received and will receive customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans. As a regulated entity, Goldman Sachs Bank USA makes decisions regarding making and managing its loans independent of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. We are not party to these loans, which are full recourse against Mr. Musk and the Trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust. The terms of these loans were negotiated directly between Mr. Musk and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. SEE ALSO: The Tesla Story

iamlemonfilm on FlickrWalmart's Q1 financial results are out. Earnings per share came in at $1.14 per share, which was right in line with expectations. However, sales are looking weak. Comparable store sales excluding fuel fell by 1.4%. Analysts were looking for a 0.1% decline. "Comp sales performance was impacted by a delay in income tax refund checks, challenging weather conditions, less grocery inflation than expected and the payroll tax increase," said management.Â  "Walmart U.S. gained market share in the measured category of "food, consumables and health &amp; wellness/OTC." "In a quarter marked by considerable headwinds to top line sales, Walmart delivered solid EPS growth of 4.6 percent," said CEO Mike Duke. "Walmart's mission is simple and focused -- to help people save money so they can live better. When we simplify and focus our execution against this mission, it's easy for our associates to prioritize what they have to do to serve our customers." The stock is down slightly in pre-market trading. "Given current business and economic trends, including currency, we expect second quarter EPS to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.27," said CFO Charles Holley. "Investments in Global eCommerce initiatives were forecast to have an incremental $0.09 impact for fiscal 2014, and this remains in our guidance. We expect the Q2 impact to be in line with the $0.02 per share we had in the first quarter. In addition to eCommerce initiatives, expenses related to FCPA matters are expected to range from $65 to $70 million for the second quarter."
There have been a litany of articles written recently discussing how the stock market is set for a continued bull rally.Â  The are some primary points that are common threads among each of these articles which are that interest rates are low, corporate profitability is high and the Fed's monetary programs continue to put a floor under stocks.Â  The problem is that while I do not disagree with any of those points - they are all artificially influenced by outside factors. Â  Interest rates are low because of the Federal Reserve's actions, corporate profitability is high due to accounting rule changes following the financial crisis and the Fed is pumping money directly into the stock market as I discussed yesterday: The stock market has rallied sharply in direct correlation to the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet yet economic growth has floundered much to the dismay of the Federal Reserve.Â  As IÂ discussed recently: "The increases in excess reserves, which the banks can borrow for effectively zero, have been funneled directly into risky assets in order to create returns.Â  This is why there is such a high correlation, roughly 85%, between the increases in the Fed's balance sheet and the return of the stock market."  With this in mind I do have a few questions that would like to ask in order to stimulate your thinking? Employment Employment is the life blood of the economy.Â  Individuals cannot consume goods and services if they do not have a job from which they can derive income.Â  Therefore, in order for individuals to consume at a rate to provide for sustainable, organic (non-Fed supported), economic growth they must be employed at a level that provides a sustainable living wage above poverty level.Â  This means full-time employment that provides benefits and a livable wage.Â Â  The chart below shows the number of full-time employees relative to the population.Â  I have also overlaid jobless claims (inverted scale) that shows despite media headlines to the contrary - falling jobless claims does not mean improving employment.  Question:Â  Does the current level of employment support the current rise in asset prices? Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Following through from employment; once individuals receive their paycheck they then must consume goods and services in order to live.Â  Personal Consumption Expenditures is a measure of that consumption and comprises more than 70% of GDP currently. PCE is also the direct contributor to the sales of corporations which generates their gross revenue.Â  So goes personal consumption - so goes revenue.Â  The lower the revenue that comes into companies the more inclined businesses are to cut costs, including employment, to maintain profit margins.Â  The chart below is a comparison of the annualized change in PCE to the S&amp;P 500 index.Â  Notice the current divergence of the index from PCE.  Question: Does the current weakness in PCE support the current rise in asset prices? Import / Export Prices As we continue to "follow the money" it is important to review what corporations are receiving for the goods and services that are being exported as well as what they are paying for goods and services being imported.Â  More than 40% of corporate profits today come from the exports of goods and services.Â  Therefore, declines in prices received from exported goods directly affect profit margins.Â  However, declines in prices of imported goods and services are a positive for profitability.Â  The chart below looks as the difference between export and import prices.Â Â  When net prices are rising that is a positive for profitability, again at the top line of the income statement, and a negative when they are falling.  Question:Â  Are very negative net export prices supportive of the current market? Corporate Profits As % Of GDP Following the corporate profit story we can look directly at corporate profits.Â  Companies are currently at the highest level of profitability in history and is one of the key stories behind the "ongoing bull market" premise.Â  However, that profitability has come at the expense of "Main Street" as employment and wages have not risen.Â  I have discussed this recently stating: "Suppressed wage growth, layoffs, cost-cutting, productivity increases, accounting gimmickry and stock buybacks have been the primary factors in surging profitability. However, these actions are finite in nature and inevitably it will come down to topline revenue growth. However, since consumer incomes have been cannibalized by suppressed wages and interest rates - there is nowhere left to generate further sales gains from in excess of population growth."  The decline in economic growth epitomizes the problem that corporations face today in trying to maintain profitability.Â  The chart below show corporate profits as a percentage of GDP relative to the annual change in GDP.Â  As you will see the last time that corporate profits diverged from GDP it was unable to sustain that divergence for long.  Question:Â  How long can corporate profits remain diverged from weakening economic growth?Â  Margin Debt Vs. Junk Bond Yields As stated above the Federal Reserve's expansion of the balance sheet has investors ignoring the underlying fundamentals as asset prices rise with reckless abandon.Â  The complete lack of "fear" in the markets combined with a "chase for yield" has driven "risk" assets to record levels with stocks at all-time highs and junk bonds sporting record low yields.Â  This has been amplified as investors have taken on ever increasing levels of leverage. Â  The chart below shows the relationship between margin debt (leverage) and junk bond yields.Â  Margin on stocks is at levels last seen at the peak of the market in 2008 with yields on junk bonds at levels at levels never before witnessed.Â  This didn't end well last time as the reversion in the assets triggered repeated margin calls leading to a cycle of forced liquidations. Â   Question:Â  What is the possibility of this divergence being maintained indefinitely? Being bullish on the market in the short term is fine - you should be.Â  The expansion of the Fed's balance sheet will continue to push stocks higher as long as no other crisis presents itself.Â Â  However, the problem is that a crisis, which is ALWAYS unexpected, inevitably will trigger a reversion back to the fundamentals.Â  As I stated in "Clues To Watch For The End Of QE Infinity":Â  "...with margin debt at historically high levels when the 'herd' begins to turn it will not be a slow and methodical process but rather a stampede with little regard to valuation or fundamental measures. As prices decline it will trigger margin calls which will induce more indiscriminate selling. The vicious cycle will repeat until margin levels are cleared and selling is exhausted. The reality is that the stock market is extremely vulnerable to a sharp correction. Currently, complacency is near record levels and no one sees a severe market retracement as a possibility. The common belief is that there is 'no bubble' in assets and the Federal Reserve has everything under control." Take a moment to compare what you have heard, and read, with the questions presented here.Â  Draw your own conclusions and invest appropriately. 
BloombergTVMichael NovogratzMichael Novogratz, the head of Fortress Investment Group, appeared on CNBC yesterday. Among other things, he talked about what he considered to be an ongoing bubble in art. "Art is 100 percent a bubbleâ€”I mean it has all the markings for a bubble," said Novogratz. "Prices have gone parabolic. You go to any of the art shows and you know even the cheap stuff that was $10,000 two years ago is now $80,000." Novogratz and the CNBC crew were responding to a story on the recent Sotheby's auction where Barnett Newman's "Onement VI" sold for a stagger $43.8 million. "These $90 million paintings, you know, they might be worth eight one day," added Novogratz. "They won't go from 90 to 70, it will go from 90 to eight." Investors skeptical of traditional financial assets have flocked to alternative assets like art and gems in their efforts to store their wealth.

Flickr / CIMMYTGoldman Sachs forecast a hefty 13 percent decline in agricultural commodity returns over the next year, with prices pushed down by bumper harvests in both the U.S. and Latin America. (Read More: Deere Profit Beats, but Warns on Gathering Storms) "On the bearish side, we are forecasting a 13 percent 12-month return in agriculture," said Goldman analysts in a "Commodity Watch" research note on Tuesday. "This is being driven by the increasing likelihood of a significant rebound in inventories, on the combination of a realized record-large Latin American harvest, already making its way on the export market and helping rebuild depleted inventories, as well as prospects for record large U.S. production." (Read More: Latin American Hot Spots Lure Investors) The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that 14.1 billion bushels of corn will be harvested in the U.S. this year, well above the previous record of 13.1 billion in 2009. As of Monday however, only 28 percent of the expected crop had been planted. (Read More: Corn Crop Planting At Third Slowest Pace in Three Decades) U.S. farmers achieved one of their most profitable years on record in 2012, with farm commodity prices boosted by a lengthy and severe drought that constrained supply. In April 2013, around half of the country remained in drought, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, down from 65 percent the previous year. (Read More: Drought Worsens, Scorching Much of the Country)  Corn traded at about $6.50 per bushel on Wednesday, up more than 20 percent from a year ago. However, Goldman Sachs said that only a second major weather shock could keep crop prices at these levels. "While weather remains key to our outlook, with a large increase in U.S. planting required in coming weeks for this base case scenario to play out, it is important to emphasize that we believe the record-large realized South American harvest and the current weak level of global consumption requires another major weather shock in the U.S. this summer to keep crop prices near their current levels," the analysts wrote. Despite the very bearish stance on agricultural commodities, Goldman maintained its neutral outlook on commodities overall. It forecast commodity returns of 0.1 percent in the near-term, and 1.6 percent over the next 12 months. "Later this year, and into 2014, we expect accelerating economic growth to tighten commodity markets more broadly, likely creating better opportunities for investors to benefit from higher roll yields," Goldman Sachs said in the note.  â€”By CNBC's Katy Barnato  Correction:This story was updated to reflect that corn was trading at about $6.50 a bushel on Wednesday.
REUTERS/Lyle Stafford Economists have been debating whether Canada's housing market was in a bubble and when that bubble would burst. In a new report, British Columbia-based Pacifica Partners Capital Management asserts that question is missing some much scarier stuff going on up north. Yes, housing is now in decline after largely avoiding the 2008 shock, they say. But everything else has also been going haywire: unemployment, credit, stocks, etc.  That is all the more remarkable, they argue, because Canada emerged from the 2008 crisis appearing a paragon of stability in the world. Pacifica quotes Horace to sum up the situation: "Many shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor."  "A pronounced shift in both Canadian and US economies has taken place," write Pacifica's analysts. "The Canadian economy, once the envy of Americans, Europeans, and others, is now widely viewed as a commodity dependent, “one trick pony”.  In a series of charts we've reproduced here, Pacifica shows how a "mean reversion" is taking place in North America, with the U.S. economy recovering while Canada's is for a world of hurt.
Many skeptics of the Fed’s bond buying policy point to the bond market shellacking of 1994. That year, 10-year rates rose to 7.8% from 5.5% when the Fed started cranking up rates. They worry about a repeat as Team Bernanke winds down the current QE program. But JPMorgan isn’t so concerned: The prospect that the Fed may taper the pace of its asset purchases later this year has raised some concern that long-term interest rates could experience a 1994- like outcome, a year in which 10-year Treasury rates climbed 200bp. This concern has become so great that Chairman Bernanke even addressed it in a speech in early March. However, we believe there is limited risk that a tapering of asset purchases would produce an unwanted or accidental tightening in financial conditions at odds with the Fed’s macroeconomic objectives. … The expected QE coefficient shows that every $10bn in Fed purchases depresses 10-year yields by approximately 3.3bp; ...therefore, tapering Fed asset purchases from $85bn down to $0bn should cause 10-year yields to increase by 25-30bp. JP Morgan via James Pethokoukis Also note that unemployment fell from 6.5% to 5.5% and GDP rose by 4.1%. Bad year for bond investors, not so much for everyone else.

Germany's DAX is down 0.4%. Spain's IBEX is down 0.4% Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.4%. It's pretty quiet in Europe in terms of market moving economic news. All of this comes in the wake of a big GDP report in Japan where Abenomics appeared to have caused the economy to surge by 3.5% year-over-year in Q1.Â  Economists were looking for a 2.8% growth rate. Yesterday, European stocks closed at their highest levels since June 2008. It's worth noting that gold is getting slammed again, falling by $22 per ounce today.
Part of my job involves putting myself out on a limb at times, and I have taken the risk of being subject to contrary (sometimes enthusiastically so) viewpoints. Iâ€™ve even been accused of being too optimistic about emerging markets, perhaps partly because my views often represent a stark contrast to dramatic news headlines. So when I took a look at the findings of Franklin Templeton Investmentsâ€™ 2013 Global Investor Sentiment Survey (GISS),1 I was pleased to discover my longstanding optimism about emerging markets seems to be spreading among investors. According to the GISS survey, investors residing in emerging markets are more upbeat about their prospects this year and in the next 10 years than those in developed markets. Of special interest to me among the surveyâ€™s findings was that many investors seem to be at least recognizing the merit of investing globally, even if the bulk of their investment dollars stayed close to home. It still looks like most plan to keep the majority of their assets in their local markets (a â€œhome countryâ€ bias), but many report they plan to up their allocations into other markets, including emerging markets. According to the GISS, 58% of investors residing in developed markets believe their local stock market will be up this year, but investors in emerging markets were even more upbeat â€“ 66% believed their local stock market would post a bullish performance in 2013. Â Similarly, investors residing in emerging markets expected higher returns on their investments, with an average return expectation of 12% this year and 18% over the next 10 years. Those in developed markets expected a 7% average return in 2013, and 10% over the next 10 years. I find that noteworthy as growth rates in emerging markets are also expected to be generally higher than in developed markets this year, although stock market returns donâ€™t always directly correlate with growth rates. In addition, we believe the easy monetary policies of central banks globally could drive more assets into emerging markets. We think there are reasons to be encouraged that the bullish trends weâ€™ve seen overall in emerging markets over the past decade could continue. Knowing that market sentiment can play a role in market direction, positive sentiment in the emerging markets just may be one of those reasons. Of course, not every year is going to be a stellar year for emerging markets, and there will inevitably be periods of underperformance vs. developed markets. The Fundamental Story â€“ Growth  As Iâ€™ve noted before, if you look at the fundamentals, the growth rate of emerging markets in general last year bettered that of developed markets, and forecasters expect that to be the case again in 2013. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects GDP growth on average at 5.3% this year in emerging/developing economies generally, versus 1.2% in developed/ advanced economies generally.2 We anticipate this type of overall trend could likely be mirrored in coming years, too, and we believe emerging markets in Asia and Africa look to have particular potential in this regard. Â   Â  Â  Foreign Reserves â€“ and Debt Loads In 2005, emerging marketsâ€™ foreign reserves began to surpass that of developed markets generally, and the spread has been widening. Debt levels are also more favorable for emerging markets, in our view. Overall, the ratio of public debt to GDP in emerging markets has been declining, while in developed markets â€”Â  we all know whatâ€™s happening in Europe and the U.S. â€”Â  it has been going up. Thatâ€™s not to say emerging markets donâ€™t face some fundamental concerns. Inflation has plagued emerging markets historically, and food and energy price increases can have a dramatically negative impact on peopleâ€™s standard of living.Â  In the early 1990s, inflation was accelerating rapidly in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. For example, Brazilâ€™s inflation rate (as measured by the consumer price index) in the 1980s and â€˜90s saw year-over-year percentage increases in the hundreds and even thousands. In the past couple of years, however, inflation has been cooling off in Brazil and some other emerging market economies. Consequently, interest rates have been coming down too as policymakers have more room to engage in stimulative economic measures. In the case of Brazil, the inflation rate has been running in the range of 5 â€“ 7% over the past two years. Â    Â  Investor Expectations â€“ By Region and Country Interestingly, by region, the GISS results reflected particularly strong optimism â€”and return expectations â€”in Latin America. On average, investors residing there had the highest expectations for their local stock market this year; 75% believed it will be up. I find that particularly interesting when juxtaposed against the negative attention thatâ€™s often given to the region, focused on poverty, crime and so forth. Apparently, there is more than one side to the story there. On a specific country level, investors in India were the most optimistic (85%) about their stock market among all 19 countries surveyed, and expected an average rate of return on their investments of 15% this year. According to the GISS, Indian investors certainly have high expectations! While we donâ€™t know exactly why these investors felt more upbeat, I can say my team and I remain optimistic about the countryâ€™s long-term prospects and believe after a trying 2012, new policy initiatives undertaken by the leaders hold potential. One last finding from the survey that struck me as interesting:Â  Emerging markets in general boast youthful populations, which to us, is more favorable for long-term growth prospects than populations which are rapidly aging. The GISS revealed younger investors (aged 25 â€“ 34) were more likely to expect to allocate assets to foreign markets (that is, outside their home country) both in 2013 (average of 40% vs. 30% for investors 35+) and over the next 10 years (average of 43% vs. 33% for investors 35+). Investors in all age groups expected they will be allocating a larger proportion of their investments to developed and emerging markets over the next 10 years, although the bulk of their investments still would remain in-country. I think the global-minded young investors have the right idea! Want to see the rest of what our survey respondents had to say? 2013 Franklin Templeton Global Investor Sentiment Survey. 1.

BloombergJoachim FelsCentral banks around the world continue to embrace easy monetary policy in its efforts to stimulate their local economies. Morgan Stanley's economics team has dubbed the moves since February as "the Great Monetary Easing, Part Three," or GME3. "I am surprised by the breadth of the move that we have seen recently," said Joachim Fels, Morgan Stanley's Global Head of Economics.Â  "In the last ten trading days we've seen the Fed tweak its language and we've had rate cuts from the ECB, Poland, India, Korea and Australia. So the breadth of the move has been surprising." "Now, what explains the moves? I think there are three global factors: 1) Japan had a big monetary easing announced in early April, so Japan is exporting deflation via its exchange rate. And I think other central banks wanted to buy insurance against that. 2) The global soft patch has been unfolding for the last month or two. 3) I think we're seeing globally synchronized disinflation largely caused by lower commodity prices. So I think these reasons explain why central banks have now behaved as one." Morgan Stanley's David Adelman sums up six points to keep in mind considering the backdrop of GME3.
