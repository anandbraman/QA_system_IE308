APASXTOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar gained against a basket of currencies and Asian shares gave up early gains, dragged lower by China shares after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signaled a shift towards monetary tightening ahead of a key Communist Party policy meeting. The safe-haven bid pushed up the yen, while the euro continued to languish on rising expectations that the European Central Bank will cut rates further, with a few strategists and investors saying action could come as early as its policy meeting on Thursday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan &lt;.MIAPJ0000PUS&gt; slipped about 0.2 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock average &lt;.N225&gt; edged down. Australian shares &lt;.AXJO&gt; rose 0.8 percent, moving back toward a five-year high hit last month after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its cash rate steady at a record low of 2.5 percent as widely expected. But the Shanghai Composite Index &lt;.SSEC&gt; slid 0.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index &lt;.HSI&gt; shed 0.7 percent, after Premier Li said in speech published in full late on Monday that China needs 7.2 percent economic growth to generate 10 million jobs. Adding extra stimulus would be more difficult since printing new money would cause inflation, Li said in the speech, which was delivered on October 21. His published remarks came as China's leaders prepare to meet from November 9 to Nov 12 at key plenum that will discuss deepening reforms. "His comments are different from what people were expecting. He definitely sounds more hawkish now and this is a shift from what he said earlier this year about bottom-line growth," said Hong Hao, chief strategist, Bank of Communications International. U.S. S&amp;P E-mini futures fell 0.1 percent, after the S&amp;P 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; closed up 0.4 percent on Monday, just shy of a record high, as a spate of comments from Federal Reserve officials offered investors no reason to believe a rollback of the U.S. stimulus program was imminent. ECB, U.S. PAYROLLS REPORT AWAITED The dollar index &lt;.DXY&gt;, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.1 percent to 80.625, holding well above a nine-month low of 78.998 hit on October 25. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was fell 0.2 percent to 98.42 yen. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3501, holding above Monday's low of $1.3441, which was its lowest since September 18, but remaining well below a nearly two-year high of $1.3832 set on October 25, as investors began to price in the likelihood of ECB easing action. Money markets were already pricing in the possibility of looser ECB policy in the coming year and began to show a chance of a cut in the next few months, and a few big banks expect a cut as early as this week. A rate cut would hurt the euro's yield advantage over other currencies and make it less appealing for investors. "We expect the ECB to leave its interest rates and forward guidance unchanged at Thursday's meeting," strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. "However, the latest decline in inflation has raised the likelihood that the main refinancing rate could be cut again by 25 basis points in December," they added. The ECB last lowered its refinancing rate in May, to a record low of 0.5 percent. In addition to the ECB, investors will continue to focus on U.S. data for clues on the timing of when the U.S. central bank will begin to taper its monthly purchases of $85 billion in assets. On Friday, the closely-watched October non-farm payrolls data will be released. Fed policymakers want to see the unemployment rate dropping closer to 6.5 percent from the current 7.2 percent, but economists in a Reuters survey expect the rate to have edged up in October to 7.3 percent. Ahead of the jobs report, third-quarter gross domestic product data will be published on Thursday. Those figures will help show how strong the momentum in the economy was before last month's partial government shutdown. Data on Monday showed orders for a wide range of U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in September, suggesting companies cut their investment plans. But other recent data indicated that factory activity accelerated in October. Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, said late on Monday that it may be appropriate to reduce the quantitative easing program when there is "compelling evidence of a sustainable recovery making satisfactory progress toward full employment. Earlier on Monday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the central bank need not rush because inflation remains low, while Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell said the tapering timing "is necessarily uncertain, as it depends on the evolution of the economy. In commodities trading, spot gold edged up to $1,315.85 an ounce. Copper added 0.5 percent to $7,181.50 a tonne from the previous session, when it fell 1.4 percent. U.S. crude also edged up slightly to $94.72, but stuck close to four-month lows touched on Monday on worries about growth in demand after a survey showed U.S. oil inventories were rising.

Flickr User Clementine Gallot (www.flickr.comAcademic research in the past has shown that the children of families on welfare are more likely to grow up to be on welfare themselves. But it isn't just poverty and poor health that are causing this.¬† A new NBER study by Gordon Dahl of UCSD, Andreas Kostol of the University of Bergen, and Magne Mogstad finds that a parent on welfare creates a culture within the family that makes their adult children more likely to accept welfare.¬† The study looks at data from Norway's "disability insurance" (DI) system and finds that when a parent is allowed DI, their adult child's likelihood of participation over the next five years increases by 6%, and grows to 12% after ten years.¬† According to the paper, this likely happens because "parents on welfare can provide information about the program to their children, reduce the stigma of participation, or invest differentially in child development." It finds that parents being on welfare is a cause for the child being on welfare, not just a correlated factor.¬† As a contrast, they find that children of parents who have been denied welfare have only a 1% probability of being on welfare as adults.  The researcher also found that when parents are on welfare, the probability of the child working or getting a college degree falls. Specifically, when a parent is on welfare, the child is 7.7% less likely to be employed full-time, and 8% less likely to get a college degree. Overall, they are 13% less likely to be employed at all.¬†¬† Read the whole paper at NBER.org.

The price of oil slipped closer to $94 a barrel Monday after falling more than 7 percent in the past month on ample supplies and muted demand. By early afternoon in Europe, benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 31 cents to $94.30 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dropped $1.77 to a four-month low of $94.61 on Friday. "Oil prices are finding themselves hardly able at all to recoup any of the losses they suffered last week," Frankfurt-based analysts at Commerzbank said in a note to clients. "This must be interpreted as a negative sign and points to further losses in the coming days ‚Äî probably triggered by financial investors who are withdrawing from the oil market." Ample supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks. The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. Over five weeks, supplies rose by more than 25 million barrels. U.S. refineries are undergoing fall maintenance, which has crimped demand for crude. "We are now at the nadir of the fall refinery maintenance season. Within the next couple of weeks demand will return to the market. To this effect, the return of refinery demand could help support values at current levels," Schork Report analysts said in an energy markets commentary. December's possible reduction or "tapering" of the financial stimulus provided to the economy through bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve also weighed on oil prices. Commodities like oil, as well as many stocks, have benefited from the Fed's stimulus program, attracting investors looking for higher returns than the low interest rates offered by bonds. Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, was down 50 cents at $105.41 on the ICE futures exchange in London. In other energy futures trading on Nymex: ‚Äî Wholesale gasoline lost 2.04 cents to $2.525 a gallon. ‚Äî Heating oil dropped 1.62 cents to $2.866 a gallon. ‚Äî Natural gas shed 9.9 cents to $3.414 per 1,000 cubic feet.

REUTERS/Mike BlakeGiant Panda mother Bai Yun snacks on bamboo as her cub Xiao Liwi is shown for the first time on public display at the San Diego Zoo in San Diego, California, January 10, 2013.If you want to know where relations stand between China and another country, follow the pandas. China, the only native of home of pandas in the world, has been giving pandas to nations based on beneficial trade agreements and their willingness to depart with crucial natural resources, according to a new study done by Oxford University. This represents a new phase of a longstanding practice, according to the researchers: Phase 1 during the Mao era (in the 1960s and 1970s) took the form of China gifting pandas to build strategic friendships. Phase 2 followed Deng Xiaoping's rise to power in 1978 when gifts became gift loans involving a capitalist lease model based on financial transactions. In the emerging phase 3, panda loans are associated with nations supplying China with valuable resources and technology and symbolize China's willingness to build†guanxiónamely, deep trade relationships characterized by trust, reciprocity, loyalty, and longevity.† The study reports that, after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake destroyed 23% of Chinaís panda habitats, there was a renewed need to loan out pandas to help pay for conservation efforts. In addition, significant damage to the Wolong Nature Reserve and Breeding Center meant there were sixty pandas that needed to be rehoused. Chinese authorities saw the rehousing need as an opportunity to raise conservation funds while building relationships with nations that China wants in their ìinner circle.î China loaned pandas to Canada and France after those countries signed multibillion dollar deals to export large quantities of uranium to China over the next decade. Pandas were sent to Japan and Australia after other major trade agreements. Likewise, in 2011, Chinaís deputy premier negotiated two concurrent deals with Scotland. The first was for a $4 billion contract to supply China with salmon meat, Land Rover cars, and petrochemical and renewable energy technology. The second was to bring two giant pandas to †the Edinburgh Zoo.† Dr. Kathleen Buckingham, the lead author on the study, was blunt about China's strategy. "Why has Edinburgh Zoo got pandas when London Zoo hasn't? Probably because Scotland has natural resources that China wants a stake in,î said Buckingham. ìRecipient countries need to assess the broader environmental consequences of 'sealing the deal' with China before accepting panda loans, as these usually signal that China expects a long-term commitment to deliver the goods ó whether they be uranium, salmon, or other natural resources.î The trend isnít isolated to resource deals either. In the following chart, you can see the correlation between Chinaís recent free trade agreements and countries theyíve loaned pandas to:†Oxford University And what China gives, it can also take away. In 2010, Two days after the U.S. decided to go forward with a meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama, against the wishes of the Chinese government,† China forced the return of two U.S.-born panda cubs. Earlier this year, the Chinese government†played the panda card with Austria, threatening not†to sign a new panda lease deal if the Austrian government didn't cancel a scheduled meeting with the Dalai Lama.†
AP Photo/Charles DharapakPresident Obama nominates Janet Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve.Since mid-September, when former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his name from consideration to replace Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve next year, market participants have become increasingly interested in the policy views of current Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen, who is now set to take the reins at the central bank when Bernanke's term expires in January. One item in particular has become the center of attention for those trying to figure out how a Yellen Fed will be different: the "optimal control" approach to monetary policymaking, as outlined by Yellen in a series of speeches last year. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, sums up the idea succinctly in a recent report: "This approach starts with a forecast for the economy, and then solves a large-scale macroeconomic model to find the path of the funds rate that minimizes the deviation of inflation and unemployment from their respective targets." The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) targets an annual inflation rate of 2% over the long run and an unemployment rate of 6% (the latter number an estimate of the economy's "natural" unemployment rate). Under the optimal control approach, the central bank would then use a model to calculate the optimal path of short-term interest rates in order to hit these targets. As long as unemployment is further away from the target level than inflation, then monetary policymakers would keep interest rates low in an attempt to correct this, even if it means inflation runs slightly above target for a while. Yellen illustrated the concept in a November 2012 speech. Here's the paragraph explaining how it would work, with relevant charts shown below: To derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the Committeeís enunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, I assume that monetary policy aims to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives. In computing the best, or "optimal policy," path for the federal funds rate to achieve these objectives, I will assume that the public fully anticipates that the FOMC will follow this optimal plan and is able to assess its effect on the economy. The blue lines with triangles labeled ìOptimal policyî show the resulting paths. The optimal policy to implement this ìbalanced approachî to minimizing deviations from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018. This highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the Committeeís 2 percent objective for several years. Federal Reserve The upshot of a Yellen Fed employing an optimal control strategy is simply the notion that the central bank would take a more aggressive stance toward fighting above-target unemployment, implying lower short-term rates for longer. Many believe such a policy shift could become the hallmark of her tenure at the helm of the central bank. "These paths serve as crucial internal benchmarks to [Yellen's] thinking," says Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs economists also cite optimal control as one of the reasons they doesn't foresee rate hikes until 2016. Yet, as Wall Street economists also acknowledge, just because Yellen seems to be a fan of optimal control, that doesn't necessarily mean it becomes the de facto approach. "While optimal control exercises can be informative, such analyses hinge on the selection of a specific macroeconomic model as well as a set of simplifying assumptions that may be quite unrealistic," said Yellen herself in an April 2012 speech.†"I therefore consider it imprudent to place too much weight†on the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods, so I simultaneously consider other approaches for gauging the appropriate stance of monetary policy." JPMorganJPMorgan's Feroli argues that the FOMC already employs the optimal control approach to some extent in a note to clients: Optimal†control†policies are not, per se, a Yellen innovation. At each FOMC meeting the Fed staff prepare the "Bluebook," which presents various policy alternatives. Since at least 2005 -- and intermittently even earlier going back to the 1990s -- the Bluebook has presented the†optimal†policy path of the funds rate. An example of such a Bluebook†optimal†policy exhibit is in the chart pasted below, which is from the latest publicly available Bluebook, from the December 2007 FOMC meeting. Technical documentation can be found†here. This†optimal†policy prepared by the staff uses the same loss function that Yellen used in her speeches: the squared errors of the inflation and unemployment rate from their targets, as well as the square of the quarterly change in the funds rate. The important point is that it would be incorrect to think of this as the "Yellen optimal control policy,"†but rather a long-standing product of the Fed's forecasting staff. And even if Yellen tries to move FOMC policymaking further in this direction, SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale chief U.S. economist Aneta Markowska argues she would likely have trouble doing so. "Yellen would probably face strong resistance from other FOMC members and would have a hard time building consensus around such a radical view," writes Markowska in a note. "Given the Fedís projections that the economy will be operating near full capacity by late 2016, guiding toward zero rates at that time would be incredibly risky: it could cause excessive risk taking or even worse, dislocate long-term inflation expectations, ultimately forcing a more aggressive tightening scenario. Given this dynamic, we suspect that forward guidance has been stretched to a limit and any further attempts to push down on the short-end of the curve could simply cause dislocations at the long-end." Furthermore, the optimal control approach doesn't really account for the risk of asset bubbles caused by overly-stimulative Fed policy, something to which Steven Englander, global head of G-10 FX strategy at Citi, believes much of the FOMC is still highly attentive. "A number of clients have expressed concern about financial markets under a policy path that stays so aggressive for so long," he writes in a recent note. "Even if everything is correctly specified in the model, the risk is that investors take this policy as a 'westward-ho' for risk taking. Fed funds at zero for many years could stimulate another round of bidding up asset prices and another set of bubble related issues." "The suspicion is that in the event, the Fed will pursue more cautious policy to avert another bubble," Englander continues. "Bottom line is that investors believe that financial stability is somewhere in the Fed's true objective function even if does not seem to play a big role in their optimal control simulations. It actually should be read as a compliment to the Fed."†
NASAIndia likes its stuff cheap. Maker of the world's cheapest car¬†($2600), world's cheapest tablet¬†($60)¬†and even the world's cheapest house ($700), India is now launching the world's cheapest mission to Mars, which takes off this week. The mission, launched by Indian space agency ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) will cost the Indian government just $80 million, which compares to NASA's $2.5 billion expenditure on the US' Mars Curiosity project.¬† The satellite is called Mangalyaan (Mars Vehicle), and will not touch down on the planet. It has been only been designed for orbit. 21 of the 51 global missions to Mars gave failed, including the one launched by China.¬† But how has India managed to keep its costs so low? The answer, according to the Economic Times,¬†¬†is "frugal engineering," which has a few basic principles: to adapt existing technology as far as possible, minimize the number of physical models and optimize testing. Unlike its European and US counterparts, ISRO has a much smaller budget and cannot afford to experiment and build iteratively. While NASA and the European Space Agency usually make three models of the spacecraft, ISRO modeled everything on software and physically built only the final model.¬† This frugal approach does increase risks, which are evident from India's previous failed space missions.¬†Also, instead of flying directly, the 350-tonne rocket will orbit earth for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from the earth's gravitational pull.¬† India's space mission has been criticized as being a waste of resources in a country where a huge proportion of the population still lives in poverty. However, defendants of the program have stated that the space program goes hand-in-hand with India's development goals. The Washington Post reports Dean Cheng a scholar at the Heritage Foundation saying, "The country realized early on that satellites would enable health officials to practice medicine remotely, reaching inaccessible parts of the country. The same was true for remote education. ISRO's major focus, in other words, has been to use space research as a way to overcome the country's (still) steep economic obstacles." The chairman of ISRO, K. Radhakrishnan, has defended the program saying that India's budget for space exploration is only 0.34% of its annual budget, of which 7% has been allocated to planetary exploration.¬†He also believes that the mission will also have positive implications for the rest of the economy, and will help with cyclone forecasting.¬† REUTERS GRAPHICS
Israeli startup Wix has been talking up IPO plans for what seems like forever and on Wednesday the company will finally go public. It filed its paperwork with the SEC in May using the confidential provision enabled by the JOBS Act. Last week, it revealed it will sell†7.7 million shares (29% from existing shareholders) priced between $14.50 and $16.50 with plans to raise $119 million for the company. At the mid-point price, the company will be valued at $719 million. On Monday, Wix set the date for the IPO: Wednesday. Wix, founded in 2006, generated $44 million in revenue in 2012, and lost $12 million. For the first nine months of September, it generated $56 million and lost $18 million. The company, based in Tel Aviv, hosts build-your-own websites. It's available in multiple languages in 190 countries and is growing at a rate of 34,000 new registered users per day, it says.  The websites can be designed for mobile devices, too.  Wix is one of a string of Israeli tech companies with a profitable exit in 2013. But most of the others were acquired. For instance, in 2013, Google bought Waze for about $1 billion. Cisco paid $475 million for wireless company Intucell. EMC bought storage startup ScaleIO for about $300 million.† This will be the one of the biggest Israeli U.S. IPOs since 2010, Forbe's Katie Roof reports.  Israel is known as "startup nation" and U.S. investors have been pouring venture investment funds into the country for the past few years, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt's fund, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft's VC fund, Battery Ventures, Benchmark, Bessemer and Sequoia. For that reason, all eyes†in Israel and the U.S. are on Wix's IPO. If it goes well, there will likely be a rush of other hot Israeli companies going public, too. Our favorite thing about Wix is its gorgeous offices overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

South Korea Is One Of The Few Solid Rocks Amidst Sea Of Leaky Emerging Market Barges (A. Gary Shilling Insights)  Even though Gary Shilling is short emerging market stocks and bonds, he thinks South Korea might be an exception. "South Korea has emerged as one of the few relatively solid rocks amidst a sea of leaky emerging market barges," writes Shilling in the latest A. Gary Shilling's Insights. Investors have been rushing to South Korean equities. "Investors of late have been rushing into South Korean equities amidst the Fed's recent discussion of tapering its $85 billion per month in security purchases, as we'll discuss later. As of the end of October, the KOSPI index was down only 1% from the October 2007 peak. In contrast, the MSCI World index is off 4% since then and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index has dropped 14%." Shilling points out that South Korean bonds are also attractive to foresight investors because of the "relative stability of the country, higher yield and rising currency."¬†  How You Should Invest Until The Year-End (Track Research) This is a year for equities in both Europe and the U.S. writes Robert Savage in Track Research. "Global shares saw $2.3 trillion added in market capitalization in October. The US S&amp;P500 rose 4.6% - the best performance since July. Bond rose 0.9% or yields for 10Y fell 12bps to 2.60% - the best performance since April - but remain off 0.5% for the year.¬†¬† "...Trading continued to hold a ‚Äúgoldilocks‚Äù theme where economic growth was not strong enough to push the FOMC to stop QE bond buying but was sufficient to drive corporate profits. Earnings beat most estimates and Europe saw the biggest gains with 15 weeks of gains for Italy and Greece." Economic forces still suggest a global recovery and support stocks over bonds. But "the role of the markets in forecasting growth into 2014 matters and the asset allocation questions revolve around getting GDP globally to match against the right investments."

Citi's Panic/Euphoria model has a pretty extraordinary track record for predicting returns. It's a contrarian indicator, which means a "euphoria" signal is bearish and a "panic" signal is bullish.† According to Citi, the model's components include "NYSE short interest ratio, margin debt, Nasdaq daily volume as % of NYSE volume, a composite average of Investors Intelligence and the American Association of Individual Investors bullishness data, retail money funds, the put/call ratio, CRB futures index, gasoline prices and the ratio of price premiums in puts versus calls." And currently, the model dangerously close to euphoria territory, reaching its highest level since 2008. "The Panic/Euphoria Model is sending a clear warning sign of substantial complacency," said Citi's Tobias Levkovich in a note to clients today. "The investment communityís mindset is widely monitored and investors anecdotally have become more bullish in conversations and meetings looking to an expected traditional late-year seasonal rally, despite a better than 20% move year-to-date."

Out.of.FocusA man deflates a hot-air balloon.The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program of bond buying has, in its various iterations since it began in 2009, caused fears about runaway inflation as the Fed's balance sheet has ballooned and base money has expanded. "QE is by design set to be inflationary," says Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale. "Yet we were asked several times last week whether the opposite could hold true; i.e. that QE is in fact proving deflationary." In a note to clients, Marcussen writes: In theory, a permanent increase in money supply results in a proportional increase in all money prices. Central bank asset purchases boost money supply, but this ìinflationaryî impact of QE is only temporary as the assets are in the future set to either be sold to private investors or redeemed to central banks, thus exerting a "deflationary" impact. For QE to be efficient, this argument would thus suggest that central banks (Fed, BoE, BoJ ... and even the ECB!) should simply forgive their considerable holdings of debt (mainly government debt) thus making the increase in base money permanent. In the case of the US, cancelling the $2tn of Treasuries held by the Fed would also offer a quick fix to the debt ceiling issue. This somewhat tongue-in-cheek argument merits qualification. Indeed, there is base money and then there is broader money aggregates. While QE has boosted the former, the impact on the later has been modest to date due to still lacklustre credit channels. This ties in with our long-held view that the key to sustainable recovery lies with corporates regaining sufficient confidence to borrow, to invest and to hire (and not to swap equity for debt via share buybacks). Moreover, tempting as a cancellation (or a restructuring to perpetual zero coupon bonds) of government bonds held by central banks may sound; we are concerned that such a policy could ultimately prove inflationary in a bad way (think Weimar Republic). Indeed, this goes to the very heart of the argument as to why QE is not printing money. Marcussen also points to the effect the Fed's quantitative easing program has had on the Chinese economy. QE spurred capital inflows, causing a credit boom which many fear is now coming undone. "The result is that China suffers significant excess capacity and poor capital returns, not to mention a shaky shadow banking system that China Economist Wei Yao has written extensively about," says Marcussen. "Excess capacity is deflationary and the means to deal with it is to shut it down. Indeed, we expect China for now to exert deflationary pressure on the global economy." The bottom line, according to Marcussen: "Unproductive investment is by nature ultimately deflationary. This is a point also worth recalling when investing in paper assets fuelled by QE liquidity and not underpinned by sustainable economic growth."
REUTERS/Steve Marcus This morning the Justice Department announced that it had come to an agreement with hedge fund SAC Capital. The fund had been charged with insider trading, and in order to settle those charges, it admitted guilt, agreed to pay a $1.8 billion fine, and return all money belonging to outside investors. In short, the storied hedge fund would shut down, leaving CEO Steve Cohen ‚Äî known for being one of the most successful traders on Wall Street ‚Äî with a $9 billion family office... and an ongoing SEC investigation into his own trading. Cohen began his Stamford-headquartered hedge fund in 1992 with only $25 million, and came into prominence for his grand slam returns. In its better days, SAC had $14 billion assets under management and employees around 900 people globally.¬† Then things turned very sour, as accusations of insider trading started to plague the firm and its subsidiary hedge funds. Most notably, last year Cohen was fingered in several media reports as "Portfolio Manager A" in the insider trading case against former CR Intrinsic (a subsidiary of SAC) portfolio manager Mathew Martoma. ¬† Since then, Federal authorities haven't given an inch, and in a press conference about SAC's settlement today, U.S. Attorney Preet Bahrara hinted that prosecutors and regulators were far from done with Cohen and his firm. "No institutions should rest easy in the belief that it is too big to jail," said Bharara. "Today one of the world's most powerful hedge funds... agreed to shut down... That is the just... outcome." Here's how it all fell down.
REUTERS/ Ueslei MarcelinoA new report from Wells Fargo's Jay Bryson and Mackenzie Miller takes a look at developing economies and their potential exposure to a financial crisis. Bryson and Miller rank the¬†28 largest developing economies based on economic indicators that are associated with financial crises: "Foreign exchange (FX) reserves, the real exchange rate, growth in credit, GDP growth, and the current account. That is, countries that have low FX reserves, an appreciated exchange rate, rapid credit and GDP growth, and current account deficits tend to have the highest probabilities for financial crises." Bryson and Miller stress that crises are not necessarily inevitable for these countries, but "developments in these economies bear watching in coming years."

A group at The University Of Wisconsin has compiled Census migration data from the 1950s to the 2000s into a bunch of highly informative maps. Two maps stuck out to us showing that, compared with the 1950s, Americans at their prime earnings age have stopped moving around.¬† That's probably a bad sign for the economy, because it means no single area of the country is demonstrating clear labor demand, so there's no release valve if things start to go bad in your area.¬† As is mostly well known, people have in recent years been abandoning the Rust Belt and Plains States, mostly, but not overwhelmingly to the benefit of the coasts and urban areas in the South.

Bloomberg TV screenshotAre men better networkers than women? A Linkedin study from 2011 found that men are more savvy than women at networking online. Anne Fulenwider, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire magazine, recently had this conversation with†Amy J.C. Cuddy, assistant professor at Harvard Business School and†famed TED speaker. "Amy said that women are known to be sociable and men are known to be not [as sociable], so when men go out of their way, they're given bonus points,"†Fulenwider†told Business Insider. In short, when women network aggressively, they're believed to be doing it solely to gain career trajectory, said Fulenwider, but when men go out of their way, it is perceived to be genuine. This was seen in a case study conducted by Columbia Business School more than a decade ago when researchers asked students what they thought of venture capitalist and legendary networker Heidi Roizen. The researchers found that students deemed her†"more selfish and less desirable" than the†fictional subject Howard Roizen, who had the exact same credentials and contacts as Heidi. Basically, Heidi was given a lower likeability†rating than Howard for no other reason than being a woman. Does society view career-minded women too harshly, or are men just better at charming the crowd? And if it's the latter, what are women doing wrong? According to Wall Street powerhouse Sallie Krawcheck, it all comes down to casting a wider net and thinking broadly, instead of deeply. This means networking and connecting with as many people as possible ó especially those outside of your industry. You need to put yourself out there, said†Krawcheck, but you don't have to become good friends with everyone you meet. And this is where women, in particular, run into trouble. "Women tend to fall into the 'best friend syndrome.' We invest deeply in our friendships and conflate casual relationships with shallow ones,"†Krawcheck wrote†in Marie Claire's November issue. This is unnecessary and impractical. You can't spend time grabbing coffee with every person you meet. "Loose connections are the connections you need. It's the No. 1 rule of business,"†Krawcheck said last week at Marie Claire's luncheon for the "New Guard," a group of women who are deemed masters at turning contacts into opportunities. Krawcheck told the audience how a loose connection she met nine years ago led her to buy 85 Broads, a global women's network, this year.  Someone you see twice a year may know of opportunities you don't, said Krawcheck, and if you've made a good impression and put yourself out there, they'll likely think of you. But how do you ensure that you're making a good impression or that people will think of you when opportunities arise? "It's all about being present in the moment, having a genuine interest in this person, and understanding why theyíre interested in the field that they are in," said†Fulenwider.†"You don't have to make this person your best friend, it doesn't have to be the most meaningful connection," but it does need to be a genuine one, she said.
Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management gained 7.9 percent net of fees for the month of October in its largest fund, dramatically reversing the year-to-date returns of the outspoken activist investor. Pershing Square International is now up 8.1 percent for the year, according to an investor performance update obtained by CNBC.com. The same fund had been up just 0.2 percent through September.

Stock prices are going up as earnings growth expectations are going down.†  "During the month of October, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&amp;P 500 for the fourth quarter," said FactSet's John Butters. "The Q4 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the estimates for all 500 companies in the index) dropped 1.5% (to $28.46 from $28.90) during the month." "At the same time, the value of the S&amp;P 500 increased 4.5% (to 1756.54 from 1681.55) during October, and it closed at a record high on October 29 (1771.95)," added Butters. There's arguably nothing more important to long-term stock market returns than earnings (or profit) growth. "Profits are the mother's milk of stocks," says Larry Kudlow. This phenomenon of prices rising faster than earnings is referred to as multiples expansion.† In other words, valuations are rising as reflected by an increasing price-earnings ratio. However, price-earnings ratios are drifting farther and farther away from their long-term averages, causing some market watchers to warn that we are in a bubble. Surely, stock market bears warning of a sell-off can't help but rip their hair out when they see charts like this.  FactSet
REUTERS/ Lucas JacksonU.S. District Attorney Preet Bharara spoke publicly about the $1.8 billion fine and admission of guilt hedge fund SAC Capital agreed to this morning ó the settlement is still subject to Court approval. Columbia law professor John Coffee told Fox Business Network that Cohen had to make this deal, or take the risk of having an even more expensive Court case drag SAC Capital through even more reputational mud. The fund will also return all outside capital and become a family office. At the government's press conference, an FBI official said that SAC created an unprecedented "culture of corporate corruption." Now ó a few details about the settlement. U.S. Attorney† Preet Bharara said that no individuals have been indicted, and that those who have already been indicted (like former SAC employee Mathew Martoma, whose trial begins next year) will still be presumed innocent despite the firm's admission of guilt. On the other hand, individuals that have yet to be accused of insider trading aren't safe yet. For example, the SEC is continuing its probe into Steven Cohen as an individual, and that means the SEC could still bar him from the securities industry for failing to supervise his brokers. Until then, he could technically just start another hedge fund ó not exactly what the SEC is going for. "No institutions should rest easy in the belief that it is too big to jail," said Bharara. "Today one of the world's most powerful hedge funds... agreed to shut down... That is the just... outcome." A few more important points about the settlement: The SEC will create a timetable for unwinding the hedge fund. No outside investor money will be used to pay the hedge fund's $1.8 billion fine (which Bharara called "fair but steep), and there will be no deduction or tax benefit available for funds used to pay this settlement (which, for the record, will go to the U.S. Treasury).
REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlinRobert Shiller, one of three American scientists who won the 2013 economics Nobel prize, attends a press conference in New Haven, Connecticut, October 14, 2013.Private equity giant Blackstone has been a massive force in the U.S. housing market, buying up thousands of foreclosed homes and converting them in to rental properties. Yesterday, the FT's¬†Tracy Alloway and Anjili Raval reported that Blackstone will launch a "novel security" this week that will pay investors with the rental income coming from these properties. This caught the attention of newly-minted Nobel Prize winner and housing markets guru Robert Shiller, who Tweeted that this could "mark a revolution." We reached out to Shiller for more color. "I am excited to hear about this new possibility," he responded. Shiller told us he believes this would provide the market with more current and accurate pricing information, thus making the housing market much more efficient. "My first thought is that this securitization might develop the markets further, and that the two markets might support each other," he added. "On a deeper level, regardless of its impact on the futures market, if the REO to rental securities take hold, and become liquid, it may increase the efficiency of the market for single family homes," he added. "That market has been extraordinarily inefficient, as [Karl] Case and I showed in an American Economic Review article 25 years ago. Momentum persists for years. That would all change if professionals could really play a liquid market, and did so on a large scale." Housing market derivatives are not news to Shiller. In 2006, Shiller and Case collaborated with S&amp;P and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to launch a futures contract on single-family homes. "That contract is still going today, though weakly, see¬†homepricefutures.com, a site maintained by John Dolan," he told us. Indeed, these contracts sound like a good idea in theory, but in practice they haven't been very successful. "[T]here may be difficulties actually finding a market for these securities, as there was for the securitization of shared appreciation mortgages (SAM) in the 1990s," said Shiller. Those SAM mortgages occurred when a lender agreed to receive a lower interest rate in exchange for a percentage of the appreciation of the house at the time of sale. They failed to catch on because, when they were first proposed in the U.S. in the late 90's, no one was worried about price declines, according to Harvard Business School's Robin Greenwood and Luis Viceira. Reuters' Adam Tempkin reported last week that prospective investors pitched by Blackstone were fairly receptive to the new security, although they apparently had some concern about whether Blackstone had enough "skin in the game," as well as overly optimistic¬†"broker price opinions," or BPOs, of current home values. Given that Shiller has recently said he's starting to see signs of another bubble, it may be in everyone's interest to increase efficiency as soon as possible.
Screenshot via SMCPOn October 16, Jimmy Kimmel, host of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," held a "kids table" segment on the government shutdown. "America owes China a lot of money, $1.3 trillion. How should we pay them back" Kimmel asked. One child immediately suggested "killing everyone in China."† At the time, there wasn't much controversy about the joke. Then, China noticed and all hell broke loose. Petitions to have the show investigated were signed by almost 100,000 people, and protesters stood outside Kimmel's studio holding signs that compared him to Hitler. Now, a new video that patiently explains†why America shouldn't kill everyone in China has gone viral on the Chinese Internet, with almost 50,000 views on Youku in one day. According to Global Voices, the video was created by marketing company vmini.com and published by dig.chouti.com, a portal similar to reddit.com.  The video points out China's incredible resilient history ("we are undying Chinese, can't be killed by anyone"), how hard they work to make a living, how much the country makes for the U.S., how much China's bonds purchases have actually helped the U.S. economy, and the simple fact that it'd cost an incredible amount to kill every Chinese person, no doubt putting the U.S. into further debt. While the video appears to be in good humor, what might be worrying for Kimmel is that the story doesn't appear to be going away, even though†Kimmel and ABC have apologized, and the video itself was pulled by ABC when the controversy began. We'd imagine that in the future, TV producers may be a bit more careful when they mention China ó a country of 1.3 billion people that no one wants to upset. Here's the clip of the segment that caused all the controversy:

AP Sweden's Finance Minister, Anders Borg, is a big figure in the European financial world. His anti-Keynesian policies, which seem somewhat out of place in Sweden, have been credited with helping bolster his country's remarkable economic success in recent years. In 2011, the Financial Times gave him top position in every category when ranking Europe's finance ministers. Perhaps the most notable feature of the relatively conservative politician, however, has always been his ponytail and earring. Thus people were shocked when he showed up to a talk on the state of the economy¬†Monday with a shorn head.¬†Stunned reporters tweeted photos: ah man kan s√§ga att det √§r klippt f√∂r anders borg atm pic.twitter.com/hXC8LkAkiK FLASH!

BalthazarLast week, I suggested that stationing bathroom attendants in the bathrooms of restaurants like New York's Balthazar was not a service that many clients enjoyed or wanted. Importantly, I did not blame the bathroom attendants for this: Balthazar's bathroom attendants in particular did their jobs well. Instead, I blamed the "idiot bosses" at restaurants like Balthazar who were apparently hallucinating that their clients enjoyed this service. Well, over the weekend, Foster Kamer of First We Feast emailed the head of Balthazar, Keith McNally, to get his reaction to my feelings about the bathroom service. Surprisingly, Mr. McNally said he wholeheartedly agreed with me. And he used his response to Mr. Kamer to announce that Balthazar would no longer have bathroom attendants going forward. The wording of Mr. McNally's response does not make clear whether he is going to reassign the folks who worked as bathroom attendants at Balthazar ó or fire them. We have reached out to Balthazar for clarification. But in case there's any question... †Balthazar should absolutely not fire its bathroom attendants. It's not their fault that Mr. McNally made them stand in the bathroom all day. And Balthazar's decision to discontinue this service is his, not theirs. Also, importantly, as Mr. McNally says, these folks appear to be excellent people and loyal and talented employees: ìUnfortunately,†I completely agree with [the point about the bathroom service] and will, in the next few weeks, relieve the restaurantís bathroom attendants of their duties.†Theyíre extremely loyal employees who, perhaps surprisingly, love their jobs..." As the proprietor of a thriving business, Mr. McNally will presumably be the first to agree that "extremely loyal employees who... love their jobs" are a major asset to an organization. And given that standing in a bathroom all day and trying to be gracious, polite, and helpful in that environment is arguably a much more challenging job than, say, being a waiter or bus-person, it would seem that the Balthazar bathroom attendants would be ideally suited to be worked into the rotation in Balthazar's dining room. Yes, it's possible that Balthazar is not right this minute looking for more waiters or bus-people, but, if not, they will be soon. If Mr. McNally wants to show his gratitude to these employees, therefore ó and accept responsibility for his own decision to make them stand in bathrooms and provide services Balthazar diners didn't want ó he will immediately hire and train them as dining-room staff. So we await clarification from Balthazar about the fate of the good people Balthazar employs as bathroom attendants. Here's hoping Mr. McNally and Balthazar do the right thing.
(Photo by China Photos/Getty Images)China has been making moves to replace its trade in dollars with trade in the renminbi.  The Chinese trade in renminbi is going to be worth nearly 30% of their international trade by 2020, according to a research note by Standard Chartered's Becky Liu and her team. This is projected to be worth $3 trillion.  That's $3 trillion that could otherwise be denominated in dollars. And this has implications for the U.S. monetary system, which boasts the dollar as the global reserve currency.  Being the reserve currency has huge advantages. Since international trade is currently denominated in dollars, there is a constant, ensured demand for dollars. This is one of the reasons the Fed is able to issue large amounts of debt and carry out programs like quantitative easing ó buying government issued bonds to lower long-term rates when short-term rates are zero. † This demand for the dollar has also helped keep interest rates and inflation in the U.S. economy low, which makes it an attractive destination for international borrowers.† The push to replace the dollar trade has come, in part, as a result of volatility in the dollar. Political instability in the form of the debt limit and the potential for U.S. debt default, as well as the uncertainty coming from the Fed's taper talks has driven volatility in the greenback. In order to side-step this volatility, countries have been taking steps to make themselves less dependent on the dollar. Last month, Europe and China signed a Ä45 billion currency swap deal that allowed them to settle trades in local currencies in order to sidestep the dollar. India has also made an agreement with Iran to settle trades in rupees.† Currently, the trade in China's renminbi is extremely restricted. Its value trades within a narrow band of the dollar and converting money to and from renminbi isn't easy. This is because the Chinese government is worried about speculative attacks on the currency. "We expect Chinaís capital account to be basically open by 2020," writes Liu. "Direct investment will flow much more easily than today, with only large deals subject to approval requirements." "We think the Renminbi will be a basically freely floating currency, the capital account will be more or less open, and SHIBOR (or a similar rate) will operate as Chinaís equivalent of the federal funds target rate." As the onshore renminbi market expands (CNY),†the offshore Renminbi (CNH) debt market is expected to grow at 30% a year, and to be worth $500 billion by 2020.† One particularly blistering editorial in Xinhua, China's official news agency, reflects how the Chinese feel about the U.S. dollar: † "Most recently, the cyclical stagnation in Washington for a viable bipartisan solution over a federal budget and an approval for raising debt ceiling has again left many nations' tremendous dollar assets in jeopardy and the international community highly agonized. ...The developing and emerging market economies need to have more say in major international financial institutions including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, so that they could better reflect the transformations of the global economic and political landscape. What may also be included as a key part of an effective reform is the introduction of a new international reserve currency that is to be created to replace the dominant U.S. dollar, so that the international community could permanently stay away from the spillover of the intensifying domestic political turmoil in the United States." But China still has some way to go before it can become a truly international currency.
Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergTreasuries have been rallying since early September, sending yields lower.David Woo, global head of rates and currencies research at BofA Merrill Lynch, suggests the next "pain trade" is betting on Treasuries. On the other hand, Woo's counterpart at SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale, global head of rates and FX strategy†Vincent Chaigneau, says the next pain trade is betting against Treasuries. The "pain trade" refers to a crowded trade that goes in the wrong direction, causing more damage to more portfolios than any other trade ó so it can't really be both long Treasuries and short Treasuries at the same time. But both are using the phrase to support their respective calls on where the market is going next: BAML is currently advising clients to short Treasuries, and SocGen is advising just the opposite. "Our discussions with clients suggest that†many market players, perhaps too many, want to be short here," says Chaigneau. "That may be the pain trade just now, in an environment where inflation continues to surprise to the downside (U.S. CPI for September reported at just 1.2% yoy, with core up only 0.1% mom, EMU HICP at just 0.7% yoy in October) and growth remains soft." In other words, Chaigneau thinks Treasuries are going to continue to rally, catching the majority (which wants to be short, according to the SocGen strategist) flat-footed. Chaigneau says the team remains "cautiously bullish on U.S. Treasuries, with yields likely drifting down 10-20 [basis points] over coming weeks." Woo, on the other hand, argues that the "pain trade" is in the other direction ó investors long Treasuries will experience the most hurt ó supporting BAML's short-Treasuries call initiated October 25. "The September FOMC meeting and the October government shutdown precipitated a big shift in the consensus over the tapering timetable, leading to a major repricing of markets over the past six weeks," says Woo, referring to the rally in the Treasury market since September 18, when the Fed unexpectedly refrained from tapering down its quantitative easing program. "This seems to have finally run its course," he writes. "Where are we now? Where are we going next? What is the next pain trade?" BofA Merrill Lynch Global ResearchThe AUD/USD volatility curve suggests the market is pricing March as the most likely timetable for the tapering announcement.Woo is looking at forward exchange-rate volatility curves, which he says "allow us to gauge more precisely when the market expects tapering to start." "The fact that the forward curve of [1-month] AUD/USD volatility peaks four months from now (near the level of [1-month] volatility just before the September FOMC meeting) leaves little doubt that March is the marketís new central scenario for the start of tapering," says Woo. The BAML strategist believes that because of this new consensus in the market that tapering doesn't begin before March, investors are piling into carry trades ó which do well in environments of low interest-rate volatility and happen to be what SocGen has been recommending to clients lately. Woo says Friday's October nonfarm payrolls report "could put this consensus and carry trades to test." "If the market was too confident about September tapering six weeks ago, it may be too confident about March tapering now," he writes. "This is why we like running short rates, long USD and long volatility positions going into Friday."
REUTERS/ Jose Luis MagauaIn the week's issue of The New Yorker, Nicholas Lemann profiles Mary Jo White, with friends and colleagues describing the SEC chair "as the most competitive and driven person they have ever encountered." Lemann charts the career of the "plainspoken" White, who loves Fleetwood Mac, tennis, and requiring Wall Street bigwigs to acknowledge wrongdoing in SEC settlements. White has moved between Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, a major New York law firm, and the federal government. "Whiteís life is about working, and winning," Lemann writes. From the profile: White is plainspoken and doesnít seem slick or fancy. Every year, she holds a Super Bowl party. Her favorite band is Fleetwood Mac. Her favorite charity is the A.S.P.C.A. She has had the same cohort of intimate friends since the seventiesóthree or four women who worked together in the U.S. Attorneyís office and helped form a female basketball team there. When she returns to New York on weekends, they still try to have dinner, and they go on occasional trips together. She does not put her competitiveness aside when conducting her social life. She and her husband, John White, have a tennis court at their country house, in upstate New York, where her style of play led her friends to give her the nickname Sid Vicious. After she organized a team to run in an athletic event called the Great Race, and it finished second, she successfully petitioned the race officials to create a special certificate for her team to take home. She makes sure to win even at Boggle or crazy eights. Although she is a sports fan (baseball first, especially the Yankees, football second, horse racing third) and often invites people to join her at games, she doesnít carry on conversations while the ball is live. She doesnít read much for pleasure. She doesnít belong to a church. Her large apartment, on the Upper East Side, is said to look about as lived-in as a suite in an extended-stay motel. Whiteís life is about working, and winning. White has overseen an arguably "tougher" SEC, from rejecting a settlement with hedge funder Philip Falcone to personally implicating SAC's Steve Cohen in his firm's insider trading scandal to forcing JP Morgan to admit wrongdoing in the London Whale trading mishap. As an aside, Reuters' Felix Salmon points out a few factual error in the piece.

Morgan StanleyFalling pump prices are helping boost the U.S. economy to the tune of a 130 basis point jump in personal consumption expenditures.† As we always emphasize, that has less to do with the Great American Shale Boom, which mostly impacts West Texas Intermediate prices, than it does with the macroeconomic factors affecting the price of Brent, which is the more global oil benchmark. In a new note, Morgan Stanley's Adam Longson details just how dramatic the fall in Brent prices has been. He notes that forward prices are converging toward the lower spot price. The last time that happened around this time of year was 2010. Here's what Longson says is happening: ...A falling USD, Libya/Iraq headlines and bearish WTI-Brent positioning have helped support prices. If these support mechanisms begin to erode, as we expect, prices could fall to match the weak physical market. Expectations of an ECB rate cut have already reversed the weak USD trend. Higher seasonal demand and lower refinery maintenance offer some offset, but poor global refining margins will continue to limit runs.† And more overseas supply is coming online: stocks are "recovering" in Iraq as maintenance winds down, Longson says, with production climbing 300,000 barrels per day MOM in October to 3.1 million barrels/day. Lower seasonal demand in Saudi Arabia should also "free up more crude for export if production remains elevated," he writes. There's even more incremental supply coming out of the North Sea. Only Libyan production remains volatile. Longson expects Q4 Brent prices to remain around current levels, but a bear case could see spot prices fall to as low as $98.†
It was expected today and now here it is ‚Äî hedge fund SAC Capital has plead guilty to insider trading charges. The firm will pay $1.8 billion in fines ($1.2 billion was expected) and close its doors to outside investors. Here's U.S. Attorney Preet Bahrara's office in the Southern District of New York tweeted about it this morning: ¬† SAC mgmt companies agree to plead guilty to all counts in crim indict, pay $1.8 billion, &amp; terminate SAC Capital‚Äôs investment advisory bus That essentially means that CEO Steve Cohen's incredible run as one of Wall Street's most sought after money managers is finished. By the end of the year, $6 billion will be returned to outside investors ‚Äî pension funds, high net worth individuals etc. ‚Äî and SAC will be a family office with $8 billion AUM. The FBI, the Justice Department and the SEC have all been involved in investigating SAC in their own ways, and this admission of guilt doesn't end those investigations. The FBI is still going through Cohen's trades, and the SEC is still investigating him as an individual as well. The regulator seeks to ban him from the securities industry entirely. Until then, as Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle pointed out, the immediate, painful change at SAC stemming from these legal issues¬† will be the end of its ability to recruit and keep the best and brightest on Wall Street ‚Äî Cohen's "power posse."
With the economy still looking anemic, investors are wondering where growth will come from. Surprisingly, sales growth in the S&amp;P 500 has actually been accelerating. But don't be fooled. This is not all organic growth, i.e. growth from existing operations. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 are buying growth via mergers and acquisitions. "Earnings season has nearly ended and many stocks that drove S&amp;P 500 revenue growth in 3Q owe their strong top-line growth to acquisitions," wrote Goldman Sachs' David Kostin in a new note to clients. "Year/year revenue growth equaled just 1% in first-half 2013 but surged to 5% in 3Q," added Kostin. "Notably, just 20 companies accounted for 25% of aggregate sales but 50% of growth. 18 of the 20 firms completed acquisitions during the past year. The 20 stocks boosted 3Q sales by 13% versus just 2% for other firms." The good news is that corporations are using their cash for something. The bad news is that these deals distort the growth message being sent by the S&amp;P 500. Here's more from Kostin: The list of 20 stocks boosted revenues by 13% year/year in aggregate compared with just 2% for the other 369 non-Financial or Utility S&amp;P 500 firms. Examples include Aetna, which lifted sales by 46% from 3Q 2012 and noted on its earnings conference call that the increase came ìprimarily from the addition of Coventry.î Freeport-McMoRan reported 40% sales growth, noting that it benefitted from ìa significant contribution from a full quarter of results from the recently acquired oil and gas business.î The S&amp;P 500 effectively becomes the S&amp;P 501 or S&amp;P 502 with each respective acquisision. There's nothing evil or misleading about growing through acquisitions. In theory, companies will only make these deals if they think it'll benefit them. Often times, acquisitions generate cost-saving synergies. For example, call-centers and warehouses will be consolidated.† Unfortunately, this also means layoffs. All of this reminds us that the S&amp;P 500 and the economy are not the same thing.
Icahn Enterprises, the publicly traded investment firm through which Carl Icahn works his magic, reported its third quarter earnings this morning. And say what you will about Wall Street's most outspoken septuagenarian and his controversial activist investing strategy, but these numbers don't lie. Icahn enterprises reported revenues of $5.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and net income attributable to Icahn Enterprises of $472 million. That's up from $4.5 billion of revenues and a net income of $84 million for the same quarter in 2012. That's something worth writing about, so Icahn attached this little note to his earnings statement. His basic point ó if you'd bought Icahn stock in 2009, as the global economy was getting back on its feet, you would've scored an average annual return of 39%: ìI believe that by far the best method to utilize in investing is the ìActivistî model. I have spent a great deal of time and effort perfecting its use and I am happy to say that IEP has been a beneficiary of this. An investment in IEP stock made at the beginning of 2000 has increased by approximately 1,500%, or an average annual return of 22%, through October 31, 2013. But perhaps more compelling is that since April 1, 2009, when the economic recovery started: 1) an investment in IEP stock resulted in a total return of 347%, or an average annual return of 39%, through October 31, 2013, and 2) IEPís indicative net asset value has increased during this period by 282%, or an average annual return of 35%, through September 30, 2013. Most importantly to current IEP unit holders is that in my opinion there has never been a better time than today for activist investing, if practiced properly. Several factors are responsible for this: 1) extremely low interest rates, which make acquisitions much less costly and therefore much more attractive, and 2) the current awareness by many institutional investors that the prevalence of mediocre top management and non-caring boards at many of Americaís companies must be dealt with if we are ever going to end high unemployment and be able to compete in world markets. I believe that the greatly increasing need for a catalyst to make acquisitions possible and to make mediocre managements accountable will be of meaningful benefit to IEP in future years. As a corollary, I expect that low interest rates will greatly increase the ability of the companies IEP controls to make judicious, friendly or not so friendly, acquisitions. That's a love letter to activist investing if I've ever read one. It's a pretty impressive stock chart too. In the last five years, Icahn Enterprises' stock is up 197% (via Yahoo Finance).

Chip East/ReutersU.S. insurers, particularly life insurers, have pushed up their credit ratings by offloading up to $363 billion worth of their own liabilities to off-shore "captive shadow reinsurers," according to an NBER paper by Ralph Koijen of the London Business School and Motohiro Yogo of the Minneapolis Fed. These off-shore captive shadow reinsurers are based in less-regulated jurisdictions like South Carolina and the Cayman Islands. Insurance companies are usually subject to regulations that require them to hold a certain amount of cash for every policy claim they sell. To circumvent this requirement, insurance companies are now setting up "captive" shell companies, usually registered in a low regulation state or country.  The insurance companies then reinsure the policy claims they hold through these shell companies, which means they no longer need to hold the cash reserve on the claim, and divert this excess cash to other uses.  The shell reinsurer, being based in a low-regulation area, usually does not have to hold much cash on its liabilities, and can take on much more risk than the insurance company. Here is a diagram of how it works: Saranya Kapur/BI While reinsurance usually transfers risk from the insurer to the reinsurer, this process of captive reinsurance effectively does almost nothing. When it becomes time for a policy claim to be paid out (when someone dies, for instance), the insurance company still has to pay out the claim, but has lower cash reserves to pay it out from.¬†¬† The claim is then transferred to the shell company, which has even less reserves to pay it out from. The process thus reduces the likelihood of the claim ever being paid out.¬† What's more, these risks aren't reflected in the insurance company's credit ratings.  The NBER paper estimates expected losses from shadow reinsurance to be up to $15.7 billion, and that insurance companies indulging in it should be rated at least three notches lower than their current ratings.  The study finds that shadow insurance as a practice has boomed in the last decade due to a strange mix of stricter federal regulations and looser state-level regulations. In 2000,¬†the federal-level National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted¬†a law known as Regulation XXX, which forced life insurers to hold a much higher level of cash reserves on their claims.  Two years later, South Carolina introduced a law that allowed insurance companies to set up shell reinsurance companies in order to free up reserve cash.  The combination of these two laws has led to a boom in shadow reinsurance, which grew from $11 billion in 2002 to $363 billion in 2012.¬†  The NBER paper is based on a July 2013 report by a New York State Department of Financial Services titled¬†‚ÄúShining a Light on Shadow Insurance: A Little-Known Loophole¬†That Puts Insurance Policyholders and Taxpayers at Greater Risk‚Äù. That report finds that in New York alone, shadow insurance counts for $48 billion.
UBSThe unemployment rate ó determined by the balance between job and labor force growth ó may become "the single most important interest rate determinant over the next few years," according to the UBS economics team. As the unemployment rate falls slowly but surely, many skeptics have pointed to the steady drop in the labor force participation rate (the percentage of adults in the work force). And because future interest rates will be so dependent on the labor force participation rate, UBS takes a look at what the quarterly average unemployment rate will be with various combinations of employment growth and labor force participation rates. Essentially, UBS is looking at what combinations of labor force participation and job growth gets us to a 6.5% unemployment rate ó the rate at which the Fed has said it will consider raising interest rates.†From the note: If the labor force participation rate is unchanged, the so-called ìbreak-evenî rate of household-survey employment growth needed to stabilize the unemployment rate would be near the 100,000 per month observed over the past year. What if the 63.3% labor force participation rate in Q313 were to rise by 0.1 percentage point per quarter over the five quarters through Q414 to 63.8%? In that case, ìbreak-evenî employment growth would need to almost double to nearly 200,000 per month from the recent 100,000 per month. Such calculations also can illustrate the various combinations of the labor force participation rate and household-survey employment growth required to reach the two key unemployment levels that could trigger significantly higher interest rates.† If the labor force participation rate in Q414 is unchanged from 63.3% in Q313, household-survey employment would have to grow by around 185,000 per month to reduce the Q414 unemployment rate to the 6.5% level at which the Fed has said that it would consider starting to raise the Federal funds rate. A cumulative 0.2 percentage point rise in the labor force participation rate to 63.5% by Q414 means that household-survey employment would have to rise by 215,000 per month to achieve a 6.5% Q414 unemployment rate. On the other hand, a cumulative 0.2 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate to 63.1% by Q414 means that household-survey employment would have to rise by just 150,000 per month to achieve a 6.5% Q414 unemployment rate.† With retiring baby boomers likely to continue the "downward tug" on the labor force participation rate, UBS writes that "a†fair working assumption is that it wonít change much, with the second most likely scenario being a further decline."

REUTERS/Gary CameronA tourists uses a video camera atop a Big Bus double-decker tour bus as the tour passes the Federal Reserve Building headquarters in Washington, on the second day of a U.S. government shutdown, October 2, 2013. The Federal Reserve has incredible power, and the decisions it makes have profound implications for the global economy. All eyes are on the Fed as it plans to taper its stimulative quantitative easing program, which consists of the monthly purchases $85 billion worth of bonds. With the Fed getting increasing prominence in the news, more and more people have become self-proclaimed experts on the institution.¬† And this has led to plenty of confusion about where the Fed stands and what it can do from here. "Does the Fed change its reaction function every month?" asked Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Ethan Harris. "Market sentiment around the Fed has swung dramatically in the past six months‚Äîin the spring it was ‚ÄúQE infinity,‚Äù by the fall it was ‚Äútapering regardless of the data‚Äù and more recently some seem to again see QE infinity. This swinging pendulum in part reflects an endless array of exaggerated stories about the Fed exit." In a research not to clients on Thursday, Harris laid out five exaggerated stories and pointed out their problems.: "The Fed call has been and will be about the economy," said Harris. If GDP growth picks up, the Fed will taper. And if inflation stays low, the taper will happen slowly.
Early in the day,†news broke that the company's deal to go private had fallen through, and CEO Thorsten Heins was out of the company. BlackBerry later issued a press release confirming the news. In the release, BlackBerry announced that it would take on $1 billion in convertible debt, which converts if the stock hits $10 a share. Fairfax Financial, which was supposed to lead the BlackBerry deal to go private, will kick in $250 million of the convertible debt. † Fairfax had originally planned to take BlackBerry private in a $4.7 billion deal. It couldn't get the money together, so the deal fell apart.† Here's the release: WATERLOO, ONTARIO and TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Nov 4, 2013) -†BlackBerry (BBRY)(BB.TO), a world leader in the mobile communications market, today announced that it has entered into an agreement pursuant to which Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("Fairfax") and other institutional investors (collectively, the "Purchasers") will invest in BlackBerry through a U.S. $1 billion private placement of convertible debentures. Fairfax has agreed to acquire U.S. $250 million principal amount of the Debentures. The transaction is expected to be completed within the next two weeks. Under the terms of the transaction, the Purchasers will subscribe for U.S. $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured subordinated convertible debentures (the "Debentures") convertible into common shares of BlackBerry at a price of U.S. $10.00 per common share (the "Transaction"), a 28.7% premium to the closing price of BlackBerry common shares on November 1, 2013. The Debentures have a term of seven years. Based on the number of common shares currently outstanding, if all of the U.S. $1 billion of Debentures were converted, the common shares issued upon conversion would represent approximately 16% of the common shares outstanding after giving effect to the conversion. Upon the closing of the transaction, John S. Chen will be appointed Executive Chair of BlackBerry's Board of Directors and, in that role, will be responsible for the strategic direction, strategic relationships and organizational goals of BlackBerry. Prem Watsa, Chairman and CEO of Fairfax, will be appointed Lead Director and Chair of the Compensation, Nomination and Governance Committee and Thorsten Heins and David Kerr intend to resign from the Board at closing. In addition, Mr. Heins will step down as Chief Executive Officer at closing and Mr. Chen will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer pending completion of a search for a new Chief Executive Officer. Today's announcement marks the conclusion of the review of strategic alternatives previously announced on August 12, 2013. "Today's announcement represents a significant vote of confidence in BlackBerry and its future by this group of preeminent, long-term investors," said Barbara Stymiest, Chair of BlackBerry's Board. "The BlackBerry Board conducted a thorough review of strategic alternatives and pursued the course of action that it concluded is in the best interests of BlackBerry and its constituents, including its shareholders. This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favorable to BlackBerry, enhancing our substantial cash position. Some of the most important customers in the world rely on BlackBerry and we are implementing the changes necessary to strengthen the company and ensure we remain a strong and innovative partner for their needs." Ms. Stymiest added, "I am also pleased that John Chen, a distinguished and proven leader in the technology industry, has agreed to serve as BlackBerry's Executive Chairman. I look forward to continuing to serve BlackBerry as a member of its Board of Directors and chair of the Board's Audit and Risk Management Committee. On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Thorsten for his service to BlackBerry over the past six years. Under his leadership, BlackBerry established a more efficient cost structure, developed new products, saw the adoption of BES 10 and delivered the BlackBerry 10 platform. These are all significant accomplishments. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him well in his future endeavors." "Fairfax is a long-time supporter, investor and partner to BlackBerry and, with this investment, reinforces its deep commitment to the future success of this company," said Prem Watsa, Chairman and CEO of Fairfax. "I look forward to rejoining the BlackBerry Board and to working with the other directors and management team, under John Chen's leadership, to shape the next stage of BlackBerry's strategy and growth." "I am pleased to join a company with as much potential as BlackBerry," said Mr. Chen. "BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential - but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success. I look forward to leading BlackBerry in its turnaround and business model transformation for the benefit of all of its constituencies, including its customers, shareholders and employees." The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Pursuant to the Transaction agreement, the investors have an option to purchase up to an additional U.S. $250 million principal amount of Debentures within 30 days following closing. If an additional U.S. $250 million of Debentures is issued and all U.S. $1.25 billion of Debentures were converted, the common shares issued upon conversion would represent approximately 19.2% of the common shares after giving effect to the conversion, based on the number of common shares currently outstanding. About John Chen John Chen previously served as the chairman and CEO of Sybase Inc., beginning in 1998. Under Mr. Chen's leadership, Sybase was transformed from a mature technology company into a high-growth enterprise data management, data warehousing, mobility management and analytics innovator that was acquired by SAP AG in 2010.

More than a decade ago, Kmart was Wal-Mart's biggest rival.¬† But today the Sears-owned chain is in a tailspin, plagued by negative sales and disinterested customers. Last year, the company closed 100 stores after a disastrous holiday season.¬† Brian Sozzi at Belus Capital Advisors visited several Kmart locations and took photos that illustrate how grim it is at the retailer.¬† "The research and photos presented below show that Kmart, believe it or not, may be in worse¬†fundamental shape than Sears!" Sozzi writes. "By fundamental I mean dreadful to visit, borderline unsafe stores that are sending the division‚Äôs financials down a path of no return." Kmart's welcome message is obscured by metal carts. "Welcome to Kmart, we want you to walk into these metal fixtures on wheels while you are texting on the new iPhone 5s," Sozzi writes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  Kmart isn't making an effort to wow the customer. "In the case of this tired display, you get a depressed feeling before ever even stepping into the store," according to Sozzi.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  The display problem continues inside the store. "Yes, that is a bent in half paper sign telling the consumer 'please buy these products.' Sozzi writes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  The electronics section is confusing. "An industrial rack, next to a folding table, next to the aforementioned random washing machine, nearby the Atari-type point-of-sale system," Sozzi notes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  One of the cooler lights is out, which could give a customer the impression that food is old or expired.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  The brown corrosion on the floor below these car batteries caught Sozzi's eye.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  This is what he found below the shelves. "Is this exposure safe for customers and employees?" he asks.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  These clothing racks are outdated, showing that Eddie Lampert isn't investing in his stores. The shelves are also understocked, which could mean that customers who even want to buy the jeans would be unable to.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  This shoe display of ugly boxes isn't alluring to customers. "A consumer that doesn‚Äôt come to Kmart for a boot can‚Äôt even be enticed to buy a boot from across the store if there are is no display product that is at the eye level," Sozzi notes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  And this bare shoe display is made even more pitiful by a broken light in the ceiling:¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  ¬†These empty shelves are a problem. "If you have no items to place here, why not dissemble the shelf to improve the department‚Äôs appearance?" Sozzi asks. "This display looks as if Kmart is liquidating." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  Kmart's holiday display is woefully incomplete.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  This display for Black &amp; Decker was actually yellowing in person, Sozzi said. The table should have more merchandise and looks alarmingly empty.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  The plastic on these Craftsman gift packages was dusty, giving the impression it had been sitting for a long time.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  "Here is a random washing machine sitting in the electronics section, next to the DVDs," Sozzi notes. "And yes, the rug is torn up on the bottom right."¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  Even Kmart's registers are outdated. "Pictured is one of the most outdated point of sale terminals I have seen in recent memory.¬† It sits off in the electronics section.¬† Oh, and all of those wires are exposed to the paying consumer," Sozzi writes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  The stockroom is highly unorganized, and the open door leaves Kmart vulnerable to theft.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  Stores often put complementary items next to each other to encourage purchase, but not Kmart. "Here we have luggage and coolers, summer items, shown next to cold whether items in ice melt and Craftsman snowblowers," Sozzi writes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  This closed portrait studio or hair salon gives Kmart a doomed, glum feel for the customer. Employees attempted to disguise this with a random merchandise rack:¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  While major competitors like CVS and Costco are displaying wrapping paper in the front of the store, Kmart's is placed at random in an empty area. "It‚Äôs almost as if Kmart doesn‚Äôt want to pocket a sale," Sozzi writes.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  This John Cena display is horribly understocked.¬† Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors  As you exit Kmart, there is a missing letter from the sign thanking you for your business.  "This is akin to a kick in the face of the consumer," Sozzi writes. "You want a patron to your establishment to feel appreciated for having plunked down their hard earned dollars." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors   ¬†

Deutsche Bank The trends in gasoline prices haven't gotten a ton of attention in the media, but on Wall Street people are starting to pay more attention. Prices at the pump have been pretty benign this year, and there's a belief (or at least a hope) that this is going to provide some level of economic stimulus. Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna notes: Gas prices provide a gentle nudge:† Earlier this year, as geopolitical tensions were heating up in the Middle Eastóparticularly in Syriaówe highlighted the potential economic damage which could be inflicted if energy prices surged. We noted at the time that gasoline prices were actually providing modest stimulus to consumers, but we doubted it would last if the situation escalated into a military operation. In fact, the diplomatic resolution and subsequent drop in oil and gasoline prices has led the implied ìenergy-stimulusî to endure, which may be part of the reason household spending has shown resilience in the face of recent declines in consumer attitudes.†† Yesterday, Rob Wile wrote about the latest analysis from Macroeconomic Advisers, which had this to say about the impact of falling gasoline prices: Falling energy prices are contributing to gains in real wealth and income:†Retail gasoline prices have declined more than 30 cents / gallon over the last two months, to $3.28/gallon as of Thursday, according to the national average pump price compiled for AAA. November gasoline futures have declined by a similar amount. We estimate that the CPI for gasoline declined by roughly 3% to 4% in October, after seasonal adjustment. If retail prices hold near current levels, the CPI for gasoline in November would be roughly unchanged after seasonal adjustment. Over the last eight weeks, the spot price of WTI has declined approximately $15 to near $95/barrel. So while the economy is pretty meh, this is providing some hope.
If you rely on a portfolio of shares for some or all of your income, it's important to find companies that can be trusted not to cut their dividends. Better still, though, are the companies that keep raising them. Quite simply, many pensioners depend on these payouts to supplement their pension ‚Äì and retirement may last decades. A dividend stream that fails to rise will be severely degraded by the effects of inflation over such long periods. Research from JP Morgan brings home the importance for all investors of picking companies that grow their dividends, rather than those with a high current yield on each share. The investment bank said someone who bought all the high-yielding stocks of the MSCI World Index in 1988 would have seen their money grow roughly 10-fold, whereas investing in high-yielding stocks that also offered high dividend growth multiplied their original money by 20 over the same period. So how can you find companies that consistently raise their dividends? Last month on the Telegraph website, we identified some of the British companies that had long records of maintaining or raising dividends every year . Shell, for example, has not missed a payment since the war, while Cobham, the company that pioneered in-flight refuelling, has a record that stretches back 43 years. But there is no need for income seekers to confine themselves to British firms ‚Äì there are plenty in the United States, Europe and farther afield that have similar or better dividend records. In fact, income investors who limit their holdings to British companies cut down their options drastically. If you want to find companies that yield 3pc or more, widening your search from Britain to the rest of the world increases the number of possibilities 10-fold, according to JP Morgan. It said there were only three industrial companies in the UK with a dividend yield of more than 3pc, but 37 in the rest of the world. It's a similar story in other sectors. Meanwhile, 270 US companies in the S&amp;P 500 index have increased their dividend so far this year and the average dividend increase was about 28pc. That compares with just single-digit dividend growth in the UK, the bank added. The US seems to be better at producing companies that can grow their dividends without interruption for decades at a time. Stock market indices that consist exclusively of such companies illustrates this trend. S&amp;P has "Dividend Aristocrats" indices for Britain, America and Europe. To qualify for the US Dividend Aristocrats index a company must have a 25-year record of paying dividends that rise from one year to the next ‚Äì and 52 shares currently make the grade. But this hurdle is too high for Britain and Europe, so S&amp;P has cut the requirement for entry to these indexes to just a 10-year record. Companies must meet various other criteria to be included. Here are some of the American firms with exceptional dividend records. Exxon, the oil company, has been paying dividends for 131 years ‚Äì since 1882. It has increased the payments consecutively for the past 28 years. Coca-Cola and Colgate Palmolive have both been paying dividends for more than 100 years, while Dover, a diversified global manufacturer, and Genuine Parts Company, which makes automotive and other components, have both raised their dividends for more than 50 years in a row. Among the companies to qualify for the US Dividend Aristocrats index by increasing their dividends every year for at least the past 25 years are Stanley Black &amp; Decker, the tool maker, Consolidated Edison, the energy company, Procter &amp; Gamble, AT &amp; T, Illinois Tool Works, T Rowe Price, an asset manager, 3M, Abbott Laboratories, the drugs maker, and Chubb Corporation, the insurer. Europe produced a smaller number of striking dividend records. Nestl√© has not cut its dividend since 1959, when the payment was 0.023 francs. Its dividend last year was 2.05 francs ‚Äì an 89-fold increase over a period of 53 years, which is equivalent to an average annual rise of 8.8pc. The stock is forecast to yield about 3.5pc this year. L'Or√©al and Roche have increased their dividends every year for the past quarter of a century, with compound annual growth of 15pc and 17pc respectively. L'Or√©al's yield isn't particularly high, with a forecast this year of just over 2pc, but the consistency of the payment "makes the company attractive to investors who are looking for a stable income", J P Morgan said. Roche's yield is more attractive with a 3.3pc forecast for this year, which thanks to continued growth should be more than 3.8pc in 2015. Novo Nordisk, the Danish company that makes diabetes treatments, also has a 25-year record of paying rising dividends; Kerry Group, the Irish food ingredient producer, managed 24 years. Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank that has a growing branch network in Britain, has cancelled the dividend only twice ‚Äì in 1922 and 1992 ‚Äì in the 142 years since its founding in 1871. Alex Robins, client portfolio manager of the JP Morgan Global Dividend fund, said he was a big supporter of companies with this kind of dividend record and of indices that sought to include them. "If we get another crisis and you have your money in these 'dividend aristocrats', your income shouldn't be cut," he said. "The flip side is that, if we get a recovery, sectors such as banking and technology are likely to rally strongly and you would miss out on that." He said the financial crisis had weeded out a lot of companies ‚Äì including banks, technology firms, builders, car makers and their suppliers ‚Äì that might previously have qualified for a dividend aristocrats index. "The hurdles to get into these indices are now extremely high," he said. For all the latest investing news, Follow @telegraphinvest or like us on Facebook at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting 
Wikimedia CommonsThe market keeps on making new highs and volatility is virtually non-existent. Even a concerted effort by politicians in Washington DC to shake the market's confidence was a total failure. The widespread belief is that growth will continue to be mediocre, inflation will be non-existent, the Fed won't do anything to tighten, and that asset prices will go up. Meanwhile, China will do its thing and Europe won't collapse. So there's just not that much to worry about. In a note to clients, JPMorgan's head of asset allocation, Jan Loeys explains the one big risk: Paradoxically, low growth does not contradict higher asset prices, but is at its roots, as a weak recovery induced policy easing, which boosted asset prices. This summer's taper-talk crisis highlights that a sudden spurt in growth is the biggest risk to asset reflation. A gentle grind up is our preferred scenario. So if growth started happening fast, or if (presumably) inflation started taking off in the absence of decent growth, then markets would have a problem on its hands.
DassaultA new generation of the super rich buying expensive properties in London are providing a spin-off for the corporate and private jet market. Hangar8, the Aim-listed charter, leasing and aircraft management business, says the influx has increased demand for large private jets in the UK and contributed to fleet expansion. Hire rates range from about ¬£3,000 to ¬£10,000 an hour. The company has added another six Bombardier Global 5000 long-distance business jets to its fleet this year to meet demand stimulated by the increase in what are described as ‚Äúultra-high net worth individuals‚Äù living in London and the growth in traffic from major companies in the oil, gas and mining industries. Dustin Dryden, the chief executive, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now seeing the second or third generation of moneyed people from Russia, west Africa, Kazakhstan and elsewhere moving into London and we have to expand to cater for them. ‚ÄúThe children have been to London schools and they‚Äôre bringing their own children over now, but they fly all over the world. To illustrate what‚Äôs been happening, probably less than 10pc are British.‚Äù Hangar8, formed in 2002 and based in Oxford, now manages 50 aircraft after doubling the size of its long-distance fleet. The acquisition of International Jet Club has provided a boost for the group and Mr Dryden wants to complete another deal for a company with a market capitalisation of around ¬£10m in the current financial year. Figures for the year to the of end June, to be released on Nov 14 will show Hangar8 had an ‚Äúexceptionally good year‚Äù, said Mr Dryden. He sees more opportunities for acquisitions ‚Äúbecause the desire to travel at the moment is not as great as expected‚Äù and feels the market has recovered from the era of the ‚Äúbucket and spade and skiing brigade‚Äù charter holidays. 
The latest PMI Manufacturing data for Europe is out this morning. Mostly things are roughly in line with expectations. The overall Eurozone number was 51.3, indicating modest expansion. Here's the breakdown by country, and as you can see performance is not consistent. France really seems to be flagging again. Also Greece's momentum has broken a bit. On the other hand, the stronger nations (Germany and Ireland) are both looking good. Markit
Flickr/Scott AbelmanAnother day, more green. Stocks around the world are going up. It's nothing too huge, but US futures are up to the tune of 0.3%. European markets are up about the same level. In Asia, Japan was closed while China was basically flat. Already today we've got a series of decent European PMI reports that came in roughly as expected. This week will be big in terms of economic data (it's Jobs Friday this week) as well as the ECB.
