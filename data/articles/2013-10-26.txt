Margin Call "The S&amp;P 500 now trades above our year-end 2013 price target of 1750," writes Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin in his latest note. "Consequently, three questions dominated discussions this week: (1) the forward path of the US equity market; (2) prospective return of the S&amp;P 500 compared with other global stock markets; and (3) investment strategies through year-end after a stellar 22% rally during the first 10 months of 2013." On the first question, Kostin says the debate among Goldman clients can be characterized in three words: "Fama vs. Shiller" (the names of two economists who won this year's Nobel Prize in economics). He writes: Bullish investors point to Famaâ€™s "efficient market" thesis and argue that current prices incorporate all known information. Put simply, the stock market always trades at fair value. Stated alternatively, the 17% YTD P/E multiple expansion reflects improved domestic economic fundamentals and the expectation of sustained low interest rates. Goldman Sachs US Economics believes the tapering of QE3 will not begin until March, However, many investors believe the Fed will not curtail its bond-buying before June. Several of the approaches we use to estimate the fair value of the stock market support the current level of roughly 1750. For example, the return on equity (ROE) for the S&amp;P 500 equals 15.5%, a level of profitability that is typically associated with a Price/Book Value (P/B) ratio of 2.5x. S&amp;P 500 now trades at 2.6x trailing book value, in-line with the 10-year average. During nine P/E multiple expansion cycles since 1982 S&amp;P 500 troughed at an average of 10x and peaked at an average of 15x. Consistent with this pattern, the current cycle started in September 2011 at 10.6x and the S&amp;P 500 now trades at 15.5x our top-down EPS estimate of $116 for 2014 and 15.2x consensus bottom-up forecast of $121. In contrast with efficient market disciples, behavioral economists believe markets sometimes deviate from fair value. The cyclically- adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE) popularized by Robert Shiller values the market using trailing ten year reported earnings. According to this metric, S&amp;P 500 now trades at 24.5x. If the market reverted to its 80-year average CAPE of 17.7x the S&amp;P 500 index would trade at roughly 1450 or 30% below the current level. Kostin says Goldman's house view is that the "S&amp;P 500 trades at fair value and the forward path of the index will follow the trajectory of profit growth." The bank estimates S&amp;P 500 EPS ofÂ $108 in 2013, $116 in 2014, $124 in 2015, and $131 in 2016. On the second question, Kostin says the prospects for U.S. stocks pale in comparison with those for Japanese and European equities. "We forecast TOPIX will gain 16% to 1400 by the end of 3Q 2014," he writes. "Our prospective 12-month S&amp;P 500 return of 6% also trails Europe where we expect Stoxx 600 will gain 9% to our target of 350." As far as trading strategies over the next two months go, Kostin believes the best bet is stocks with high total cash return, as he thinks the S&amp;P 500 will trade sideways through the remainder of the year. "When the S&amp;P 500 trades in a +/-5% band during a three-month period, stocks with a combination of high buyback yield and dividend yield have outperformed 72% of the time since 1995," he says. Stocks in Goldman's "total cash return to shareholders basket" includeÂ GME, RAI, MPC, AIG, PFE, PNR, YHOO, ARG, T, &amp; DUK, among others. In the week ended Wednesday, October 23, global equity funds saw inflows of $21.4 billion â€” led by U.S. funds, which increased assets under management by $11.5 billion. Inflows into European equity funds were $5 billion â€” the biggest week ever for the asset class. In recent weeks, some shops have been building the case for European equities vis-a-vis their U.S. counterparts. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's asset allocation team, for example,Â released a report arguing that the S&amp;P 500 would drop 15%Â when the Federal Reserve winds down its quantitative easing program in 2014, then go nowhere for years. "Strategically, we advise investors to switch into eurozone and Japanese equities, where economic policy is much clearer, monetary policy very loose and positioning is low," said SocGen's global head of asset allocation, Alain Bokobza, in the report. SocGen equity strategist Paul Jackson followed up the report withÂ 12 charts making the case for European stocks. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid, Business Insider
REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz A man walks past a Twitter banner while leaving JP Morgan headquarters, before Twitter's IPO in New York October 25, 2013. NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange on Saturday did a test run of Twitter's highly anticipated market debut, as it seeks to avoid the types of problems that plagued Facebook's initial public offering on rival Nasdaq.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Big Board, run by NYSE Euronext, regularly does systems testing on the weekends, but this was the first time it had run a simulated IPO, and it did so at the request of its member firms - many of whom took part in Facebook's 2012 IPO on Nasdaq OMX Group's main exchange.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The NYSE was testing mainly for two things: To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO; and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It can also be seen as part of NYSE's struggle with Nasdaq for supremacy in technology listings. Both exchanges vied to be home to Twitter's stock, and many analysts said the trading disruptions that occurred on Facebook's Nasdaq debut likely played to NYSE's favor, as it tries to become the destination of choice for technology listings, something Nasdaq once dominated.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Twitter, which intends to sell 70 million shares at between $17 and $20 each, will be holding the biggest Internet IPO since Facebook, which sold a much larger 421 million shares at $38 each. Twitter is expected to start trading as early as November 7.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the case of Facebook, the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading exposed a glitch in Nasdaq's system, ultimately preventing timely order confirmations for many traders, leaving them unsure about their exposure for hours, and in some cases for days afterwards. Major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $500 million in the IPO.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The absence of Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld while the meltdown was occurring magnified the criticism toward the exchange - he had been celebrating the debut at Facebook's California headquarters before jumping on a plane back to New York.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Nasdaq was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - the largest fine ever for an exchange - and said it would voluntarily pay up to $62 million to compensate firms that had been harmed. On Friday, Nasdaq said $41.6 million of claims put forward qualified for the compensation plan.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The chaotic debut also contributed to a decline in Facebook's stock. The stock hit a low of $17.55 in August, though it has since more than recovered the losses, closing on Friday at $51.95, well above its IPO price.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  While Nasdaq had tested its systems in the lead-up to the IPO, allowing member firms to place dummy orders to a test symbol over a specific period, it limited the total number of orders that could be received in the simulation to 40,000. On the day of the IPO, over 496,000 orders were placed before the IPO opened, with around 82 million shares traded. By the end of the day, more than 500 million shares had traded hands, a record for an IPO.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  NYSE's tests on Saturday ran hundreds of thousands of orders, with one single firm placing an order at one point for nearly 81 million shares.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  "This morning's systems test was successful, and we're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate," an NYSE spokesman said. "We are being very methodical in our planning for Twitter's IPO, and are working together with the industry to ensure a world-class experience for Twitter, retail investors and all market participants."Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  THREE TEST IPOSÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On an average trading day, there are around 700 people on the floor of the Big Board dressed in business suits, many also wearing blue jackets with their firms' names emblazoned on them.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On Saturday, about 20 people - floor operators, technicians, and designated market makers, who are akin to air traffic controllers for stocks, overseeing trading and ensuring fair and orderly markets - gathered in small groups around various screens, dressed in jeans and sipping coffees.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At 7 a.m., just as they would for an actual IPO, over 20 NYSE member firms began sending in their orders for the Twitter IPO simulation. The market opened up as it normally would at 9:30 a.m., but in this case using data from Friday to recreate a normal environment with 3,800 listed stock trading. IPO orders kept coming in and NYSE had a phone line open to keep members apprised of the situation and to answer questions.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Shortly before 10 a.m., the first of three test IPOs to mimic the Twitter debut took place, using the symbol IPOA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The designated market maker (DMM), in this case a representative from Barclays, ran the auction, with orders coming in electronically on a screen and from brokers on the floor using hand-held computers.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A major difference between NYSE's system and Nasdaq's is that Nasdaq's is fully electronic, while NYSE's normal IPO procedures include human intervention, through the DMM.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Once a price had been determined, based on the orders that had come in, and following communication with the investment bankers and brokers, the DMM froze the order book and hit a blue "DONE" button on his keyboard. Immediately after, alerts went off on the brokers' handheld devices indicating their orders had been executed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A NYSE employee on the floor wearing a Bluetooth earpiece, who was connected to the call with member firms, called out the action as it happened.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The exercise was completed two more times, using test symbols IPOB and IPOC, with KCG Holdings and Goldman Sachs as DMMs, and with saws and drills buzzing in the background from weekend renovations, instead of the usual din of traders.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Both NYSE and Nasdaq have said 2013 is shaping up to be their best IPO year in more than half a decade.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (Reporting by John McCrank; editing by Gunna Dickson)
Traditionally, the dove label has referred to an emphasis on the Fedâ€™s mandate to pursue full employment (even at the expense of slightly higher inflation), while the hawk label has referred to a focus on the Fedâ€™s price stability mandate. In practice, however, the dove-hawk distinction typically comes down to a question of the money supply: to increase, or not to increase? First, we must define what measure of the money supply we are talking about. While it is true that the Fed has turned on the money pumps in the wake of the 2008 crisis, the Fed only directly controls what is known as state money, also known as the monetary base, which includes currency in circulation and bank reserves with the Fed. The vast majority of the money supply, properly measured, using a broad metric, is what is known as bank money. This is money produced by the private banking sector via deposit creation, and it includes liquid, money-like assets such as demand deposit andÂ savings deposits. Steve H. HankeThe Fed has indeed been quite loose when it comes to state money, with the state money proportion of the total money supply increasing from 5% of the total before the crisis, to 20% today. Given Yellenâ€™s support for continuing the Fedâ€™s interest rate and easing policies, it would appear that, when it comes to state money, Yellen is indeed a dove. But, where does Yellen stand on the other 80% of the money supply? To answer this question, we must look not to her stance on monetary policy, per se, but rather on financial regulation. For some time, I have warned that higher bank capital requirements, when imposed in the middle of an economic slump, are wrong-headed because they put a squeeze on the money supply and stifle economic growth. Thus far, the result of efforts to impose these capital requirements has been financial repression â€” a credit crunch. This has proven to be a deadly cocktail to ingest in the middle of a slump. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, politicians, regulators, and central bankers around the world (including Yellen) have pointed their accusatory fingers at commercial bankers. They assert that the keys to preventing future crises are tougher regulations and more aggressive supervision, centered around higher capital requirements for banks. This would be fine if higher capital requirements were being imposed during an economic boom, because capital hikes cause money supply growth to slow, which tends to cool down the economy. But, when capital hikes are imposed during a slump, they become pro-cyclical and actually make things worse. Indeed, the imposition of higher capital requirements in the wake of the financial crisis has caused banks to shrink their loan books and dramatically increased their cash and government securities positions. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) quietly acknowledge that this will hamper GDP growth and raise lending rates. But, thus far, they have failed to fully assess the negative impact of raising capital requirements during an economic slump. The problem is that they are not properly focused on the money supply. Indeed, when viewed in terms of money â€” bank money, to be exact â€” the picture comes into sharp relief. For a bank, its assets (cash, loans and securities) must equal its liabilities (capital, bonds and liabilities which the bank owes to its shareholders and customers). In most countries, the bulk of a bankâ€™s liabilities (roughly 90 percent) are deposits. Since deposits can be used to make payments, they are â€œmoney.â€ Accordingly, most bank liabilities are money. To increase their capital-asset ratios, banks can either boost capital or shrink risk assets. If banks shrink their risk assets, their deposit liabilities will decline. In consequence, money balances will be destroyed. The other way to increase a bankâ€™s capital-asset ratio is by raising new capital. This, too, destroys money. When an investor purchases newly-issued bank equity, the investor exchanges funds from a bank account for new shares. This reduces deposit liabilities in the banking system and wipes out money. So, paradoxically, the drive to deleverage banks and to shrink their balance sheets, in the name of making banks safer, destroys money balances. This, in turn, dents company liquidity and asset prices. It also reduces spending relative to where it would have been without higher capital-asset ratios. Steve HankeThe United States, with Yellenâ€™s blessing, has employed a loose state money/tight bank money monetary policy mix. Yes, for all the talk of QE3 and Fedâ€™s loose monetary policy, the inconvenient truth is that the overall money supply in the U.S., broadly measured, is still, on balance, quite tight â€” thanks in large part to ill-timed bank capital hikes. With bank money making up 80% of the total U.S. money supply, broadly measured, it should come as no surprise that the U.S. is actually registering a money supply â€œdeficiencyâ€ â€” 10.1% to be exact (see the accompanying chart). Yes, the shrinkage in bank money has far outstripped the Fedâ€™s efforts to boost state money. In consequence, the current money supply is over $1 trillion less than its pre-crisis level. This is bad news for the real economy, particularly the labor market, as money supply growth and unemployment are tightly linked. Steve HankeIf Yellen were truly a dove, she would have been advocating laxity in bank capital requirements and supervision, not stringency. Alas, despite the massive regulatory burden that has been heaped upon the banking system by the Basel III and Dodd-Frank regulatory regimes, and the repeated capital hikes that have been imposed on banks by domestic and international regulators, Yellen is not satisfied. Indeed, she calls this effort "unfinished business.â€Â  These are clearly not the words of a dove, properly understood. Indeed, on the issue of bank regulation â€” specifically its effect on bank money â€” the Queen of the â€œDovesâ€ has unfortunately sipped the same Kool-Aid being served in the current Chairmanâ€™s office.

Sears, once America's golden retailer, is a company in crisis.Â  The company has shuttered hundreds of stores in recent years. The embattled company has been selling some its most profitable stores to raise money.Â  Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, took poignant photos inside of New Jersey Â and New York Sears locations.Â  "To understand why Sears is in a 'sell stores mode' one must look no further than the stores themselves, where the truth is to be found," Sozzi writes.Â  His photos show the sad reality of what Sears is today.Â  Sears' mannequins are outdated in comparison with competitors like Macy's, Lord &amp; Taylor, and JCPenney, Sozzi says. "If you are living darn near paycheck to paycheck, does this presentation excite you about making a purchase with a couple saved up electronic dollars?" Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors Sozzi points out that this display is confusing. "Huh? A random football themed carpet with no promotion around it?" he says. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors "Whatâ€™s the deal in the back of this electronics department?" Sozzi asks. "Does Best Buy look like this? Or, how about the electronics sections at Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, and BJâ€™s Wholesale? Nope." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors The shoe department isn't adequately stocked, with empty shelves. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors "The team canâ€™t find any way to repurpose abandoned portrait studios into something that drives traffic and sales?" Sozzi asks. "The consistently dark zones give a 'going out of business' feel to nearby departments that actually log some sales, which include appliances and baby." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors Lights are out in the store. "This is not great for flattering a potential customer trying on merchandise," Sozzi writes. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors "This is where the store underinvestment appears loud and ugly," Sozzi says. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors "Attack of the female basics? Look at the lack of organization," Sozzi says. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors Associates weren't on hand to help make purchases in this disorganized department, Sozzi says. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors These displays are almost totally empty. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital AdvisorsÂ  "Toys stacked on a shelf next to an escalator by the shoe department," Sozzi writes. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors Again, Sears is disorganized. "Accessories are some of the only discretionary items selling in the mall with consistency these days," Sozzi writes. "Best of luck navigating this flea market experience." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors The men's department is overwhelming. "Inventory excessâ€¦an entire department of it!" Sozzi says. "Who is in charge of planning and allocation?" Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors The beauty department also lacks innovation in comparison with competitors. "JCPenney has Sephora. Macyâ€™s newly remodeled stores have an array of associates at the ready to assist in cosmetics, ditto Lord &amp; Taylor," Sozzi says. "Ulta stores are popping up everywhere. Sears, well, yeah." Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors "Retail is detail? Not here," Sozzi writes. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors The random clothing racks are confusing to customers and show a lack of organization. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors This mat appears to be shabby and stained. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors Sozzi left the store with an empty cart. Brian Sozzi/Belus Capital Advisors
Courtesy of Pavel KhodorkovskyPavel, Mikhail, and Pavel's mother Elena on Pavel's 18th birthday in Moscow.Pavel Khodorkovsky was in Boston when he first heard of his father's arrest, of how masked men stormed his father's jet at dawn in the Novosibirsk Airport in Siberia, aimed machine guns at him, slapped handcuffs on his wrists, and flew him to Moscow. He heard the news in a phone call from his mother on the morning of Oct. 25, 2003, but it would soon make headlines around the world. "Police in Russia seize oil tycoon," read The New York Times, "Russia's richest man held for fraud" went the BBC's version. Behind the headlines, was a conflict between an oligarch who wanted to open up Russia to business and a new president, Vladimir Putin, who wanted to assert state authority. It was soon clear that the oligarch had lost. A decade later, 28-year-old Pavel is sitting in a nondescript office in Midtown Manhattan, trying to remember what he felt after hearing the news. The office, a former storage room, is now home to a non-profit dedicated to reforming Russia, Pavel's Institute of Modern Russia (IMR). "I was very surprised," Pavel says. "I was 18. I did not fully comprehend the gravity of what was going on and when I last spoke with my dad, he made it clear to me that there was a possibility of his arrest. But he was being so calm about it and talking openly about very high chance of landing in prison — he calmed me down. I didn’t really understand that this was going to happen in the span of the next month." The arrest was a shock, but Pavel still assumed it would blow over. He had flights booked to Russia for the Christmas break, and he planned on using them. Within a few days, however, his father had contacted him through his lawyer. "It was a general parental order," Pavel says — don't come back until I am out of prison. Pavel still has his ticket, but he has never returned to Russia. Instead he has made a life in New York City, where the quiet, charming young man has gradually emerged as his father's spokesperson. It may help that he looks so much like his father, with dark, boyish features and close-cropped hair. October 25, 2013, is the 10-year anniversary of the day that Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested. In that time he has not seen his son, Pavel, once. (Mikhail's three younger children from a second marriage remained in Russia and have been able to visit their father periodically). But in less than a year — next August — Mikhail is due to be released from prison. Whether this will happen and what it means for the Khodorkovsky family, Putin, and the rest of Russia are some of the biggest questions of the year. Courtesy of Pavel KhodorkovskyMikhail with his mother Marina in 1985. Mikhail was 40 years old when he was arrested, and at that time he was seen as one of the brightest stars of Russia's post-Soviet capitalism.  In fact, he was one of the small number of entrepreneurs who had existed within the closing years of Russian communism, and like everything from this period, the exact nature of his rise from rags to riches to jail is murky. Perhaps the best English-language account of how Mikhail made his money was written by David E. Hoffman, the former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post, in his book "The Oligarchs." First published before Mikhail's arrest, the book goes into depth about how a 20-something student began to work in some of Soviet Russia's first experiments in capitalism. Mikhail, the son of two Jewish engineers, had a modest upbringing. As a member of the Young Communist League, however, he worked out a clever way of turning the virtual, communist money that was used by factories for orders (beznalichnye) into real cash. "Starting in 1987, he began to churn the relatively useless beznalichnye into sought-after cash and, even better, into even more valuable hard currency," Hoffman writes. "The full story, even a decade later, is a bit of a mystery, and I discovered that many of those who participated in Khodorkovsky's money machine were reluctant to talk about it." Whatever the source of his newfound cash, Mikhail was able to use it to set up an importing business (while the major import was computers, Hoffman says that rumors suggest brandy and stone-washed jeans also factored in). By the early '90s he was virtually the face of Russia's nascent capitalism, with his own bank, Menatep, and the author of a book celebrating money, "The Man with the Ruble" (one key line: "Our guiding light is Profit, acquired in a strictly legal way. Our Lord is His Majesty, Money, for it is only He who can lead us to wealth as the norm in life"). In "Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin's Russia And The End Of Revolution," Susan Glasser and Peter Baker write that by the early 1990s, Mikhail had "noticed earlier than many that the future would be in oil," and positioned himself as an informal advisor to Boris Yeltsin's energy minister. He slowly began buying up state assets. Then, in 1996, the Mentep group bought the majority of shares in energy giant Yukos. The oil company was one of the spoils of the messy and violent period of post-Soviet privatization, where Russia's oligarch generation was created when the rich paid pennies on the dollar in government auctions and the now-notorious "loans for shares" scheme. The profits were huge, and Mikhail was transported from the realm of very rich to mega rich. APPresident Boris Yeltsin, right, welcomes tycoons Mikhail Khodorkovsky, center, and Vladimir Potanin at a meeting with Russia's most powerful businessmen in the Moscow Kremlin, in this Tuesday, June 2, 1998, file photo.Glasser and Baker write that during the 1998 Russian financial crisis, "Khodorkovsky moved to protect himself with a viciousness that would make him enemies for life." His self-protection included defaulting on huge foreign loans, stiffing the banks when they tried to collect collateral, and pushing American investor Kenneth Dart out of Yukos in a complicated shareholder battle. Those who crossed him grew to fear his wrath. Lee S. Wolosky, a lawyer who represented Dart and later wrote a critical article about Khodorkovsky for Foreign Affairs, told The New York Times that the Khodorkovsky camp were "bullies," and that he and his clients faced "the prospect of physical intimidation." "When you go back to '99-2000, he didn't have a very good reputation at all," says Fiona Hill, an expert on Russia with the Brookings Institute. "He seemed to be same kind of robber baron as a lot of the other oligarchs. He was heavy-handed and ruthless." By the early days of Putin's presidency, however, it appears that Mikhail was trying to make Yukos meet the standards of Western companies — and by some accounts his attempts were successful. "Even though Yukos was conceived in the 'wild East' period of the 1990s," Thor Halvorssen, founder and CEO of the Human Rights Foundation, writes in an email, "by 2000 it had become the most transparent Russian company." "An awful lot of people were trying to work out if this was all sincere," Hill says. "In a way, he was arrested before he could really prove it." As part of bringing Yukos up to Western standards, Mikhail had brought in an American CFO, Bruce Misamore, who joined the company in February 2001. Misamore, who had retired from his position at Penns Energy Company, admits that his research led him to conclude that "Mikhail had a bit of a reputation as a bad boy from a shareholder, governance standpoint," but he was still interested. "The company had brought in a new corporate governance code, and they had engaged several foreign directors, and it appeared that the company was in the midst of a clear turnaround," Misamore said in a recent phone call. "And of course, a big part of this was Russia. Russia seemed to be heading in the right direction under Putin at that point." He felt something had changed at the company, however, and he was excited by the possibilities. Misamore moved to Moscow for the job. As he puts it, the first couple of years were "fantastic," and Mikhail was the "probably brightest person I had ever met." "We were the fastest growing oil company in the world. We were turning a Soviet-style company into a far more westernized company, so we were implementing lots of corporate governance things, financial reporting, an investors relations function, a corporate secretary function," Misamore says. "I tried to set things up in terms of governance to be state of the art, and one of the corporate governance goals, the corporate charter goals, that had been established in 2000, was a listing on the NYSE and we were putting everything in place to do that after all the financial reporting and governance. Really, they only thing we hadn't got implemented by 2003 was the Sarbenes Oxley implementation and that was the next step." The next step was never taken, of course. Misamore was in his apartment on Oct. 23 when he read Mikhail had been arrested. "It was very surprising," he said. "I thought it was not in the best interests of Putin or the country. As it turns out, of course, I had misread Putin's agenda." APThis Sunday, March 4, 2012 file photo shows Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who claimed victory in Russia's presidential election, with tears running down his face up as he reacts at a massive rally of his supporters at Manezh square outside Kremlin, in Moscow. What motivated Mikhail's arrest? One theory is that Mikhail had grown politically ambitious. In the years before his arrest, he had given tens of millions of dollars to various parties, not just in the capitalist parties Yabloko and Union of Right Forces, but also in the Communist Party and even Putin's United Russia.  In Glasser and Baker's account, one source says Mikhail was trying to get one third of the Duma (Russia's parliament) on his payroll, and turn the country into a parliamentary government — with himself as prime minister, and Putin, or someone else, as a figurehead president. Putin not only felt threatened but also felt that Mikhail had violated an agreement with the oligarchs that they could keep their fortunes if they kept out of politics. Another theory is that Mikhail's oil company posed a threat to some powerful people. "He was suddenly changing the way that business was done in Russia," Hill says. "In a way that was really damaging a lot of vested interests all up and down the supply chain." Mikhail was keen to get Yukos up to international standards, and he began to talk publicly about selling a large stake in Yukos to ExxonMobil or Chevron and focusing on public service. "In his efforts to make Yukos more transparent, he was moving to international suppliers, moving towards a way of doing business that was kind of like an alien virus in the old sclerotic Russian economic system," Hill says. "He didn't want to order piping and other things from old, moribund Soviet enterprises, but that was part of the game." Putin's government wanted an oil giant, but it had to be one that played by their rules, Hill says. Pavel says that both political and financial factors played in his father's arrest. "My father was financing the opposition but it wasn’t a secret," Pavel says. "Everyone knew that, including Putin, and it was done with very vocal direct authorization from the man himself. However, the second part, the economical trigger was the fact that Igor Sechin, then deputy Prime Minister, now the head of Rosneft, wanted to appropriate the Yukos company." "Where the two interests were combined was that Putin wanted to obtain enough power both domestically and internationally to try and resurrect the image of Russia as a super nation," Pavel says. That Yukos was destroyed, at least partly, for corrupt reasons has become accepted history. In 2010, the Economist cited one poll that found 63% of Russians believe the destruction of Yukos was orchestrated in the interests of a small group of bureaucrats and businessmen with close ties to the Kremlin. Yukos' group's assets remain in legal limbo to this day. It took less than a year for the oil giant, one of the most spectacularly successful companies in the world, to begin bankruptcy proceedings after Mikhail's arrest. A number of its assets, including the resource-rich Yuganskneftegaz, went up for auction. The only two bidders were Gazprom, a state-oil monopoly, and a company called Baikalfinansgrup, and Gazprom soon had to bow out due to a lack of funds. Writing in Vanity Fair, journalist Masha Gessen points that something about Baikalfinansgrup seemed fishy: For example, its registered address was in the desolate town of Tver, and the office turned out to be an empty space registered to 150 different companies. The company had been registered just a short while before the auction. Fishier still, the company was loaned $9 billion to buy Yuganskneftegaz by none other than Rosneft, the state oil company. The auction lasted just two minutes, and Rosneft would go on to buy Baikalfinansgrup a few days later. Rosneft would later grow to own a number of other Yukos assets. It is now listed as the world's largest listed oil company by output, according to Reuters. Even those within the government were a little confused. Andrei Illarionov, the senior economic adviser to Putin, summed it up as the "scam of the year," and that Russia had moved to a "interventionist model of economic development, with dramatic interference from the state." Illarionov resigned a little over a year later and remains a strident Putin critic. Misamore fled Russia in 2004 during a trip to the country. He was warned he could be arrested if he returned. Since that day he's worked to protect the assets; filing bankruptcy in a U.S. court (which failed), forming two Dutch stichtings to protect Yukos' international assets, and taking the case against Russia to the European Court of Human Rights (it was filed in 2004 but is still in court). The plan is eventually to redistribute what remains of Yukos' assets among its shareholders and creditors and, ideally, seek retribution, Misamore says. "Russia needs to pay the shareholders. They need to compensate them for stealing the company with a fraudulent case," Misamore says. "Until the recent TNK-BP sale, 75% of Rosneft's value was former Yukos assets. It was a valuable asset that the Russians stole and they need to pay for it." Putin's role in the arrest of Mikhail and the destruction of Yukos has often seemed personal — Gessen describes the two men as "central to each other's lives."  "Putin doesn't like Mikhail. As a Soviet person, a KGB person, someone who didn't grow up affluent. I think he's jealous of the people who were successful, and also thought that they got their money improperly," Misamore says. Putin is reported to have privately told Lord John Browne, the former head of BP, "I have eaten more dirt than I need to from that man" before his arrest. Pavel, for his part, thinks this isn't a major factor. "There was another aspect of personal animosity between the two men," he says, "but Putin is a very, very smart individual. I don’t think the personal animosity that existed between them would ever lead to such drastic changes in domestic policy and re-nationalizing whole industries."  Still, many observers have pegged the turning point in Mikhail and Putin's relationship to a meeting in February 2003. The Russian president had invited Mikhail and other oligarchs to the Kremlin, and Mikhail had begun to complain about the sale of a small oil firm to Rosneft for an unusually low price, implying it was a corrupt deal. Putin, according to numerous reports, turned the conversation to Yukos' own huge assets. "The question is, how did they obtain them?" the Russian president said, barely hiding his anger (the clip above, from Cyril Tuschi's excellent feature length documentary "Khodorkovsky," captures the scene). Glasser and Baker's account of the meeting notes that the other oligarchs winced. "It was clear to me that we had just signed our own death warrants," Aleksei Kondaurov, head of the Yukos-Moscow management company later told the authors. "Putin does not take kindly to insults," Hill says. "If you look back at the video of those meetings, you can tell that Khodorkovsky comes out of it knowing that he's stepped over a line." Indeed, while the arrest later that year was a shock to many, in hindsight it appears that Mikhail was resigned to his fate. Alexander Temerko, a close friend and Yukos colleague of Mikhail's at the time, says he was not surprised by the arrest, "and, actually, it was not a surprise for him either." Temerko was responsible within Yukos for dealing with Russia's Ministry of the Interior. He says that when Mikhail was traveling to Siberia, his office heard that the general prosecutor wanted to interrogate Mikhail, and that he would probably arrest him if he did not return to Moscow. Temerko says that his advice was to return and talk to the prosecutor, but Mikhail refused, fearing he would be ordered to stay in Moscow if he returned. When he later heard that Mikhail would probably be arrested, Temerko says he phoned Mikhail again, who told him: "OK, I guess we will say goodbye. Try to save the company and help people: do the best that you can." Even Misamore, who was shocked by the arrest, admits that in hindsight there were signs that Mikhail was expecting it. The two met in Moscow two weeks before his arrest, and he noticed Mikhail had cut his hair down to a short crop. "I subsequently found out that it appeared he was preparing to go to prison by cutting his hair off," he says. It was around 8 a.m. on Oct. 25, as Mikhail boarded a private jet in Novosibirsk, ready to return to Moscow after visiting regional Yukos offices that masked men from the successor to the KGB, the FSB, surrounded him and waved automatic rifles in his face. Mikhail was led out in handcuffs and taken onto a different plane and flown to Moscow. APFormer Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, left in the defendant's cage, and business partner Platon Lebedev seen during a trial in Moscow, Thursday, Aug. 26, 2004. The trial of Mikhail and business partner Platon Lebedev became public spectacles. The pair were kept in a cage in a courtroom. It reportedly measured 47 by 31 by 20 inches. They were kept in Moscow's notorious pre-trial detention centers and escorted to and from court with the type of armed entourage usually reserved for terrorists. In total, dozens of people have been were arrested on Yukos-related charges. Mikhail and Lebedev's first trial ended in 2005, and the pair were found guilty of fraud and tax evasion and sentenced.  In 2011, a second trial found Mikhail and Lebedev guilty of embezzlement and money laundering, effectively convicted of stealing all the oil exported by Yukos between 1999 and 2003. Even those who had ignored the first trial seemed disturbed by the second — U.S. and European governments criticized the verdict, and Amnesty International called Mikhail a "prisoner of conscience." "Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev’s first convictions there can no longer be any doubt that their second trial was deeply flawed and politically motivated," Nicola Duckworth, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia, said at the time. Part of that recognition came from the speech Mikhail gave at the closing of the trial, railing against the power of the "siloviki" (the powerful people in Putin's inner circle) and the predictability of his verdict. "I am not a perfect person, but I am a person with an idea," Mikhail told the court. "For me, as for anybody, it is hard to live in jail, and I do not want to die there. But if I have to, I will. The things I believe in are worth dying for." "I have never been so moved by the words of a businessman," Joe Nocera wrote for The New York Times. Despite international recognition, Mikhail remained in Russia's notorious prison system, where he has faced multiple violations, Halvorssen notes, pointing towards the period when Khodorkovsky was placed in solitary confinement for giving a magazine interview, or the four years he spent in Moscow's notorious pre-trial detention centers, even though these centers are no longer used for economic crimes. "The most horrifying, though, are the stories of Khodorkovsky’s cellmates," Halvorssen adds. "In 2006 one of them was forced to attack Khodorkovsky, and later testified that he was tortured and threatened with murder until agreeing." Despite his conviction, Mikhail still has power, and the Russian government has been unable to get to most of his overseas assets. "He's built a pretty impressive network, in spite of being incarcerated in very nasty conditions," Hill says. Courtesy of Pavel KhodorkovskyPavel and Mikhail driving in Europe in 1999. Pavel says Mikhail was instrumental in his worldview, even though they never saw each other often. He left Russia at the age of 14 to attend boarding school in Switzerland, and he moved to Boston at the age of 18 to attend Babson College. That fall was the last time he saw his father. It took a while for Pavel to become involved in his Mikhail's case — as he puts it he was "too young, too stupid, and ... didn't understand how long this would take." After Pavel graduated from Babson, he moved to New York City to work for a Russian media company. He credits both his father and his Babson education with inspiring him to start his own business, Enertiv in 2011. It wasn't until 2006, at the request of his father's lawyer, that he began speaking publicly about the Yukos case. He later decided to continue the work his father had done with the Open Russia Foundation (a group founded in 2001 loosely modeled on the Soros Foundation that had effectively shut down in 2006) and started the IMR in 2009. Pavel says it is funded with his own money and donations. "The idea was to influence the speed of democratic development back home," Pavel says. "There is no key decision maker, no key trade that would get my father out of jail. The only thing that would help him would be the return to the rule of law and return to democracy back home. It is a very broad goal but this is my motivation." "Thanks to IMR, Khodorkovsky’s case has not been forgotten, despite the state’s efforts to hide him from the public eye in the most remote Russian colonies," Halvorssen writes. APThe son of imprisoned Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Pavel Khodorkovsky, speaks during the award giving ceremony at the Artus House in Gdansk, Poland, Sunday, Sept. 29, 2013.The foundation is in the process of moving from a broad NGO to a think tank focused on democracy, Pavel says. Much of Pavel's work remains related to his father — he recently accepted a $100,000 human rights award from Lech Walesa on behalf of his father, and the foundation is working with a number of other NGOs to host events for the 10th anniversary of Mikhail's arrest. While Pavel has a life in New York with Enertiv and a wife and young child, it's clear much of his attention remains back in Russia. He talks to his father over the phone most Saturdays, but Mikhail must split his allocated 15 minutes between various family members. "Ironically, with my father being in prison, I’m much closer with him now than when  I was 14," Pavel says. "I didn’t know what the hell I would be doing in a couple of years, my father had a very clear vision of what he wanted at 40. Now our interests are very much in sync so we feel like we are much closer." In theory, this could all end next August with Mikhail's release from prison. Even now, however, there are persistent rumors that a third trial is in the works — Der Spiegel reported this week that he may be charged with "being the head of an international network that is allegedly operating against the Russian state." Pavel, for his part, seems optimistic. He points out that Yukos business partner Lebedev is due to be released on May 2, just a couple of months after the Sochi Winter Olympics. Russia is spending a ridiculous amount of money on the Sochi games, part of a clear push to dispel the persistent talk of corruption and inefficiency that lingers around the country. Putting Lebedev back on trial so quickly after the event would be a seriously bad PR move, and if Lebedev gets out it's likely that Mikhail will too. There's also the possibility of amnesty for those convicted of non-violent crimes, as suggested recently by the Kremlin’s human rights council. Still, he has learned not to take anything for granted: "I'm not holding my breath," Pavel says. What would Mikhail do if he is released? Politically, he has been isolated for a decade, and in that decade a lot has changed in Russia. He missed the 2011 Duma election protests that led to large-scale protests in Moscow and other cities, and, while he has corresponded with most of the young opposition movement and seems to be viewed positively, it's not entirely clear if he and, say, Alexey Navalny would work together. Today, the idea of Putinist repression may no longer conjure thoughts of Mikhail Khodorkovsky as much as that of the punk rockers who ended up in jail (Pussy Riot) or the corruption-fighting lawyer who ended up dead (Sergei Magnitsky). The hope, of course, is that Mikhail's 11 years of prison can be turned into something positive. "I do think that having gone through a prison sentence like this, it must be pretty transformative," Hill says. "He didn't flee, he didn't leave the country. He really is like something out of a 19th century Russian novel. He's suffered and become a martyr." Mikhail himself hasn't publicly speculated, but an op-ed he wrote for The New York Times this week demonstrates he remains unafraid to speak his mind. "Today the system for running the country is called 'Vladimir V. Putin,'" he writes, before warning ominously that "Russia runs the risk of seeing another authoritarian regime follow his." Perhaps tellingly, Mikhail mentions Nelson Mandela — another jailed rebel, and one who later went on to head the state that jailed him. So who knows? Mikhail's friend Temerko says that he hopes the man will take some time off to improve his health and that he doubts Mikhail will go into politics or business again, perhaps instead focusing on the non-profit sphere, in particular education, and spending time with his family. "I don’t know what he will do," Pavel says. "I know what I will do. I will try to get him out of Russia as soon as possible because he needs to rest. He needs to do time with his family. We all haven’t seen him in a while. His parents are not feeling that well, my grandparents. We’ll need to be a lot of catch-up will need to be done." Pavel's perspective on Russia itself seems despondent. "I don’t think he’ll get into politics because 'A,' he would risk a third conviction right away and 'B,' it seems like the society is not prepared, regardless of who is at the helm of the opposition," Pavel adds. "It just seems like the society overall is not yet there." "Many times Khodorkovsky repeated that he intends to stay in Russia after his release," Halvorssen writes. "I don’t know whether he intends to ever run for office, but it is pretty clear to me that this man has, is, and will likely continue to shape Russian politics." In short, no one knows what will happen, but people across Russia are wondering. After all, Mikhail's life has in some ways embodied the progress of Russia, from the Soviet era, to Soviet experiments with capitalism, to an oil money oligarchy, to a Russia dominated by Putin. The question is what comes next. As for Pavel — a man for whom much of life revolves around a country he left when he was 14 — could he return? "No," Pavel says, laughing. "Very simple answer, no. It would take the entire country to change."
Wall Street was completely convinced that the Federal Reserve would begin to taper its quantitative easing program following its September FOMC meeting. There were several compelling reasons why it had to happen in September. In short, Committee members had raised concerns over both frothy markets and the economic effectiveness of QE in previous meetings, putting the central bank's credibility on the line by priming market participants for a tapering announcement and doing nothing to change expectations thereof. When the FOMC concluded its meeting on September 18 and announced that it would refrain from tapering on the grounds that economic data weren't improving quickly enough, market participants were completely caught off guard. Bond prices soared as investors re-calibrated their positions to reflect this new reality. "We have never heard investors as angry as the day after the Fed decided to not taper its asset buying program," said BofA Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris. "Some investors argue that it was a deliberate attempt to introduce volatility into the market. Others said Fed credibility is shot." In a recent report, ISI vice chairman Krishna Guha, a former New York Fed official who served as a senior adviser to New York Fed president Bill Dudley until just a few weeks before the FOMC's September decision, sums up nicely the confusion the FOMC has created over the outlook for quantitative easing. Quoting minutes from recent FOMC meetings, Guha writes in a note to clients (emphasis added): The forward guidance on the balance sheet is provided by the QE policy rule. The problem here – as I have pointed out repeatedly – is that there is not one single policy rule but two elements of the policy rule that are not properly integrated.  The first element is the economic outcome based rule – that the committee will continue its purchases of Treasuries and MBS "until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability." The second element is the cost-benefit rule – Committee decisions about the pace of purchases will "remain contingent on its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases." In my opinion the May/June taper talk was a tightening in monetary policy because it was not consistent with the forward guidance on the balance sheet provided by the economic outcome based policy rule. Put another way, it suggested that the Committee was pivoting from the first element of the policy rule to the second (cost-benefit analysis). And markets fell for the head-fake. Then, less than two weeks later, Congress shut down the U.S. government for 16 days, scaring market participants with the prospect of a debacle in which warring parties failed to raise the impending debt ceiling, resulting in a default on U.S. debt. And at the same time that major money-market funds were dumping U.S. Treasury bills, consumer confidence was plummeting. The shutdown was eventually lifted, and a true debt ceiling crisis was averted — at least, temporarily. But the resolution didn't stop Bank of America from slashing its Q1 2014 GDP growth forecast to reflect the next round of fiscal sparring set to take place in January and February, when the current deals struck by Congress this month expire. MarkitAmerican manufacturing output contracted in October for the first time since September 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis.Meanwhile, today we got the first look at the impact the fiscal crisis had on the American economy with Markit's flash October U.S. PMI survey, and it wasn't pretty. American manufacturing output contracted for the first time since September 2009. Manufacturers cited weakening domestic demand for the drop in output, which happened even as new export orders rose, reflecting an improving economic picture overseas. "It is clear from the September minutes that most Fed policymakers thought ex-ante that the no taper decision at that meeting meant taking time out for 6-12 weeks, during which time they would be able to review some additional data in housing and employment in particular, to validate the forecast before starting to taper," says Guha. "However, ex-post it is likely to take much longer to get the data they need to see consistent with the economic outcome based element of the QE policy rule reasserted in September." Initially, when the Fed didn't taper in September, Wall Street analysts and economists quickly coalesced around the view that it would probably do so in December. Then, when the economic effects of the shutdown came into view, expectations were pushed out to January, and now, many say they don't expect the Fed to act until March. Guha, for one, sees chances for when the Fed is most likely to announce the taper like this: 25% in December, 30% in January, 30% in March, and 15% after March. But amid a big rally in the bond market, many are wondering if tapering is quickly becoming a distant September memory. In a new report making the rounds on Wall Street bond trading desks today, Medley Global Advisors analysts Regina Schleiger and Jeremy Torobin argue that, "more than simply standing pat, the Federal Open Market Committee has effectively hit the reset button and is back where it was six months ago — at the very start of a long process of building the case for a downward adjustment to the Large-Scale Asset Purchase program." "That [tapering] eventuality is now a riskier proposition (and, consequently, the process of getting back to within striking distance is more difficult) because of troubling signs that economic momentum is slowing," write the Medley analysts. "The potential costs to financial stability of continuing purchases at the current $85-billion per month may, down the road, start flashing red and embolden FOMC hawks to push for an aggressive conclusion of the program. But right now the potential costs of withdrawing even the slightest bit of support from the economy appear much greater than they were." The consensus on Wall Street is that U.S. economic growth finally takes off in 2014, which will give the Fed the opportunity to taper. But what if it doesn't? Consider this: some believe the U.S. economy is actually entering a "late-cycle stage" — in other words, the upward acceleration may not be coming. "A growing number of indicators are showing late-cycle dynamics, and while this need not imply a recession it might well indicate a shift into a period of slower growth and lower inflation," says Deutsche Bank global head of rates research Dominic Konstam. "So much for animal spirits," he writes in a recent note to clients: All else equal, our investment model that is derived from profits now clearly shows falling investment spend in 2014. So much for animal spirits: the corporate sector has little economic reason to invest, animal or not.  This is also apparent in corporate free cash flow, or internal funds available for investment. The first issue is that corporate cash flow growth has turned negative in recent data – levels not seen since 2007. The second issue is that year-over-year growth in corporate cash flow has historically tended to follow the contribution of labor input to profits, with a four quarter lag. This observation also argues that labor input is the moving part that is used to restore cash flow growth via profits. The recent increase (less negative decrease) in profits attributed to labor input could then be seen as the beginning of attempts to strengthen cash flow, with the bad news being that a positive contribution to profits implies cutting labor input. Labor input is high relative to productivity, which typically predicts a sharply slower labor market 2 years ahead. In fact, simply conditioning on the relative gaps of labor input to productivity when it is negative predicts an almost stagnant labor market. In the absence of further fiscal or monetary stimulus, a lower household savings rate, or some combination of these, the implication is lower, not higher, rates. "This is hardly a recipe for above trend growth," says Konstam. "We note that recent trend real growth is less than 2%, so if inflation is stuck in the 1-1.5% range, then nominal growth is stuck closer to 3%, not 4%. In that environment, nominal yields become restrictive over 3% and become inhibitive to growth." Here, Konstam is talking about a notion that Nomura chief economist Richard Koo has picked up on in recent weeks: that the Fed has backed itself — and the American economy — into a "QE trap." Koo visited U.S. clients and Fed officials in a recent trip, and he said no one was able to refute his theory, which goes like this: the Fed talks about tapering, sparking a rise in long-term interest rates as investors dump bonds. The rise in interest rates then weighs on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy — like housing and automotive — which causes the Fed to call the whole thing off because economic data aren't showing adequate improvement.  "This is ultimately the logic to our argument earlier this year that the sell-off driven by the shock of Fed taper rhetoric and the resulting positioning shift was self-limiting and could be said to preclude, rather than reflect, recovery," says Konstam. Perhaps the FOMC eventually decides that, regardless of the trajectory of economic growth, QE represents too big a stability risk to be worth it, as the Medley analysts suggest. ISI's Guha also foresees such a scenario if the data don't, in fact, improve. "I think we are now in a zone of true data dependency in which QE will be driven almost entirely by the data flow and how this affects the Fed forecast," he says. "I am confident this zone of true data dependency lasts through January and it will probably last through March. By contrast, from the March meeting onwards (if not before) the decision to taper becomes a question of monetary policy strategy, not just data flow – specifically, whether the Fed is willing to contemplate 'QE infinity' in a context of 2% growth."
At first glance, when the CIO of Fortress Investment Group says: "Put a little money in Bitcoin...Come back in a few years and itâ€™s going to be worth a lot." One might think, the firm that manages $54.6 billion is advocating the end of the USD as we know it... Or is this more muppetry at work? Via Bloomberg: â€œPut a little money in Bitcoin,â€ Novogratz, principal and co-chief investment officer of macro funds at Fortress, said at a conference held today in New YorkÂ by UBS AGâ€™s chief investment office.Â â€œCome back in a few years and itâ€™s going to be worth a lot.â€ Novogratz said he sees Bitcoin growing as a payment system, especially in developing nations. Novogratz said he has put his own money in the virtual currency, without specifying how much. He has not invested in Bitcoin on behalf of Fortress, which managed $54.6 billion as of June 30. â€œI have a nice little Bitcoin position,â€Â Novogratz said.Â â€œEnough that Iâ€™m smiling that it doubled.â€ However, color us a little skeptical at his advice... Given that Bitcoin may ultimately make firms like Fortress - that rely on fiat specie - redundant, then doesn't the endorsement of Bitcoin by one of the world's largest Private Equity firms reek of the ultimate failure of BTC as a monetary construct, and seem much more to be merely an attempt by the firm to herd even more momentum chasers into a trade (ostensibly one for Novogratz P.A.) that will be then unwound with Bitcoins ultimately converted into the same dollar they are supposed to replace?
Wikimedia CommonsJean-Paul Laurens' "La Mort de Tibere"Although many people have hailed Ben Bernankeâ€™s response to the current financial crisis for going outside of the box and using unorthodox policies to avoid a financial collapse, in reality, similar policies were used byÂ TiberiusÂ during the Financial Crisis of 33 AD, almost 2000 years ago. TiberiusÂ ruled the Roman Empire from 14Â AD to 37 AD.Â  He was frugal in his expenditures, and consequently, he never raised taxes during his reign. When Cappadocia became a province,Â TiberiusÂ was even able to lower Roman taxes. His frugality also allowed him to be liberal in helping the provinces when, for example, a massive earthquake destroyed many of the famous cities of Asia, or when a financial panic struck the Roman Empire in 33 AD. As with many financial panics, this one began when unexpected events in one part of the Roman world spread to the rest of the Empire. To quote Otto Lightner from his History of Business Depressions, â€œThe important firm of Seuthes and Son, of Alexandria, was facing difficulties because of the loss of three richly laden ships in a Red Sea storm, followed by a fall in the value of ostrich feather and ivory. About the same time the great house of Malchus and Co. of Tyre with branches at Antioch and Ephesus, suddenly became bankrupt as a result of a strike among their Phoenician workmen and the embezzlements of a freedman manager. These failures affected the Roman banking house, Quintus Maximus and Lucious Vibo. A run commenced on their bank and spread to other banking houses that were said to be involved, particularly Brothers Pittius. â€œThe Via Sacra was the Wall Street of Rome and this thoroughfare was teeming with excited merchants. These two firms looked to other bankers for aid, as is done today. Unfortunately, rebellion had occurred among the semi civilized people of North Gaul, where a great deal of Roman capital had been invested, and a moratorium had been declared by the governments on account of the distributed conditions. Other bankers, fearing the suspended conditions, refused to aid the first two houses and this augmented the crisis.â€ At the same time, agriculture had been on the decline for several years, andÂ TiberiusÂ required that one-third of every senatorâ€™s fortune be invested in Italian land.Â  The senators had 18 months to make this adjustment, but by the time the period was up, many senators had failed to make the proper adjustment.Â  This deadline occurred at the same time as the events above occurred, placing a further squeeze on the financial sector. When Publius Spencer, a wealthy noblemen, requested 30 million sesterces from his banker Balbus Ollius, the firm was unable to fulfill his request and closed its doors.Â  Over the next few days, prominent banks in Corinth, Carthage, Lyons and Byzantium announced they had to â€œrearrange their accounts,â€ i.e. they had failed. This led to a bank panic and the closure of several banks along the Via Sacra in Rome.Â  The confluence of these seemingly unrelated events led to a financial panic. To protect themselves, banks began calling in some of their loans. When debtors could not meet the demands of their creditors, they were forced to sell their homes and possessions, and with money unavailable even at the legal limit of 12%, prices of real estate and other goods collapsed since there were so few buyers.Â  A full scale panic followed. The panic occurred not only in Rome, but throughout the Empire.Â  If anyone thinks that it is only in recent times that financial markets have been so fully integrated that the failure of the Creditanstalt in 1931 or Lehman in 2008 could precipitate a panic, they clearly have not read their history.Â  By their nature, financial markets have always been integrated, and failure in one part can create the domino effect which created the Great Depression and was witnessed in 2008. TiberiusÂ had retired from Rome. Although a great general, some feltÂ TiberiusÂ never wanted to be emperor, and he became reclusive in his later years. It took time to contact him and get a response. Several days later, he sent a letter to Rome with measures to alleviate the crisis. The decrees which had precipitated the problem were suspended.Â 100 million sesterces were to be taken from the imperial treasury and distributed among reliable bankers, to be loaned to the neediest debtors.Â  (A loaf of bread sold for half a sestertius and soldiers earned around 1000 sesterces, so if you take an average soldierâ€™s salary of around $20,000, you could say that one sestertius was equal to about $20 today.) The 100 million sesterces was equivalent to around $2 billion. No interest was to be collected for three years; but security was to be offered at double value in real property.Â Â This enabled many people to avoid selling their estates at low prices, stopping the fall in prices and ensuring that the lack of liquidity never occurred.Â Though a few banks never recovered from the panic, most continued business as usual, and the financial panic ended as quickly as it began. If you think aboutÂ Tiberiusâ€™s response, it is little different from what Bagehot would have recommended in Lombard Street, written in1873, or what Bernanke did in 2008. Just as Bernanke expanded the balance sheet of the Fed,Â TiberiusÂ increased liquidity by a huge amount, an early version of the TARP.Â Â TiberiusÂ lowered interest rates to zero for three years to alleviate any additional pain, again, little different from the quantitative easing the Fed has carried out to keep both short- and long-term interest rates low. The financial crisis of 33 AD also illustrates how integrated all parts of the Roman Empire were since it involved not only Rome, but Egypt, Greece and France.Â  The financial panic took place over a period of a few weeks, one collapse precipitating the other, just as problems at Lehman, AIG and Morgan Stanley quickly led to problems in other parts of the financial sector and the real economy. The financial crisis was resolved with Tiberiusâ€™s measures, and the downward spiral was stopped. WhenÂ TiberiusÂ died in 37 AD, he had a fortune of 2.7 billion sesterces, or over $50 billion.Â  Unfortunately, his successor was his son Caligula, who was, to say the least, not as refined in his judgments asÂ TiberiusÂ was.
Good question here in the Ask Cullen page.  I get this one a lot so it’s worth some detailed explanation. First, it helps to understand what the Fed really is.  The Federal Reserve System was modelled after the New York Clearinghouse that existed in New York during the 1800's and 1900's.  As its name states, the New York Clearinghouse was just a big clearinghouse where many of the big banks would come to settle their interbank payments.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t broad enough to handle the scope and complexity of the US banking system so these regional clearinghouses were deficient in dealing with banking crises and liquidity issues.  The Fed System took this private model and ramped it up into a public/private hybrid model to create a national clearinghouse for interbank payments.  You don’t hear much talk about this on a daily basis, but that’s really what the Fed is – it’s just a big clearinghouse to help smooth the payments system.  All the other stuff it gets attention for (like monetary policy) is just a sideshow to this primary purpose it’s serving – to maintain a healthy functioning payments system. But the Fed is a weird entity when it comes to “ownership”.  It exists due to an act of Congress.  But it is also considered an independent entity because it is not part of the Executive or Legislative branches of government.   The Fed exists because Congress created it, but it doesn’t enact policy measures with any Congressional or Presidential approval.  Politically, this makes it a very independent entity. The Regional Fed banks are arms of the Fed system that serve like regional versions of the NY Clearinghouse.   One thing that muddies this discussion on “ownership” is the issuance of stock by the regional Fed banks to the member banks.  This stock pays a fixed 6% dividend and gives the banks a claim on the Fed’s annual profits.   But let’s keep this in the right perspective.  Last year the Fed earned $90.5B.  Of this, $1.6B was paid out in dividends.  The remaining $88B was remitted back to the US Treasury.  While the US Treasury doesn’t technically own shares in the Federal Reserve the Fed is required to remit its profits at the end of the year back to the Federal Government.  As you can see, remittance often dwarfs any dividends paid back to the banks.  In other words, the US Treasury is the recipient of most of the Fed’s profits. Let’s also not forget the primary purpose of the Fed.  Remember, the Fed exists to serve the payments system.  This means it is a supporter of the US banking system.  Before it can ever achieve its dual mandate on price stability and full employment the Fed must ensure the payments system is healthy.  Therefore, the Fed is often viewed as a servant to the banking system while also trying to be a public purpose servant.  It has, in effect, two masters by design. The Federal Reserve system is an imperfect, but rather innovative clearinghouse.  Its structure as “independent within government” makes it hard to decipher precisely who owns it.  I prefer to think of the Fed as being an entity designed to help support the US payments system (which thereby makes it a bank facilitating entity) which serves public purpose and private purpose.  In other words, it’s better to think of the Fed as a public/private hybrid and not really being “owned” by anyone.
