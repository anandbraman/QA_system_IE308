By:  John Browne Tuesday, January 22, 2013 Last week the Bundesbank (the German central bank) surprised markets around the world by announcing that it will repatriate a sizable portion of its gold bullion reserves held in France and the United States. To many, the news from the world’s second largest holder of gold signaled a growing, if clandestine, mistrust among central banks, possibly fueled by diverging policy goals. The Germans have attempted to tamp down the alarm by highlighting the myriad of logistical, practical and historical reasons that qualified the announcement as unremarkable. But the size, scope, and timing of the move makes it hard not to draw more strategic conclusions. Coming during a time of supposed central bank cooperation, the decision to withdraw billions of dollars of bullion was bound to raise eyebrows. At present, Germany has official gold holdings of some 3,396 tonnes. 1,500 tonnes resides in New York and 374 tonnes in Paris. Between now and 2020, Germany will repatriate 674 tonnes of gold – 300 from the Fed in New York (valued at $17.9 billion) and the entire 374 tonne allotment from Paris (valued at $22.3 billion). Although financial leaders like Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke have said that gold “is not money” and senior investors like Warren Buffet have described it as “a barbarous relic,” the movement of gold nevertheless makes a strong emotional impact. Is such a response justified? Coming during a time of supposed central bank cooperation, the decision to withdraw billions of dollars of bullion was bound to raise eyebrows. Although financial leaders like Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke have said that gold “is not money” and senior investors like Warren Buffet have described it as “a barbarous relic,” the movement of gold nevertheless makes a strong emotional impact. Is such a response justified? Following World War II, the threat of a sudden Soviet invasion convinced many Western European nations to diversify their gold holdings abroad, particularly overseas to the U.S and the UK. Today, Germany holds only 31 percent of its gold within the Bundesbank. Of the remainder, 45 percent is held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, 11 percent with the Banque de France in Paris, and 13 percent with the Bank of England in London. But now that the Russian military threat has dissipated, the Germans have rightly reevaluated its dispositions. For decades, central banks have been secretive about their gold holdings. Despite this, few doubt the published aggregate gold holdings of central banks. But serious questions arise as to the precise ownership of the gold held in the vaults of central banks and some commercial banks. To the astonishment of many German citizens and international observers, the Bundesbank admitted some years ago that it had not held an audit of its gold holdings for decades, if ever. (See my prior commentary on this subject) The developed nations of the world have adopted a form of Keynesian economics that has created a world awash with debased fiat currency supported by seemingly unsupportable mountains of official debt. In such a world, it is understandable that German citizens feel their nation’s gold should be held at home. Such sentiment could spread. Holland’s CDA Party already has asked that their nation’s 612 tonnes, or metric tons, of gold be repatriated from the U.S., the UK and from Canada. Some question whether such sentiments will spread and expose even a shortage of physical gold in hitherto trusted vaults. In addition, in a world where trust in central banks is waning fast, central banks themselves may become mistrusting of each other. At the same time, central banks in the developing world, particularly in China and Southeast Asia, are accumulating gold, as are nations like Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. China is now the world’s largest producer of gold worldwide, but she retains her production and even buys more on the open market. This has occurred even while no major central banks are selling significant amounts of gold. The Bank of England’s disastrous selling campaign in the early years of the current century, in which it sold hundreds of tons below $300 per ounce, is no doubt a controlling factor. The unwillingness of central banks to part with their hoarding of gold, highlighted by Germany’s repatriation, contrasts starkly with the central bank policies of the 1970s and 1980s, when concerted efforts were made to de-monetize gold, which could only be done through active selling. Does this change reflect a growing and shared distrust of fiat currency by sophisticated private investors who hoard gold? The repatriation of even a part of Germany’s central bank gold holdings, especially if followed by other nations such as Holland, should be regarded with concern. Today, no central bank would dare to risk rocking the central banking boat. But as the Keynesian economies have slid towards financial disaster, any increase in central bank gold repatriation could indicate a real fear by the great insiders — central banks. A particularly interesting aspect of the announcement that has been largely ignored is the extraordinarily lengthy seven year time period in which the Germans expect to receive back their gold. The 300 tons they’re repatriating from the New York Fed reflects just five percent of the more than 6,700 tons held there. It strikes many as unusual that the Fed would need so much time to deliver what should be a manageable withdrawal. John Browne is a Senior Economic Consultant to Euro Pacific Capital.

Yeah, The Last Remaining Store Of Real Wealth is somewhat tongue in cheek. I'm talking about pensions here, and despite the fact that hundreds of millions of people, especially in the west world, count on the pensions they pay into year after year for decades, to be there for them when they reach a certain age - which gets pushed forward all the time, talk about Receding Horizons! -, I've long since said that for most that is not going to happen. But many still see it that way: The Last Remaining Store Of Real Wealth. I started writing a follow-up on the pensions topic, it's been 5 months or so since I wrote The Global Demise of Pension Plans, and while I don't want to do anything as broad as that article at this point, there are developments that warrant what could be labeled an update. Alas, though I was plodding along nicely, the material itself somehow got in the way, and it would have become too long and winding. Which means that the original article must wait till later in the week, and today I'm going to have to present you with a kind of riddle. You see, as I was reading through a bunch of recent news pieces, I came upon a Bloomberg article about CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, America's largest public pension fund. It made me think back of a July 21, 2012 Barron's article I cited in The Global Demise of Pension Plans, and it didn't add up at first glance. Here's that older article first, written by Michael Aneiro: Top Pension Fund Sends a Warning The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's biggest public pension fund at $233 billion, reported a mere 1% return on its investments in its fiscal year ended June 30. Earlier this year, in an attempted acknowledgment of today's realities, CalPERS had lowered its discount rate–an actuarial figure determining the amount that must be invested now to meet future payout needs—for the first time in a decade, to 7.5% from 7.75%. That represents combined assumptions of a 2.75% rate of inflation and a 4.75% rate of return. Needless to say, a 1% annual return didn't come close to hitting any of those figures [..] CalPERS was quick to note that its 20-year investment return is still 7.7% [..] Later in the week, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said that the underfunding of S&amp;P 500 companies' defined-benefit pensions had reached a record $354.7 billion at the end of 2011, more than $100 billion above 2010's deficit. The organization reported that funding levels at the end of 2011 ran around 75%, on average, and that future contributions will constitute a "material expense" for many companies. Fitch Ratings later released its own study of 230 U.S. companies with defined-benefit pension plans and found that median funding had dropped to 74.4% in 2011 from 78.5% in 2010, and that corporate pension assets grew just 2.9% in 2011 amid sluggish returns and a 6% decline in contributions.   [..]Interestingly, at a time when bond interest rates are so depressingly poor, fixed-income investments constituted the second-best performing asset class for CalPERS last year, returning 12.7%, no doubt thanks to price gains for high-grade bonds. That result trailed only the fund's 15.9% return on its real-estate investments. What derailed CalPERS, then? Losses of 7.2% on stock investments, 11% on forest-land holdings and 2% on absolute-return assets.   From the bleachers: A "15.9% return on its real-estate investments"? In the moribund 2011-12 US housing market? Really? How does that work? And that's not all: here's a quote from a WSJ article you'll find below:   CalPERS real estate portfolio return for the three year period ending in June [2012] wasn't as pretty: it lost 24%, according to Wilshire Consulting.   Looks like maybe we need to make a choice here; I don't see how all these things can be true at the same time. On January 21, 2013, exactly 7 months after the first article I quoted, Michael B. Marois writes the following for Barron's, and I can't seem to figure out how the transformation is possible:   CalPERS Buy-Hold Rule Recoups $95 Billion Recession Loss The California Public Employees’ Retirement System is poised to top a record $260 billion in assets, the market value it held before the global financial crisis wiped out more than a third of its wealth, by sticking with a strategy of buy-and-hold. The largest U.S. public pension, with half of its money in publicly traded equities, was worth $253.2 billion on Jan. 17, or about 97% of the pre-recession high set in October 2007. The fund returned 13% in 2012, about the same gain as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index achieved. "A lot of the improvements in portfolio returns is simply reflective of the return of the market," Chief Investment Officer Joe Dear said in an interview. "But there is still an important lesson there, which is that when the crisis was full on, we didn’t drastically reduce our equity exposure." CalPERS isn’t alone in nearing previous high marks. The 100 largest public pensions in the U.S. had $2.9 trillion in assets in the fourth quarter of 2007, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. That dropped to $2 trillion in 2009 and rebounded to almost $2.8 trillion as of Sept. 30. The median funded status of state pensions, meaning how much money a system has in order to pay its obligations, fell to 72% in 2011 from 83% in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even with its gains, the Sacramento-based pension is still short $87 billion, or about 26%, of meeting its long-term commitments, and has had to ask the state and struggling cities to contribute more. One municipality, San Bernardino, sought bankruptcy protection, saying it can’t afford to pay $13 million it owes to CalPERS.   Do you see what's puzzling me? CalPERS had assets valued at $233 billion on June 30 2012, with a 1% return in the fiscal year ending June 30 2012 (i.e. fiscal year 2011). Still, 7 months later, January 17 2013, its assets are worth $253 billion . Also, CalPERS boasted a 1% return on its assets in the fiscal year ending June 30 2012, but a 13% return in the calendar year 2012. That means they made what, 24%-25% in the second half of the year? And the COO claims this was "simply reflective of the return of the market"?!   "It’s certainly good news that the asset base has grown and recovered," said Bradley Belt, senior managing director of the Milken Institute and former executive director of the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. "The bad news is that while you’ve gotten back to where you were on the asset side -- through a combination of good market returns and new contributions -- liabilities never took a holiday. Liabilities are now a whole heck of a lot larger than they were." CalPERS’s value was already in decline when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in September 2008, leading to a panic that wiped out more than $6 trillion in U.S. stock-market value in about six months. By 2009, CalPERS’s value had plummeted to $164.7 billion. Since then, the pension fund has benefited from the stock market’s recovery after the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index touched a 12-year low in March 2009. The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities climbed more than 13% last year and has more than doubled since its low.   CalPERS had assets valued at $164.7 billion in 2009. On June 30, 2012, the number stood at $233 billion (though its real estate portfolio lost 24% over that time). In other words, it had added $68.3 billion, or 41.5%, over 2.5 years, even though its return was just 1% return in the fiscal year ending June 30 2012, as we saw before. The fund then proceeded to add another $20 billion in value in the 6 months after that. Let's read on:   Apart from stocks, CalPERS invests about 17% of its money in bonds, 14% in private equity, 9% in real estate, 4% in cash-equivalents, 4% in inflation- linked holdings such as commodities, and 2% in forestland and infrastructure such as airports and power plants. "We held on to our allocation," the 61-year-old Dear said. "We believed the markets were going to come back and we held our allocation at around 50% and that decision has been justified." After CalPERS’ real-estate portfolio lost almost half its value by the end of the 2009 fiscal year, Dear set out to shrink leverage used to make purchases, got rid of underperforming managers, focus on core income investments such as rental apartments, industrial parks, offices and retail space. It also sold off a fifth of its speculative residential housing. The real-estate unit returned almost 13% in 2012, averaging 6% in the past three years, though that’s still below its internal target of 10%.   OK, if I understand this well, according to Bloomberg, CalPERS real estate averaged a 6% return from end 2009 to end 2012, while according to the Wall Street Journal, which cites Wilshire Consulting, it lost 24% between mid 2009 and mid 2012. You tell me. More CalPERS in an Orange County Register editorial today:   Pension funds still in denial [..] But while union-backed politicians gained power after Nov. 6, the financial problems faced by CalPERS and other funds are growing, especially if Moody's, the prestigious credit-rating service, changes the assumptions it uses for calculating public-employee pension debt. As we've argued before, the math equations will soon overtake the political calculations. [..] CalPERS estimates that its investments will earn a 7.5% rate of return, even though they managed only 1% last year. That's an aggressive and unrealistic assumption, but the higher the projected rate of return, the less the projected debt. This is where the games begin. Supporters of these outsized pension formulas want to hide the amount of debt and the approaching problem by embracing unrealistically high rates of return.  Moody's calls for lowering the assumed rate of return to 5.5%, which still may be too high. Moody's can't force local governments to do anything, but its formulas determining creditworthiness affect how outsiders evaluate the financial health of government agencies and lending rates for bonds. The California Public Policy Center recently released a new report by financial expert John Dickerson, analyzing the effect of the Moody's proposed new rate on six Northern California counties. His conclusion: "These counties pay about $640 million each year to their pension funds. These adjustments would increase this annual payment to $1.4 billion – from 29% of payroll to 63%. To put this in perspective, payments to pension funds and pension bonds today consume about half of these counties' independent property tax income.   These adjustments show they should consume ALL county property tax income."    And in that WSJ piece by Robbie Whelan and Craig Karmin I quoted above:   CalPERS Downsizes Housing Portfolio CalPERS, the giant California pension fund, is dumping one of its last major housing investments at a big loss. In a major step toward winding down a two-decade program as the pension world's biggest player in the U.S. housing market, CalPERS is selling a portfolio of 28 housing communities to a partnership between San Diego-based developer Newland Real Estate Group LLC and an affiliate of Japan's largest home-building company, Sekisui House Ltd. The portfolio, which includes 16,300 unbuilt home sites and thousands of acres of additional undeveloped land in 11 states, represents about one-fifth of CalPERS' residential land portfolio. People familiar with the terms said the portfolio sold for between $500 million and $600 million. At that price range, the deal values each home site at about $35,000, at most. During the housing boom, big builders would typically buy the land underneath new homes for $75,000 to $150,000, depending on location and state of infrastructure completion. This means that CalPERS, which bought the property over about five years starting in 2002, is likely suffering a loss of as much as 30% to 50%, the people said. CalPERS move comes after three years of distressed-land sales by other major owners, including builders and banks that have driven down values by as much as 75% in some markets. CalPERS has resisted a major liquidation of its holdings until recently. During the past decade, CalPERS was the biggest U.S. public pension fund investing in residential housing and land deals, in certain deals using debt to finance up to 80% of the purchases. That boosted returns, but also risks.   Currently CalPERS has about 9% of its $226 billion in assets invested in real estate. Up until the crash, the pension fund used the proceeds from its housing investments to make payments to over 1.5 million state retirees.[..] After the bubble burst, CalPERS began suffering losses on a number of deals—losing more than $900 million on one deal alone. Last year, the pension giant started overhauling its real-estate-investment program and since then, it has put in place a plan to sell down its portfolio and concentrate on safer, income-producing commercial property. CalPERS officials think they are moving in the right direction. While the real-estate portfolio lost nearly half its value, or about $10 billion from March 2008 to June 2009, CalPERS says, it has rebounded more recently. For the 12 months through September, the most recent numbers available, the real estate portfolio returned 14%, according to CalPERS. That return last year beat the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, which fell 1.3% through September. But CalPERS real estate portfolio return for the three year period ending in June wasn't as pretty: it lost 24%, according to Wilshire Consulting.   So there it is for now. And as I said, I don’t get it. CalPERS assets hit a high in October 2007 of $261 billion. Their value fell to $164.7 billion in 2009. Since then, if we follow the WSJ news report, the portfolio gained $91.3 billion, not far below 20% per year. Even as fiscal year 2011 return was just 1%. Moody's says CalPERS should lower its assumed rate of return to 5.5%, because it can't achieve the 7.5% the fund itself estimates it will make. It's today selling real estate holdings that have fallen from 30%-75% in value. I get that CalPERS tries to hide losses through unrealistically high return assumptions, nothing new there. But these numbers are something else altogether. And I don't get it. Do you?
Flickr/kplawverThe Chinese economy is "very credit dependent", warn GMO analysts Edward Chancellor and Mike Monnelly.  Not long ago, cities like Wenzhou would see bad debts surge, and small business owners and property developers would default in droves throwing a spanner in the great Chinese economic growth story. Credit cooled off, but only temporarily. With the economy beginning to recover and property prices picking, credit growth is accelerating once again.  But Chancellor and Monnelly argue that there are still at least 10 indicators of "acute financial fragility" in China's credit system. Here they are verbatim: "Not only does financial fragility look to be on the rise, Beijing seems to be on the verge of losing control over the credit system," they write.
westvillagebob / FlickrYesterday, we published a presentation by oil analyst Arthur Berman suggesting the potential of fracking to extract fossil fuels buried in shale rock has been way overhyped. But there are many who would argue that the assumptions Berman makes are off the mark. Using data from the Energy Information Administration and Canadian energy consultancy ITG, we have put together the counter-argument to Berman's thesis.
The idea that innovation and new technology have stopped driving growth is getting increasing attention. But it is not well founded BOOM times are back in Silicon Valley. Office parks along Highway 101 are once again adorned with the insignia of hopeful start-ups. Rents are soaring, as is the demand for fancy vacation homes in resort towns like Lake Tahoe, a sign of fortunes being amassed. The Bay Area was the birthplace of the semiconductor industry and the computer and internet companies that have grown up in its wake. Its wizards provided many of the marvels that make the world feel futuristic, from touch-screen phones to the instantaneous searching of great libraries to the power to pilot a drone thousands of miles away. The revival in its business activity since 2010 suggests progress is motoring on. So it may come as a surprise that some in Silicon Valley think the place is stagnant, and that the rate of innovation has been slackening for decades. Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, an internet payment company, and the first outside investor in Facebook, a social network, says that innovation in America is "somewhere between dire straits and dead". Engineers in all sorts of areas share similar feelings of disappointment. And a small but growing group of economists reckon the economic impact of the innovations of today may pale in comparison with those of the past. Some suspect that the rich worldâ€™s economic doldrums may be rooted in a long-term technological stasis. In a 2011 e-book Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, argued that the financial crisis was masking a deeper and more disturbing "Great Stagnation". It was this which explained why growth in rich-world real incomes and employment had long been slowing and, since 2000, had hardly risen at all (see chart 1). The various motors of 20th-century growth--some technological, some not--had played themselves out, and new technologies were not going to have the same invigorating effect on the economies of the future. For all its flat-screen dazzle and high-bandwidth pizzazz, it seemed the world had run out of ideas. The EconomistThe argument that the world is on a technological plateau runs along three lines. The first comes from growth statistics. Economists divide growth into two different types, "extensive" and "intensive". Extensive growth is a matter of adding more and/or better labour, capital and resources. These are the sort of gains that countries saw from adding women to the labour force in greater numbers and increasing workersâ€™ education. And, as Mr Cowen notes, this sort of growth is subject to diminishing returns: the first addition will be used where it can do most good, the tenth where it can do the tenth-most good, and so on. If this were the only sort of growth there was, it would end up leaving incomes just above the subsistence level. Intensive growth is powered by the discovery of ever better ways to use workers and resources. This is the sort of growth that allows continuous improvement in incomes and welfare, and enables an economy to grow even as its population decreases. Economists label the all-purpose improvement factor responsible for such growth "technology"--though it includes things like better laws and regulations as well as technical advance--and measure it using a technique called "growth accounting". In this accounting, "technology" is the bit left over after calculating the effect on GDP of things like labour, capital and education. And at the moment, in the rich world, it looks like there is less of it about. Emerging markets still manage fast growth, and should be able to do so for some time, because they are catching up with technologies already used elsewhere. The rich world has no such engine to pull it along, and it shows. The EconomistThis is hardly unusual. For most of human history, growth in output and overall economic welfare has been slow and halting. Over the past two centuries, first in Britain, Europe and America, then elsewhere, it took off. In the 19th century growth in output per person--a useful general measure of an economyâ€™s productivity, and a good guide to growth in incomes--accelerated steadily in Britain. By 1906 it was more than 1% a year. By the middle of the 20th century, real output per person in America was growing at a scorching 2.5% a year, a pace at which productivity and incomes double once a generation (see chart 2). More than a century of increasingly powerful and sophisticated machines were obviously a part of that story, as was the rising amount of fossil-fuel energy available to drive them. But in the 1970s Americaâ€™s growth in real output per person dropped from its post-second-world-war peak of over 3% a year to just over 2% a year. In the 2000s it tumbled below 1%. Output per worker per hour shows a similar pattern, according to Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University: it is pretty good for most of the 20th century, then slumps in the 1970s. It bounced back between 1996 and 2004, but since 2004 the annual rate has fallen to 1.33%, which is as low as it was from 1972 to 1996. Mr Gordon muses that the past two centuries of economic growth might actually amount to just "one big wave" of dramatic change rather than a new era of uninterrupted progress, and that the world is returning to a regime in which growth is mostly of the extensive sort (see chart 3). The Economist Mr Gordon sees it as possible that there were only a few truly fundamental innovations--the ability to use power on a large scale, to keep houses comfortable regardless of outside temperature, to get from any A to any B, to talk to anyone you need to--and that they have mostly been made. There will be more innovation--but it will not change the way the world works in the way electricity, internal-combustion engines, plumbing, petrochemicals and the telephone have. Mr Cowen is more willing to imagine big technological gains ahead, but he thinks there are no more low-hanging fruit. Turning terabytes of genomic knowledge into medical benefit is a lot harder than discovering and mass producing antibiotics. The pessimistsâ€™ second line of argument is based on how much invention is going on. Amid unconvincing appeals to the number of patents filed and databases of "innovations" put together quite subjectively, Mr Cowen cites interesting work by Charles Jones, an economist at Stanford University. In a 2002 paper Mr Jones studied the contribution of different factors to growth in American per-capita incomes in the period 1950-93. His work indicated that some 80% of income growth was due to rising educational attainment and greater "research intensity" (the share of the workforce labouring in idea-generating industries). Because neither factor can continue growing ceaselessly, in the absence of some new factor coming into play growth is likely to slow. The growth in the number of people working in research and development might seem to contradict this picture of a less inventive economy: the share of the American economy given over to R&amp;D has expanded by a third since 1975, to almost 3%. But Pierre Azoulay of MIT and Benjamin Jones of Northwestern University find that, though there are more people in research, they are doing less good. They reckon that in 1950 an average R&amp;D worker in America contributed almost seven times more to "total factor productivity"--essentially, the contribution of technology and innovation to growth--that an R&amp;D worker in 2000 did. One factor in this may be the "burden of knowledge": as ideas accumulate it takes ever longer for new thinkers to catch up with the frontier of their scientific or technical speciality. Mr Jones says that, from 1985 to 1997 alone, the typical "age at first innovation" rose by about one year. The third argument is the simplest: the evidence of your senses. The recent rate of progress seems slow compared with that of the early and mid-20th century. Take kitchens. In 1900 kitchens in even the poshest of households were primitive things. Perishables were kept cool in ice boxes, fed by blocks of ice delivered on horse-drawn wagons. Most households lacked electric lighting and running water. Fast forward to 1970 and middle-class kitchens in America and Europe feature gas and electric hobs and ovens, fridges, food processors, microwaves and dishwashers. Move forward another 40 years, though, and things scarcely change. The gizmos are more numerous and digital displays ubiquitous, but cooking is done much as it was by grandma. Or take speed. In the 19th century horses and sailboats were replaced by railways and steamships. Internal-combustion engines and jet turbines made it possible to move more and more things faster and faster. But since the 1970s humanity has been coasting. Highway travel is little faster than it was 50 years ago; indeed, endemic congestion has many cities now investing in trams and bicycle lanes. Supersonic passenger travel has been abandoned. So, for the past 40 years, has the moon. Medicine offers another example. Life expectancy at birth in America soared from 49 years at the turn of the 20th century to 74 years in 1980. Enormous technical advances have occurred since that time. Yet as of 2011 life expectancy rested at just 78.7 years. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on research, people continue to fall to cancer, heart disease, stroke and organ failure. Molecular medicine has come nowhere close to matching the effects of improved sanitation. To those fortunate enough to benefit from the best that the world has to offer, the fact that it offers no more can disappoint. As Mr Thiel and his colleagues at the Founders Fund, a venture-capital company, put it: "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters." A world where all can use Twitter but hardly any can commute by air is less impressive than the futures dreamed of in the past. The first thing to point out about this appeal to experience and expectation is that the science fiction of the mid-20th century, important as it may have been to people who became entrepreneurs or economists with a taste for the big picture, constituted neither serious technological forecasting nor a binding commitment. It was a celebration through extrapolation of then current progress in speed, power and distance. For cars read flying cars; for battlecruisers read space cruisers. Technological progress does not require all technologies to move forward in lock step, merely that some important technologies are always moving forward. Passenger aeroplanes have not improved much over the past 40 years in terms of their speed. Computers have sped up immeasurably. Unless you can show that planes matter more, to stress the stasis over the progress is simply a matter of taste. Mr Gordon and Mr Cowen do think that now-mature technologies such as air transport have mattered more, and play down the economic importance of recent innovations. If computers and the internet mattered to the economy--rather than merely as rich resources for intellectual and cultural exchange, as experienced on Mr Cowenâ€™s popular blog, Marginal Revolution--their effect would be seen in the figures. And it hasnâ€™t been. As early as 1987 Robert Solow, a growth theorist, had been asking why "you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics". A surge in productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s was seen as an encouraging sign that the computers were at last becoming visible; but it faltered, and some, such as Mr Gordon, reckon that the benefits of information technology have largely run their course. He notes that, for all its inhabitantsâ€™ Googling and Skypeing, Americaâ€™s productivity performance since 2004 has been worse than that of the doldrums from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. Closer analysis of recent figures, though, suggests reason for optimism. Across the economy as a whole productivity did slow in 2005 and 2006--but productivity growth in manufacturing fared better. The global financial crisis and its aftermath make more recent data hard to interpret. As for the strong productivity growth in the late 1990s, it may have been premature to see it as the effect of information technology making all sorts of sectors more productive. It now looks as though it was driven just by the industries actually making the computers, mobile phones and the like. The effects on the productivity of people and companies buying the new technology seem to have begun appearing in the 2000s, but may not yet have come into their own. Research by Susanto Basu of Boston College and John Fernald of the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggests that the lag between investments in information-and-communication technologies and improvements in productivity is between five and 15 years. The drop in productivity in 2004, on that reckoning, reflected a state of technology definitely pre-Google, and quite possibly pre-web. Full exploitation of a technology can take far longer than that. Innovation and technology, though talked of almost interchangeably, are not the same thing. Innovation is what people newly know how to do. Technology is what they are actually doing; and that is what matters to the economy. Steel boxes and diesel engines have been around since the 1900s, and their use together in containerised shipping goes back to the 1950s. But their great impact as the backbone of global trade did not come for decades after that. Roughly a century lapsed between the first commercial deployments of James Wattâ€™s steam engine and steamâ€™s peak contribution to British growth. Some four decades separated the critical innovations in electrical engineering of the 1880s and the broad influence of electrification on economic growth. Mr Gordon himself notes that the innovations of the late 19th century drove productivity growth until the early 1970s; it is rather uncharitable of him to assume that the post-2004 slump represents the full exhaustion of potential gains from information technology. The EconomistAnd information innovation is still in its infancy. Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer of computer science and a devotee of exponential technological extrapolation, likes to talk of "the second half of the chess board". There is an old fable in which a gullible king is tricked into paying an obligation in grains of rice, one on the first square of a chessboard, two on the second, four on the third, the payment doubling with every square. Along the first row, the obligation is minuscule. With half the chessboard covered, the king is out only about 100 tonnes of rice. But a square before reaching the end of the seventh row he has laid out 500m tonnes in total--the whole worldâ€™s annual rice production. He will have to put more or less the same amount again on the next square. And there will still be a row to go. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT make use of this image in their e-book "Race Against the Machine". By the measure known as Mooreâ€™s law, the ability to get calculations out of a piece of silicon doubles every 18 months. That growth rate will not last for ever; but other aspects of computation, such as the capacity of algorithms to handle data, are also growing exponentially. When such a capacity is low, that doubling does not matter. As soon as it matters at all, though, it can quickly start to matter a lot. On the second half of the chessboard not only has the cumulative effect of innovations become large, but each new iteration of innovation delivers a technological jolt as powerful as all previous rounds combined. As an example of this acceleration-of-effect they offer autonomous vehicles. In 2004 the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a branch of Americaâ€™s Department of Defence, set up a race for driverless cars that promised $1 million to the team whose vehicle finished the 240km (150-mile) route fastest. Not one of the robotic entrants completed the course. In August 2012 Google announced that its fleet of autonomous vehicles had completed some half a million kilometres of accident-free test runs. Several American states have passed or are weighing regulations for driverless cars; a robotic-transport revolution that seemed impossible ten years ago may be here in ten more. That only scratches the surface. Across the board, innovations fuelled by cheap processing power are taking off. Computers are beginning to understand natural language. People are controlling video games through body movement alone--a technology that may soon find application in much of the business world. Three-dimensional printing is capable of churning out an increasingly complex array of objects, and may soon move on to human tissues and other organic material. An innovation pessimist could dismiss this as "jam tomorrow". But the idea that technology-led growth must either continue unabated or steadily decline, rather than ebbing and flowing, is at odds with history. Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago points out that productivity growth during the age of electrification was lumpy. Growth was slow during a period of important electrical innovations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; then it surged. The information-age trajectory looks pretty similar (see chart 4). It may be that the 1970s-and-after slowdown in which the technological pessimists set such store can be understood in this way--as a pause, rather than a permanent inflection. The period from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s may simply represent one in which the contributions of earlier major innovations were exhausted while computing, biotechnology, personal communication and the rest of the technologies of today and tomorrow remained too small a part of the economy to influence overall growth. Other potential culprits loom, however--some of which, worryingly, might be permanent in their effects. Much of the economy is more heavily regulated than it was a century ago. Environmental protection has provided cleaner air and water, which improve peopleâ€™s lives. Indeed, to the extent that such gains are not captured in measurements of GDP, the slowdown in progress from the 1970s is overstated. But if that is so, it will probably continue to be so for future technological change. And poorly crafted regulations may unduly raise the cost of new research, discouraging further innovation. Another thing which may have changed permanently is the role of government. Technology pessimists rarely miss an opportunity to point to the Apollo programme, crowning glory of a time in which government did not simply facilitate new innovation but provided an ongoing demand for talent and invention. This it did most reliably through the military-industrial complex of which Apollo was a spectacular and peculiarly inspirational outgrowth. Mr Thiel is often critical of the venture-capital industry for its lack of interest in big, world-changing ideas. Yet this is mostly a response to market realities. Private investors rationally prefer modest business models with a reasonably short time to profit and cash out. A third factor which might have been at play in both the 1970s and the 2000s is energy. William Nordhaus of Yale University has found that the productivity slowdown which started in the 1970s radiated outwards from the most energy-intensive sectors, a product of the decadeâ€™s oil shocks. Dear energy may help explain the productivity slowdown of the 2000s as well. But this is a trend that one can hope to see reversed. In America, at least, new technologies are eating into those high prices. Mr Thiel is right to reserve some of his harshest criticism for the energy sectorâ€™s lacklustre record on innovation; but given the right market conditions it is not entirely hopeless. Perhaps the most radical answer to the problem of the 1970s slowdown is that it was due to globalisation. In a somewhat whimsical 1987 paper, Paul Romer, then at the University of Rochester, sketched the possibility that, with more workers available in developing countries, cutting labour costs in rich ones became less important. Investment in productivity was thus sidelined. The idea was heretical among macroeconomists, as it dispensed with much of the careful theoretical machinery then being used to analyse growth. But as Mr Romer noted, economic historians comparing 19th-century Britain with America commonly credit relative labour scarcity in America with driving forward the capital-intense and highly productive "American system" of manufacturing. Some economists are considering how Mr Romerâ€™s heresy might apply today. Daron Acemoglu, Gino Gancia, and Fabrizio Zilibotti of MIT, CREi (an economics-research centre in Barcelona) and the University of Zurich, have built a model to study this. It shows firms in rich countries shipping low-skill tasks abroad when offshoring costs little, thus driving apart the wages of skilled and unskilled workers at home. Over time, though, offshoring raises wages in less-skilled countries; that makes innovation at home more enticing. Workers are in greater demand, the income distribution narrows, and the economy comes to look more like the post-second-world-war period than the 1970s and their aftermath. Even if that model is mistaken, the rise of the emerging world is among the biggest reasons for optimism. The larger the size of the global market, the more the world benefits from a given new idea, since it can then be applied across more activities and more people. Raising Asiaâ€™s poor billions into the middle class will mean that millions of great minds that might otherwise have toiled at subsistence farming can instead join the modern economy and share the burden of knowledge with rich-world researchers--a sharing that information technology makes ever easier. It may still be the case that some parts of the economy are immune, or at least resistant, to some of the productivity improvement that information technology can offer. Sectors like health care, education and government, in which productivity has proved hard to increase, loom larger within the economy than in the past. The frequent absence of market pressure in such areas reduces the pressure for cost savings--and for innovation. For some, though, the opposite outcome is the one to worry about. Messrs Brynjolfsson and McAfee fear that the technological advances of the second half of the chessboard could be disturbingly rapid, leaving a scourge of technological unemployment in their wake. They argue that new technologies and the globalisation that they allow have already contributed to stagnant incomes and a decline in jobs that require moderate levels of skill. Further progress could threaten jobs higher up and lower down the skill spectrum that had, until now, seemed safe. Pattern-recognition software is increasingly good at performing the tasks of entry-level lawyers, scanning thousands of legal documents for relevant passages. Algorithms are used to write basic newspaper articles on sporting outcomes and financial reports. In time, they may move to analysis. Manual tasks are also vulnerable. In Japan, where labour to care for an ageing population is scarce, innovation in robotics is proceeding by leaps and bounds. The rising cost of looking after people across the rich world will only encourage further development. Such productivity advances should generate enormous welfare gains. Yet the adjustment period could be difficult. In the end, the main risk to advanced economies may not be that the pace of innovation is too slow, but that institutions have become too rigid to accommodate truly revolutionary changes--which could be a lot more likely than flying cars.

DesertBloomsWe recently took you on a tour of pre-gangbusters Macau. Today, we're going to visit Doha from back in the day.Â  With his permission, we've put together some amazing snapshots taken by a fellow who wished to by identified by his flickr name, DesertBlooms, who visited the Qatari capital in the '80s.Â  Â  Doha boasts the highest GDP per capita in the world â€” $98,000.Â  It wasn't always so.
Imagine that your financial advisor called you up one day and said: "Great news...your investment portfolio gained 1% in January which is an annualized return of 12%. Â However, we have to subtract .05% from that return because historically January's return has only been 0.95% since 1950. Â This brings our seasonally adjusted return to 11.4%." Â  Of course, after the SEC pays a visit to the advisor to correct his performance reporting measures, the simple reality is thatÂ "what you see is what you get." Â  While this example may seem a little farfetched - this is exactly what happens with a variety of economic reports that are released by various government agencies and member organization/lobby groups. Â The reasoning for such data manipulations is not a nefarious scheme; but rather an attempt to smooth what is normally very volatile data. Â This is particularly the case with housing related data. Â  As an example the chart below shows the data released by the Census Bureau for housing starts on both a non-seasonally and seasonally adjusted basis. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live As you can see there is an extreme amount of volatility in the non-seasonally adjusted data. Â The Census Bureau takes the reported monthly housing starts data and annualizes it. Â Therefore, if 10,000 homes were started in January it is reported as 120,000 on an annualized basis. Â Then a seasonal adjustment factor is added to account forÂ seasonal weather and demand patterns. Â  For example let's take a look at the housing start data that was just released for December of 2012. The headlines read thatÂ "Housing starts surged by 12.1% in December proving that the housing recovery is back."Â Â In reality the numbers were as follows: Historically, the data smoothing methodology wasÂ "close enough"Â  and the variations were, more or less, worked out over time. Â However, in the current economic environment, the seasonal adjustment process may be overstating that actual activity that is occurring within the underlying economy. Â With housing currently making a very small contribution to overall economic activity, just slightly more than 2.5% as shown in the chart below, the difference between theÂ "real"Â economic impact of 61,500 homes being started nationwide versus 954,000, of which 216,000 were a mathematical seasonal adjustment, can be quite dramatic.Â  Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live However, as in our financial advisor analogy, when it comes to the impact of theÂ "housing recovery"Â on the economyÂ "what we see is what we get"Â and nothing else. Â Therefore, in the quest to determine what the actual contribution to the overall economy that housing will provide, we need to look at the full process of housing on an actual basis. The Housing Process Activity Index (HAPI) The housing process begins with the permit to build a home which leads to the start of the construction process, the completion and the sell to an end buyer. Â  The reason for looking at all four components is that many permits that are filed do not result in a start, many starts do not lead to completions and there are many completions that remain unsold for quite some time. The Housing Process Activity Index (HAPI) takes into account all four variables. Â However, instead of utilizing seasonal adjustment factors and annualizing the monthly activity, as with the Census Bureau, I use a 12-month average of theÂ actualÂ monthly activity to smooth the data. Â The chart below shows the HAPI as compared to its individual HAPI subcomponents. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live This tells us quite a different story than what the media is currently reporting. Â  On average over the last twelve months there were: What this tells is that out of the 67,000 permits, on average, that were pulled each month to build a home only 30,900 actually wound up being completed and sold. Â This is a very different picture than the recent months seasonally adjusted data that showed: It is important to note thatÂ I am NOT contesting the manner in which the Census Bureau reports its housing data.Â Â I am, however, suggesting that the method used in the current economic environment may be overstating the actual activity that is occurring. Â By smoothing the non-seasonally adjusted data using a monthly average we see a very different perspective to the data. Â The HAPI begins to potentially answer the questions of why housing remains a low economic contributor and why construction employment is still mired at very low levels.Â  Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live While housing has improved somewhat from the post-crisis lows it is far weaker than the majority of headlines actually suggest. Â Housing inventory has declined sharply from its peaks that have primarily been driven by speculative all-cash investors turning lower priced homes, and buying homes in bulk from banks, to be turned into rentals. Â  Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live Furthermore, a large portion of theÂ "housing start"Â story has been in the multi-family apartment space. Â As shown in the chart below the percentage of apartment starts, 5-units or more, is currently at some of the highest levels on record and has surpassed the peak seen in the last recession. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live Currently, there are still more than 25% of homeowners underwater which limits their ability to move, refinance or sell their homes. Â However, as prices rise, there are two issues that begin to attack the housing story: Â 1) As prices reach levels where underwater homeowners can sell they will likely do so out of a psychology need to escape the "trap," which will bring a large supply of homes back onto the market, and; 2) rising prices will eventually erode the profitability of buying homes for rentals which will bring the speculative frenzy that has been the driver of the recent recovery to a halt. The housing recovery is ultimately a story of theÂ "real"Â unemployment situationÂ which still shows that roughly a quarter of the home buying cohort are unemployed and living at home with their parents. Â The remaining members of the home buying, household formation, contingent are employed but at lower ends of the pay scale and are choosing to rent due to budgetary considerations. Â Also, we should not discount the psychology of home ownership has dramatically changed since the crash as many of theÂ "millennials"Â saw the financial damage their parents suffered and are opting out of taking such a perceived risk. Â  AsÂ I stated recentlyÂ the optimism over the housing recovery has gotten well ahead of the underlying fundamentals. Â The overarching problem is that the housing market that is almost exclusively dependent on the continued push to artificially suppress interest rates combined with massive amounts of direct stimulus, and incentives, to bailout current homeowners and banks. Â This intervention is causing an artificial supply suppression which is likely to create a backlash in the future as the current supply/demand conditions are unsustainable. While the belief was that the Government, and Fed's, interventions would ignite the housing market creating an self-perpetuating recovery in the economy - it did not turn out that way. Â Today, these repeated intrusions are having a diminished rate of return and the risk now is that interest rates rise shutting potential homebuyers out of the market. Â It is likely that in 2013 housing will begin to stabilize at historically low levels and the economic contribution will remain fairly weak. Â The downside risk to that view is the impact of higher taxes, stagnant wage growth, re-defaults of the 6-million modifications and workouts, elevated defaults of underwater homeowners and a slowdown of speculative investment due to reduced profit margins. Â While many hopes have been pinned on the 2012 stimulus fueled, China investing, and supply deprived housing recovery asÂ "the"Â driver of economic growth in 2013 - the data suggest that may be quite a bit of wishful thinking.
YouTube via LadyAmaltheaUnicornEleven members of the Eurozone have finally agreed to adopt a financial transaction tax often referred to as a ‘Robin Hood tax’ first discussed in September 2011. The tax will apply at the rate of 0.1 percent on stock and bond transactions and 0.01 percent on derivative trades. The countries in question are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. According to Ed King, these countries comprise 90% of the Eurozone's GDP. According to the European Council, the purpose of the tax is “to ensure that the financial sector fairly and substantially contributes to the costs of the crisis and that it is taxed in a fair way vis-à-vis other sectors for the future, to disincentivise excessively risky activities by financial institutions, to complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises and to generate additional revenue for general budgets or specific policy purposes.” Oxfam estimates the tax will boost these government’s coffers by a combined €37 billion per year. Notably absent from this agreement is the U.K., as The Guardian’s Peter Hain observes. His op-ed “Why Labour should put the Robin Hood tax centre stage” lambastes the government for passing up an estimated £8 billion of annual revenue, which could be used to stimulate job creation. As the official release from the European Council notes, this is the first time that a group of member states have agreed to ‘enhanced cooperation’ in the area of taxation.

Months ago, the infamous Paul Tudor Jones 'Trader' documentary resurfaced, only to disappear back into the depths internet again. So if you missed it then, grab it now from dailymotion before it's too late — last time it was only up for about a day. All the drama stems from the fact that PTJ does not like this movie. He asked PBS to stop airing after it premiered in 1987. He also, according to Wall Street lore, purchased almost all of the copies of the movie on VHS. So this movie is rare. It's very, very rare. It's basically the white stag of Wall Street. Watch it below (also, you're welcome): Paul Tudor Jones by totalinvestor There's a lot of Awesome 80s Stuff in it as well... check it out here&gt;
CSXRail giant CSX announced Q4 earnings of $0.43 per share, which is higher than the $0.39 per share expected. Norfolk Southern also announced earnings better than expected.Â  Earnings came in at $1.30 per share.Â  Analysts were looking for $1.19 per share. Click Here For Updates &gt; Railroaders move a wide array of goods across the country including energy, lumber and automobiles.Â  As such, they are considered reliable bellwethers of the economy. From CSX: For the quarter, total revenue of $2.9 billion declined 2 percent. The company saw an increase in merchandise and intermodal shipments, but these gains were more than offset by declines in coal resulting from low natural gas prices, high coal inventory at utilities and lower global demand. As a result of the lower revenue, which was partially offset by strong efficiency gains, operating income declined 4 percent to $804 million and the operating ratio increased 60 basis points to 72.1 percent. A similar sentiment was shared by Norfolk Southern: While the fourth quarter reflected declines in coal shipments, we also saw steady intermodal volume gains coupled with improved volumes in our chemicals, auto, and housing sectors, Both stocks are higher in after-hours trading.

A tailor recently told us the biggest mistake men make when buying a suit.  "They don't do enough research," said McGregor Madden, a trained tailor who founded men's apparel businesses ProperSuit.com and Hall &amp; Madden. Madden said that not knowing all the options can result in paying too much for a suit that ends up looking cheap and wearing out quickly.  Men are often intimidated by "inept and pushy salesman" and buy the first thing that comes along, he said.  But it's important to do research to find the right suit.  "A business suit is an investment piece that will project the image you want to make in a professional setting," said Madden. "Go around and check out high-end, low-end and medium-end stores and try on a variety of suits." "Don't be intimated, its not until you feel quality that you will know quality," he said. "Knowing what's out there will help you to make a decision you're happy with." He also encouraged men to get their suits tailored by a professional.  "At the end of the day you are getting garment not made for you that will need extensive tailoring services to ensure a proper fit," said Madden. "Your tailor may be your best friend." DON'T MISS: How Tory Burch Became A Fashion Billionaire In Less Than A Decade &gt;

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Gary Shilling: Cash Is A Good Bet For The Conservative Investor (The Globe And Mail) "I think for a conservative investor right now, cash is not a bad option. There still is some inflation in the economies of the world â€“ but not much. So cash is not eroding due to inflation the way it was way back in the 1970s. But when you really look at investmentsâ€¦we are going through this de-leveraging - in other words, working down the excess debt that was driven up by financial institutions of the world... while thatâ€™s going on I think we are going to have very slow growth in the economy. "Certainly, for equity markets, things have gotten very frothy, people are not paying attention to fundamentals and the slow growth in the world. But I think they will be forced to. With this in mind and the likelihood that we got another five years of this de-leveraging to go â€¦ I think cash is not a bad place to be for the foreseeable future for the conservative investor. "The fact is, the S&amp;P 500 is actually down from its peak in 2000. From 12 years ago, it is actually down 4 per cent. If anybody at the onset of 2000 had said, youâ€™re going to lose money over the next 12 years, would that person want to go into stocks? I donâ€™t think so. Why take a tremendous risk if youâ€™re going no where and I think thatâ€™s the condition we continue to be in. The downside risk is much greater than the upside potential." Oppenheimer Ordered To Pay Client $1.2 Million (The Wall Street Journal) An arbitration panel ordered Oppenheimer to pay Texas investor Lloyd A. Gillespie $1.2 million after he accused two of its brokers of "excessive trading in his account to generate hefty commissions".Â  Oppenheimer was found liable for about $848,000 in compensatory damages and interest, $174,000 in attorney's fees, and $52,000 in costs, but rejected claim on punitive damages. Meanwhile, the brokers' request to wipe these allegations from their record were also rejected.  Why Dylan Grice Is Bearish In 2013 (Advisor Perspectives) Dylan Grice said questions about trust are "fundamentally embedded" in the markets and that trust "moves the economy". And it is this feature of moneyÂ  that makes inflation such a threat. â€œYou cannot have this trust if you do not have money that you can trust,â€ Grice said. â€œWhen you devalue money, you devalue trust.â€ "This outlook â€“ trust is breaking down, the past seems to be repeating itself â€“ is why Grice said his investment outlook is very conservative for 2013. "Financial markets donâ€™t exist in a vacuum,â€ Grice said. â€œThat breakdown in trust, the financial market analog of that is higher yields. If you donâ€™t trust someone, what do you do? You want a high risk premium. You want higher interest rates.â€ A Frustrating Trend In The Stock Market Continues To Break The Bears' Hearts (Business Insider) There is a growing divergence between earnings expectations and stock prices. "Since the end of the fourth quarter (December 31), analysts have also reduced earnings growth expectations for Q1 2013 (to 2.2% from 2.5%) and Q2 2013 (to 6.7% from 6.8%)," according to John Butters at FactSet. FactSet The S&amp;P 500 Is Heading To 1,665 (Dr. Ed's Blog)  Ed Yardeni says his year-end S&amp;P 500 target continues to be 1,665, which would put the index up 16.7 percent in 2013.Â  "The bullâ€™s stamina has been based on performance-enhancing earnings. The forward earnings of the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 400, and S&amp;P 600 all rose to fresh record highs during the week of January 17, and are up 80.7%, 85.8%, and 102.7%, respectively, since the week of May 7, 2009. Actual revenues and operating earnings stopped growing on a y/y basis during Q3-2012. However, Iâ€™m expecting that better global economic growth will boost both of them this year." New Poll Shows How Crazy Bullish Investors Are Getting (Bloomberg) Bloomberg's Rich Miller and Simon Kennedy report that international investors are the most optimistic on stocks than they have been in the past 3.5 years. 53 percent said they are bullish on stocks.Â  Of those polled only 53 percent said the U.S. economy is improving but 38 percent believe that it offers the best opportunities compared with other major global economies.
In his latest research note, Nomura Chief Economist Richard Koo â€“ who pioneered the concept of "balance-sheet recession" â€“ says he feels the need to respond to those who are saying that the age of private-sector deleveraging in the U.S. is over. According to Koo, that assertion stems from an incorrect read of the Federal Reserve's latest Flow of Funds report, released in early December. The report showed that for the first time since 2007, the financial surplus of the U.S. household sector turned negative. In other words, the value of financial liabilities â€“ or debt â€“ was larger than that of financial assets in the household sector, meaning the net savings of households turned negative. The graph below shows this shift. The white bars are assets â€“ notice how they have exceeded the red bars (liabilities) since 2007 as households paid down debt in the wake of the collapse of the credit bubble. The blue line shows the difference between the two (assets minus liabilities). Nomura The shift to negative net savings in the household sector is supposed to be bullish for the U.S. economy. The implication is that at the end of 2012, households finally started borrowing again â€“Â spendingÂ again â€“ as opposed to paying off past debts. Koo, however, suggests that observers are missing the details, which paint a much bleaker picture. In fact, according to Koo, the wayÂ in which the household sector shifted to net negative savings at the end of 2012 has only been observed twice before in recent memory. The first time was following the collapse of the internet bubble in 2000, and the second time was following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Koo writes: Financial deficit due to drawdown of financial assets  We then have to ask why the broader household sector ran a financial deficit in Q3. The answer can also be found in Figure 1: the fact that the latest white bar is below zero means households drew down financial assets in the quarter.  And that is hardly a good sign. It has happened only three times since 2000, including the present occasion.  The first instance (barely visible in the graph) was in 2000 Q4, when the Internet bubble collapsed. The second was in 2008 Q4, when the failure of Lehman Brothers sparked a global financial crisis. People faced cash flow problems in both periods and probably were forced to draw down existing savings to make necessary payments.  Consumption driven by asset drawdowns not sustainable  During the bubble period towards the middle of Figure 1, much attention was paid to the fact that the US household savings rate had turned negative. While the sector did run a financial deficit during this period, the deficit was attributable to the fact that the increase in financial liabilities (ie growth in borrowing) was greater than the increase in financial assets (ie growth in savings). There was no drawdown of financial assets. Hence we need to pay attention to the fact that the latest figure shows only the third drawdown of financial assets since 2000 and that this drawdown is responsible for the financial deficit in the broader household sector. The reason: if household consumption is being financed by the drawdown of financial assets, it is not likely to be sustainable. This pattern of drawing down financial assets while reducing financial liabilities has been frequently observed in Greece during the last two years and is definitely not a positive development, in my view.Â  Meanwhile, Koo notes that the corporate sector in the United States remains a net saver, per the latest Flow of Funds report: Nomura So, what is the outlook for corporate sector releveraging, then? Koo writes that it's unlikely to return for several more years: Even in the aftermath of the Internet bubble collapse, during which the necessary adjustments were far milder, it took 12 quartersâ€”three full yearsâ€”for corporate sector behavior to return to pre-bubble norms.  Given that the shock of the housing bubble collapse was several times greater, I suspect that at least several more years will be needed before US companies stop increasing savings and resume borrowing money to expand operations. And with both the corporate and household sectors refusing to borrow, Koo writes that "fiscal stimulus is currently the only thing preventing the US economy from falling into a deflationary spiral, since both households and businesses are increasing savings in spite of zero interest rates." Bottom line: Koo thinks the releveraging argument is "premature," to say the least.
Last week 1600 people were laid off at Morgan Stanley in the first wave of 2013 cuts. This isn't too surprising as bank analysts all over the Street, including Meredith Whitney, have been saying the blood letting was not over since last fall. From eFinancialCareers: Barclays may begin handing out pink slips this week to some U.S. staffers in its investment banking division in an accelerated fashion meant to avoid the drawn-out process that characterized past job cutting, a person close to the situation said. Last year, people earmarked to be laid off first went through performance reviews, then were told they would get no bonuses and were ultimately let go, said one source at the bank. It was a month-long process, said the employee. This year, the layoffs in the U.S. will happen before performance reviews and bonus discussions. The employee said the accelerated cuts will likely happen globally. Good luck everyone.
Bloomberg via YouTubeOne of the big unresolved issues of the fiscal cliff is the sequester, or the massive spending programs that were supposed to expire automatically at the end of the 2012. America's defense contractors are expected to get hit the worst by sequestration.  And the indirect impacts are expected to ripple unfavorably through much of the economy. But in a note to clients today, Deutsche Bank's David Bianco writes that "some sequestration is good for stocks." From his note: We expect S&amp;P to continue to rally during 4Q reporting. After that investors will turn their attention to the US debt ceiling and sequestration. We believe debt ceiling will be raised. As we argue in our note, contrary to most views, we believe significant sequestration is good for stocks and see the main threat to the rally as being the failure to put through any spending cuts in 2013. Basically, Bianco thinks that the right kind of cuts would be favorable to U.S. debt metrics and in turn instill some confidence.  Here's more on Bianco's thoughts from a note he published on Thursday Fine-tuning sequestration is the best case scenario: Likely S&amp;P 500 target 1600We see the upcoming deadlines as an opportunity to improve the deficit. Slowing longer-term spending is key to stabilizing debt/GDP, but material 2013 cuts are needed for credibility. Thus, we think the best negotiated outcome trims the $70b sequestration for 2013 to ~$50b but maintains $1.2t in cuts over 9 years. Adding timing flexibility and opening more of the budget to cuts would cushion GDP impact, but cuts to entitlements and defense must occur under any credible plan. Thus, we favor modified sequestration. Sequestration without modification: Likely S&amp;P 500 target 1575At this time, unmodified sequestration appears to be a very possible outcome. However, near-term support should still be strong at 1400 for the S&amp;P in this scenario and we reiterate our 1575 year-end target. This outcome would pressure defense and many health care stocks; however, we think this risk is largely priced into those industries and the broader market would rally on a healthier fiscal outlook. GDP must demonstrate its ability to absorb the shock and still expand in 2013, but we think this is likely and 1575 should be reached by year-end likely with a late 2H rally after a range-bound summer. Here's a breakdown of sequestration from Bianco's note: Deutsche Bank SEE ALSO: Wall Street: Here's What Stocks Will Do This Year &gt;
Jim KlingeDespite our best efforts to explain otherwise, some bears still believe California's housing rebound is a mirage. John Burns, a Southern California-based real estate guru, says anyone still holding onto such negative beliefs is mistaken. In his latest note emailed to clients, Burns picks apart the naysayers' arguments.  He summarizes them as: These arguments are "ludicrous," he says, and he goes on to explain why: Burns concludes: "What happens when demand is strong, supply is low and affordability is the best in decades? Listen to the naysayers and you will miss out on one of the greatest investment opportunities in your lifetime." SEE MORE: The True Story Of How California Came Back From The Brink &gt;

Stock prices are going up as earnings expectations are going down.  And earnings expectations are arguably the most important drivers of stocks.  In technical terms, strategists will call this multiples expansion.  In other words, valuations are rising as reflected by an increasing price-earnings ratio. And this divergence between stocks and earnings expectations has only gotten wider since we last wrote about it a month ago, "Since the end of the fourth quarter (December 31), analysts have also reduced earnings growth expectations for Q1 2013 (to 2.2% from 2.5%) and Q2 2013 (to 6.7% from 6.8%)," writes FactSet's John Butters.

twitter.comBusiness, government, and entertainment elites are meeting in Davos this week. And there are numerous geo-political risks to be wary of in 2013, according to the Eurasia Group. In a new report titled The Vulnerability of Elites: Geopolitical Risk in 2013, the Eurasia Group points out 5 such risks to political and financial elites. "The vulnerability of elites cuts across emerging markets and advanced economies, democracies and authoritarian states, public and private institutions, and a wide array of issues. This is the challenge: as their legitimacy gets called into question, political actors struggle to react to instability, crises and opportunities in the most effective manner."

David Tepper, the founder of hedge fund Appaloosa Management, let his hair completely down in an interview with Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle this morning. It was so revealing that we even found out that Tepper won 'Best Actor' in high school. Ruhle, being an enterprising journalist, wanted to see why. Tepper played father Harry MacAfee in the classic musical 'Bye Bye Birdie', but to showcase his talent, he sang some of Conrad Birdie's part. He didn't do a bad job either. Check out how delighted Stephanie Ruhle is about 0:56 into the video. Check it out below (from Bloomberg):
If nominated and confirmed, she would be the first former prosecutor to head the organization. Ms. White already has an impressive â€˜firstâ€™ in her career â€“ she was the first woman to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, a position she held from 1993 to 2002. A 2001 CNN profile celebrates Whiteâ€™s career handling â€œcases that include Wall Street crime, international art theft, organized crime racketeering, drug trafficking, police corruption and terrorism.â€ Some career highlights include overseeing the prosecution of John Gotti and investigating the last-day pardon given to Marc Rich by President Clinton. But White also has experience on the other side of the aisle, offering her legal services to top bankers while serving as chair of the litigation department for Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, a prominent NYC law firm. Sheâ€™s defended former Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis against securities fraud, and helped Morgan Stanley's former CEO John Mack in 2005. This paragraph from her Debevoise &amp; Plimpton bio may discourage consumer protection advocates who expect White to be tough on bankers â€“ lately, sheâ€™s spent her days defending accused white-collar criminals: Ms. Whiteâ€™s practice concentrates on internal investigations and defense of companies and individuals accused by the government of involvement in white collar corporate crime or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and civil securities law violations, and on other major business litigation disputes and crises. Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, refers to White as â€œa blank slate,â€ intimating that little is known about her views on Dodd-Frank or the agency at large.
Ben Powless / FlickrNebraska Governor Dave Heineman just approved a new route for the Keystone XL Pipeline — the controversial pipeline that would allow crude oil products to flow down from Alberta's vast oil sands into the U.S. and ultimately the Gulf. Fox News reports. But the announcement tells us very little about whether the project will ultimately get approved. The State Department actually has final say on whether they like the new route submitted by Heineman, according to the memorandum of understanding signed between Foggy Bottom and Nebraska's Department of Environmental Quality.  If State approves the new route, they will make a recommendation to the White House. That's where the ultimate authority lies. State's recommendation will also include environmental and national economic considerations that are beyond the scope of the pipeline's transit through Nebraska. But if the President still sees something he doesn't like, the project could be a no-go. The State Department says it has no timetable for submitting their recommendation to the White House.

APClub for Growth, a conservatives grassroots organization feared by most Republicans, has given the GOP the green light to vote for the House debt ceiling bill Wednesday.Â  In a statement issued Tuesday, Club for Growth said that it would not make the the debt ceiling vote one of the "Key Votes" on its annual congressional scorecard, effectively giving Republicans a free pass to increase the country's borrowing limit.Â  â€œThe Club for Growth will not oppose tomorrowâ€™s vote on the debt ceiling,â€ Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said in the statement. â€œThe Club for Growth will, on the other hand, strongly oppose any efforts during the upcoming debate over the continuing resolution and sequester that fail to arrest out-of-control spending and put sensible limits on the growth of government.â€Â  That's a major reversal for an organization whose primary mission is to force lawmakers to curb government spending.Â  Until now, Club for Growth hasÂ demandedÂ that any vote to increase the debt limit include a balanced budget amendment.Â The last time Republicans tried to raise the debt ceiling, during the August 2011 budget battles, Club for Growth came out strongly against the deal, even though it included $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending cuts.Â  The group's statement today is the latest sign that even the staunchest conservatives are rapidly giving up on the debt ceiling fight. Earlier today, RedState editor Erick Erickson also gave Republicans a pass on the debt ceiling, calling on the party to regroup for battles over the budget and sequestration. This mass retreat paves a clear path for House Republicans to easily pass tomorrow's debt ceiling bill. That legislation basically suspends the debt ceiling limit for four months, with the expectation that the Senate will pass a budget in that time.Â  On Wednesday, the White House signaled that President Barack Obama would sign the Republican debt ceiling bill, should it pass the Senate. "He will not stand in the way," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. "We support the extension of the debt ceiling without drama or delay."

Wikimedia CommonsThe big story in the market right now is the incredible outbreak of bullishness. It's not just an attitude towards stocks, but a general view that a corner has been turned in terms of the economy and the long-lasting economic crisis. Earlier today we brought you a sentence form SocGen's Kit Juckes that explains a lot about why nobody's bearish: The reality is that we are short of things to worry about and long of liquidity which tends to weaken the resolve of any bear. We're seeing this all over the place. -- David Tepper said you have to be long stocks, because he just can't think of anything to be worried about. -- A new Bloomberg investor poll showed a huge breakout in bullishness. -- A SocGen economist talked about how America's "watershed" moment was near. -- Mohamed El-Erian hinted that the "New Normal" might be over, and that it might be a return to the "old normal." -- A BofA poll found that professional fund managers were getting bullish in record levels. The economy is still weak. Unemployment is too high and growth is meh. But with the GOP caving on the debt ceiling, Europe reducing its tail risk, and China growing, people are just having a really hard time being anything other than bullish.
Henry Blodget, Business InsiderThe folks who run the excellent DLD conference in Munich were kind enough to ask me to speak again this year. And they took great care of me.

So far, excluding financials, the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q4 earnings below analysts' estimates outnumber the ones that have beat them. However, the tally for revenue is a bit more upbeat, which suggests demand is stronger than expected. 39% of firms beat consensus sales expectations by more than one standard deviation, which is slightly higher than the historical average of 38%, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs While the number of companies' missing estimates is less than average, the number that missed sales estimates by at least one standard deviation is slightly higher than usual at 22% versus the 18% average, according to the report.  Goldman Sachs "This is an improvement versus the last two quarters when half as many firms beat sales expectations while twice as many missed," write the analysts at Goldman. Still, it's far too early in the earnings season to jump to any conclusions.

In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley research introduced a new model designed to identity stocks that will receive a tender offer â€“ a takeover bid â€“ over the next 12 months. The model is called ALERT, which stands for the Acquisition Likelihood Estimate Ranking Tool. The team believes high corporate cash balances and recent offer activity, which is at a cyclical low (see chart below) leave the market â€œpoised for a rebound in activity.â€ Morgan StanleyThe ALERT model uses 10 indicators, including debt-to-asset ratio, dividend yield, and relative price-to-book, to identify potential offer recipients. Of the 40 stocks in the top quintile of ALERT, 9 stocks received an 'overweight' rating from Morgan Stanley analysts: The research team throws caution to the winds, reminding clients that only 2.8% of the largest 1000 companies receive an offer over the course of the year. The stocks that do receive an offer, however, tend to appreciate handsomely. According to Morgan Stanleyâ€™s team, â€œStocks that receive an offer in the subsequent quarter produce an average relative return of over 21 percent from the end of the quarter through the day of the offer.â€

Legendary hedge fund manager David Tepper is on Bloomber TV with Stephanie Ruhle today talking global macro (he's an optimist) and everything else under the sun. At the same time, he managed to get in a deep dig on one of Wall Street's most famous feuds, the buy-side (hedge funds, private equity etc.) vs. the sell side (bulge bracket banks). Tepper used to work at Goldman Sachs, but said he'd never go back: "I'd rather work at McDonald's than the sell-side," he said. Burn. Get the full interview here&gt;
Bloomberg TV screengrabDavid Tepper, who runs $12 billion distressed debt hedge fund Appaloosa Management, was on Bloomberg TV "Market Makers" with Stephanie Ruhle moments ago.   It was a tremendous interview and it showed a very relaxed and funny side of Tepper. Tepper, who has one of the best long-term track records, told Bloomberg TV that his fund was up 30% in 2012.   He's said he's "going to come out of the closet" as being bullish in 2013. The reason, he explained, is there are no major negatives and basically nothing to really be bearish about. "This country is on the verge of an explosion of greatness," he said, "An explosion of greatness." He said the "main thing right now is to be long equities."  He said that if you're long equities, you're going to make money this year. Tepper is long Citigroup, which is one of his fund's top holdings.  He thinks Citi has a 50% upside from here due to its international business. As an aside, he clearly had a lot of fun on set with Ruhle. At the beginning, Tepper, who owns a 5% stake in his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, gave her a Steelers hat.  Tepper joked that it might mess up her hair if she tried it on.  We're told Ruhle did try the hat on.     Speaking of jokes, Tepper was full of them today.  For example, he made fun of the Bloomberg TV set for being cheap when Ruhle said she didn't make a lot of money and he also said something about how taking his clothes off would kill Bloomberg TV's ratings.  He also took a jab at the sell-side.  Tepper, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, said he "would rather work at McDonald's than the sell-side." He later said he tried to get a job at McDonald's one time and they wouldn't hire him. Toward the end of the segment, Tepper broke into song sharing his musical abilities.  During his senior year of high school, Tepper played the father (Harry MacAfee) in the musical Bye, Bye Birdie and won the "best actor award."   Ruhle also asked him about his "biggest regret."  He responded saying he wished he used Rogaine earlier.  Bloomberg showed images of him earlier in the segment rocking an afro in 1978. 
According to his sources, Microsoft might invest $1-$3 billion with the group looking to take Dell private. Microsoft is talking to Silver Lake and Michael Dell, who are working on the deal. The Microsoft investment would be "mezzanine," or some sort of preferred shares, says Faber. Mezzanine is typically debt that converts to equity if the debt isn't paid back in certain period of time. Faber wasn't entirely clear on what he meant when he said it was in the form of "preferred" shares. Our guess is that the Microsoft loan could convert to preferred shares at a certain point. This makes sense since getting the money in place to take Dell private is probably one of the hardest parts of this deal. Microsoft, which is loaded with cash, could help out. Microsoft has been a very aggressive investor. It invested in Facebook. It invested in Barnes &amp; Noble. It invested in Comcast. It invested in Apple, when it was at death's door. Like any investor, Microsoft has a mixed track record. Investing in Dell would be very interesting for both companies. Part of Dell's downfall can be attributed to its reliance on the Windows-based PCs, which is a shrinking industry. As a private company, Faber notes that Dell wants to reinvent itself. If Microsoft is an investor, it's going to have influence over Dell's business. This could limit Dell's ability to seek out a new model. From Microsoft's perspective, it's another tangled conflict. It's investing in one of its PC partners. How will Acer, HP, Asus, et al feel about Microsoft picking a PC company to invest in? Here's the video of Faber: 
KKR recently published its outlook for the global economy and markets. Among other things, they assume that inflation will continue to be tame, despite fears that we're headed for high inflation or even hyperinflation. Henry McVey, KKR's Head of Global Macro &amp; Asset Allocation, believes Europe continues to have a lot of deleveraging to do, which should keep prices in check. From his outlook: Third, despite massive stimulus, we think that global inflation in the developed markets remains low in 2013. Given that central banks around the world continue to deploy unprecedented amounts of liquidity, we believe it is important to “fact check” our thesis that inflation will remain low in the near term. So, what are we thinking? Our view is that a synchronous increase in global inflation can only occur after bank deleveraging in Europe has been completed (Exhibit 17). Indeed, while U.S. banks and brokers have largely completed their deleveraging cycle, the reconfiguring of balance sheets has not fully run its course in Europe (Exhibit 16). Besides banks having no desire to mark down impaired credit because of the associated hit to equity, one of the major issues has been that recently announced ECB programs have encouraged the banks to actually add to, not subtract from their government bond holdings. Here are the charts: KKR KKR
Bloomberg TV's Erik Schatzker is among the hoards of journalists in Davos, Switzerland hobnobbing with the most important people in the world. And of course, even among the most important people in the world, there are those who are more important than others and ways to know who is who. According to Schatzker, those on the top of the pecking order have white badges with with a World Economic Forum hologram on them. Then come their spouses (white badges without the holograms)... and so the order goes until you get to journalists, technicians, and the like wearing purple and orange.

Blockbuster has announced that it's closing around 300 stores in the U.S. over the next few weeks.Â  That's around 35 percent of its total brick-and-mortar presence of 850 stores. Around 3,000 employees will be laid off as a result of the closings, according to a spokesperson from parent company Dish Network. "We continue to see value in the Blockbuster brand and we will continue to analyze store level profitability and â€” as we have in the past â€” close unprofitable stores," the spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times. Dish acquired Blockbuster back in a 2011 bankruptcy sale. At that point, the chain operated around 1,700 stores. The company had planned to leverage Blockbuster's brand name to push its streaming service to compete with Netflix and Redbox.

Several other major stock market indexes have gone vertical in recent days to new record highs including the S&amp;P 400 MidCaps (up 165.4% since March 9, 2009), S&amp;P 600 SmallCaps (175.1), S&amp;P 500 Transportation (161.3), and Russell 2000 (160.1). The bull may be getting old, but you have to respect the strength and breadth of its most recent charge. The bullâ€™s stamina has been based on performance-enhancing earnings. The forward earnings of the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 400, and S&amp;P 600 all rose to fresh record highs during the week of January 17, and are up 80.7%, 85.8%, and 102.7%, respectively, since the week of May 7, 2009. Actual revenues and operating earnings stopped growing on a y/y basis during Q3-2012. However, Iâ€™m expecting that better global economic growth will boost both of them this year. Stocks remain relatively cheap. Since the start of the bull market, valuations have been held down by fears of a double dip in the US, a hard landing in China, and a meltdown in Europe. If these concerns diminish this year, as I expect, there is room for higher multiples, especially for the S&amp;P 500 (selling at 13.1 times forward earnings on Friday) as well as the S&amp;P 400 (15.3) and the S&amp;P 600 (15.9).Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Performance-Enhanced Bull.Â  (1) Paying respects to Rodney Dangerfield.

David McNew/Getty ImagesExisting home sales unexpectedly fell 1 percent in December to a 4.94 million annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors. November's reading was revised down to a 4.99 million annual rate. But the report wasn't entirely negative, the national median existing-home price for all housing types was $180,800 in December, up 11.5 percent from a year ago. Existing home prices were up for ten straight months. For 2012, the preliminary reading of median existing home prices was $176,600, up 6.3 percent from 2011. A regional breakdown showed that existing home sales in Northeast were up 3.2 percent; in the Midwest they fell 5.9 percent; in the south they were down 3 percent and in the West they were up 5.1 percent. Millan Mulraine of TD Securities said numbers could have been impacted by fiscal cliff concerns but could pick up in January reading: "Overall, this report points to some modest relapse in what has otherwise been a steady rebound in housing market activity since the summer months, and the drop in sales may have been due in part to the impact of elevated concerns at the time about the impact of the fiscal cliff.Â  Given this, we anticipate that sales activity could rebound in January following the tax deal, given the very supportive buying conditions and the increasing incentive for first-time buyers (who are currently sitting on the fence) to slowing move into the market as prices begin to firm." Original Existing home sales for December will be out at 10 a.m. ET. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for a rise in existing home sales to a 5.1 million annual rate.Â  Click here to refresh &gt; In November, existing home sales were up 14.5 percent year-over-year, and up 5.9 percent on the month.Â  The National Association of Realtors (NAR) measure of resales includes previously constructed homes, condominium, and co-ops in which a sale closed during the month.Â  Existing home sales account for a larger share of the market than new homes, according to Bloomberg. Existing home sales and new home sales both began to pick up in 2012 but the latter increased at a slower pace. That coupled with the recent uptick in housing starts and homebuilder confidence is raising concerns about a build up in inventory that could impact the housing recovery.

Economists expected the index to remain unchanged. The sub-components of the survey indicated weakness across the board, but the most stunning drop was in the volume of new orders, which fell from to an index reading of -17 from +10 in December. Below is a summary from the text of the release: Manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region declined in January following two months of modest expansion, according to the Richmond Fed's latest survey. Nearly all broad indicators of activity fell into negative territory. Other indicators also suggested additional softness. Capacity utilization turned negative as did the gauge for delivery times, while backlogs continued its downward trend. In addition, finished goods inventories grew at a slightly quicker pace. Looking ahead, assessments of business prospects for the next six months were somewhat more optimistic in January. An increasing number of contacts anticipated faster growth for new orders, capacity utilization, vendor lead-time, average workweek and capital expenditures, pushing up those indicators. Survey assessments of current prices indicated that raw materials prices grew at a slightly quicker pace than in December, while finished goods prices grew at a slightly slower rate.

In a statement released late Friday, the People's Bank of China said it would immediately begin using new short-term measures to inject or withdraw cash from the banking system as needed. The measures would be conducted with 12 major commercial members and would supplement its current twice-a-week open market operations when liquidity in the banking system suffers "temporary fluctuation," it said.China Premier-Designate Pushes for Disclosure of Pollution Index: Media-Caijing - This was the first time for a member of the ruling Party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee has addressed the pollution levelsCaterpillar Unit in Scandal Has Unusual Roots - WSJ.com- The company had been a relic of China's planned economy, but a U.S.-trained mining engineer and coal tycoon, Li Rubo, and Emory Williams, a Beijing-based American entrepreneur, transformed it over the past decade, seeking to tap growing demand for industrial equipment. They got it publicly listed as a non-Chinese company, with prominent international shareholders. The company obtained its Hong Kong listing in 2010, using a maneuver called a reverse takeover, according to ERA Mining's regulatory filings.

While no one would expect China to field ships at the same pace the US did in WWII, even if China adds orders of a single large PLAN vessel or multiple smaller vessels for 30 shipyards over 5 years while sustaining current construction pace for PLA Navy and government maritime agencies, the size of the PLAN and associated government maritime agencies could potentially triple by 2020.U.S., China in deal on U.N.

SAC Capital lost yet another massive influx of cash, the Wall Street Journal reports. This time, from Japanese bank Mizuho Financial Group. Since the beginning of 2013, the most profitable hedge fund in the world, has been girding its loins for a mass exodus of capital. Investors are running from the scrutiny of an intense SEC investigation into the firm's operations, as last November, federal prosecutors wrote that SAC CEO Steve Cohen interacted with alleged insider trader, Mathew Martoma in their complaint. Cohen was mentioned in the complaint as 'Portfolio Manager A,' and you don't want to be Portfolio Manager A. The exodus of cash has already been public and brutal. Clients can pull 25% of their investments out of the fund every quarter, but they have to give the firm 45 days notice. The next deadline for notifying SAC is February 15th, and a bunch of firms have already announced that they're clearing out. Here's a list of some redemptions made public so far: SAC has said it expects to see $1 billion worth of redemptions (17% of its total outside investment capital). Meanwhile, investors aside, there have been a bunch of other signs that things are going south for SAC. The fund is closing its Chicago office and pumping up bonuses for portfolio managers by 3% to stop them from leaving the firm. In Court, former SAC analyst Wesley Wang walked away from his insider trading guilty plea with a slap on the wrist (2 years probation without a fine) after wearing a wire and naming as many as 20 names connected to insider trading schemes, according to federal prosecutors. In short: Things are just not looking good.
">Harold Cunningham / Getty ImagesAS THE movers and shakers head to the Swiss mountain resort of Davos this week for the annual World Economic Forum, their credentials as global leaders look anything but resilient. Their official theme will be â€œresilient dynamismâ€, whatever that means, but what they ought to be talking about is the low level of trust the public has in their ability to do anything useful. The annual "Trust Barometer" survey published by Edelman, a public-relations firm, reports widespread scepticism about the ethics practised by political and business leaders. The lowest scores were when those surveyed were asked if they trust leaders to â€œtell the truth, regardless of how complex or unpopular it isâ€: only 18% trusted business leaders, whilst government leaders scored a yet more miserable 13%. This lack of trust seems strikingly personal. As Edelman points out, trust in business and government leaders is far lower than trust in the respective institutions of business and government. Globally there is a gap of 32 percentage points between trust in business and trust in business leaders to tell the truth (35% in America and China), and a 28 percentage-point gap between trust in government and trust in its leaders to tell the truth (47% in China, 35% in India). Whilst trust in leaders remains horribly low, overall trust in institutions has actually edged up in the past yearsâ€”though hardly to levels at which anyone should feel satisfied. Overall trust across business, government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media is now 57%, up from 51% in 2012, according to Edelmanâ€™s barometer, which as in previous years is based on a poll in 26 countries of what Edelman calls â€œinformed peopleâ€, which typically means professional and well-educated. A companion survey found significantly lower levels of trust among the population at large: 48%, nine percentage points less globally, 14 points less in America, Poland and Sweden. Institutions in only 11 of the countries enjoyed trust levels of at least 50% among their general public, whilst 18 did among informed people.Â  Trust has risen evenly over all four sorts of institution. NGOs remain the most trusted, at 63%, and government least trusted, at 48%. In only eight countries is government trusted more than business, which is not saying much in low trust South Korea (government 44%, business 31%) and hard to believe in seemingly high trust China (81% and 74%). For government, the reasons cited for a lack of trust included corruption or fraud (33%) followed by poor performance (31%). Only 16% cited poor performance as a cause of low trust in business, whose top negatives were corruption or fraud (27%) and wrong incentives driving business decisions (23%). Executive pay retains the power to annoy: the only countries in which NGOs are trusted by less than 50% of those surveyed are Sweden (46%), Russia (40%) and Japan (37%). As in 2012, technology is the most trusted industry, with 77% approval, eight percentage points ahead of the car industry. Even banks and financial services now enjoy a 50% trust score worldwide, up from 47% and 45% respectively in 2012. However, there are significant differences between countries on the banks, which are trusted by only 22% in Britain, 19% in Spain and 11% in Ireland (down from, respectively, 47%, 45% and 35% before the financial meltdown of 2008). Small firms are trusted more than big business in the developed world, by 76% to 53%; big is more trustworthy in emerging economies, by 79% to 70%. Why the big gap between trust in leaders and the institutions they lead? Edelman suggests that leaders have been slow to adapt to the requirements of a world in which top down is no longer the best way to lead, or in many cases even a viable one. Suffice it to say, there is nothing more top down than trying to lead the world from high up a mountain. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
Bloomberg just wrapped up its quarterly survey of global investors. According to Bloomberg'sÂ Rich MillerÂ &amp;Â Simon Kennedy, investors are the most optimistic on the prospect for stocks relative to other asset classes since 2009, when the survey began. Below are a few of the results from the survey. 53 percent of investors polled expect stocks to be the outperformers in 2013: Bloomberg TV However, only 53 percent of investors consider the U.S. economy to be in a state where it is "improving."

Two weeks ago, we saw investors stage one of the biggest pushes into equities of all time. A Citi analyst evenÂ compared the recent rally in stocksÂ to the rallies that led into the market highs of 2000 and 2007. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are near unanimous in predicting that U.S. stocks will advance around 10 percent this year, and Mohamed El-Erian seems poised to declare the "new normal" that has characterized the post-crash economic environment over. In short, everyone seems to be coming around to the same view.
simonhedlin.comTHE post-war generation of baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 - have had a huge appetite on the world, creating "youth culture", changing social attitudes from the sixties onwards, boosting economic growth as they entered the workforce and so on. Now they are starting to retire and this blog had banged on about the effect this will have on issues like pensions, asset markets and economic growth. not to worry, say some folk, since although we may have more elderly to look after, we will have fewer children. Alas, that won't help, as this graph compiled by statistician Simon Hedlin shows. The total dependency ratio (children and retirees, compared with those of working age) fell in all G20/OECD nations bar Germany and Sweden between 1960 and 2010. In the next fifty years, it will rise in all those nations, bar India and South Africa. In most nations, the ratio will rise by 40% or more; there are huge increases in dependency in parts of Asia (China and South Korea) and in eastern Europe. Britain and America are towards the bottom of the table, but their problems are big enough. There are many implications. With more dependents to care for, it is very hard to imagine how we will pay down our debts. And it is also very hard to imagine how one can possibly expect government spending to shrink significantly.

Activist investor Dan Loeb is short a multi-level marketing firm called Nu Skin, the NY Post reports. It's a firm whose fate has been somewhat tied to Herbalife's since investor David Einhorn jumped on an Herbalife earnings call last spring, and asked three questions that sent the stock plummeting. It may seem like an odd position, as Loeb announced earlier this month that he's long Herbalife, contrary to his fellow fund manager Bill Ackman, who has a massive short position in the stock. From the NY Post: ...Third Point takes a dim view of fellow multilevel-marketing company Nu Skin, whose stock trades in tandem with Herbalife. Third Point took a sizable short position in Nu Skin, which sells anti-aging products, after it began researching the company in the summer of 2011, said a source familiar with the situation who is neither long nor short in either company. The firm may have traded in and out of the position but was short as of last week, the source said. Per CNBC, Nu Skin stock is down 3.76% in pre market trading. When Einhorn questioned Herbalife back in May, Nu Skin shares tanked from $60 to $42 just because investors knew that the two companies shared the same business model. And a defamation suit filed in Salt Lake City, Utah by an ex-husband of Nu Skin founder Sandie Tillotson, suggests that the companies may share the same problems that Ackman alleges as well. From Barron's: Nu Skin shares (NUS) fell after an ex-husband of founder Sandie Tillotson allegedly disparaged her to "Wall Street insiders." Tillotson is an executive vice present and the largest individual shareholder of Nu Skin, a Provo, Utah-based outfit that sells its beauty products through thousands of independent distributors. Like other multilevel sales operations, Nu Skin exhorts distributors to recruit others who will, in turn, recruit recruits devoted to ordering company products. However, as we reported in our earlier story, regulatory filings indicate that most distributors never make a profit. The lack of profit is exactly what Einhorn suggested on his Herbalife call, and it's what sent Nu Skin stock down 9.06% when Ackman announced his Herbalife short in December. Another bearish voice in this conversation is Citron Research. Earlier this year Nu Skin said that China comprised almost 75% of its year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 alone, and that it expected more growth there and in other emerging markets. The problem with that, Citron pointed out, is that multi-level marketing firms are illegal in China, so the firm is skeptical of Nu Skin's continued growth there.

Now a â€œconfidentialâ€ report by the German version of the CIA, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), seeped to the surface. It sketched out the boomâ€™s geopolitical consequences. Biggest loser? China. BND reports have conveniently seeped out before. For instance, a â€œsecretâ€ report on how the pending bailout of Cyprus would use German taxpayer money to bail out rich Russians who have deposited their â€œblack moneyâ€ in the Cypriot banks caused an uproar [for that debacle read, The Bailout Of Russian â€œBlack Moneyâ€ In Cyprus]. The oil and gas boom is transforming the US, once the worldâ€™s largest oil importer. Natural gas production in the US already exceeds demand, and the glut last year forced prices down into the realm of maximum pain. So the US could become a major exporter of natural gasâ€”pending approval by the government and construction of LNG export terminals. Oil independence is tougher. The US is still a large oil importer. Yet, if the current boom dreams come true, the International Energy Agency (IEA) might be right in its estimate that the US could become the largest oil producer in the world by 2020, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. Even if that estimate is off the mark, the US will certainly be much less dependent on oil imported from countries other than its reliable neighbors, Mexico and Canada. One of the reasonsâ€”or perhaps the only reason, despite pretexts galoreâ€”the US has been so deeply involved in the Middle East, including long and expensive wars, and why the highly unpalatable regime of Saudi Arabia has been an anointed ally for decades, is oil. The US is hooked on it and must get enough of it at a manageable cost to keep the wheels of the economy greased. But if the US is able to do without oil from the region, it would give the government a lot more â€œfreedom to actâ€ in the realms of foreign policy and security, predicted the BND report. And the constant threat by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the oil from the Arabian Peninsula transits? It would be shrugged off in Washington. US independence from Arabian oil would impact the relationship and balance of power between the US and China, according to the BND report. Struggling to meets its skyrocketing demand for oil, China will buy about half of the oil produced on the Arabian peninsula, and it will, like the US before it, become dependent on itâ€”but unlike the US, it wonâ€™t have the military power, at least not initially, to protect its energy sources and transportation routes. The vast sums of money the US spent on military adventures worldwide, even the mere presence of its fleet, secured these transportation routes. To the great benefit of China. But once the US is no longer dependent on Arabian oil, the government might be unwilling to plow money into the military capability needed to secure the continued flow of oil from the region. â€œThe vulnerability of the Chinese energy supply routesâ€ would grow, the BND report predicted, which would give the US more leeway in dealing with China. Thus, in the worldwide geopolitical scramble caused by the US oil boom, China would be the biggest loser. Russia would also be a loser, according to the report. The main supplier of fossil fuels for central Europe would face more competition from countries, such as Nigeria, that used to deliver a significant portion of their production to the US. They would have to find other customers, including in Europe, Russiaâ€™s energy backyard. The ensuing downward pressure on prices could hit Russia where it is vulnerable: production costs in its frigid and remote northern areas are higher than in other parts of the world. And OPEC members would be losers. Their market power would dwindle further, and the cartelâ€™s feared ability to push up prices might drift toward irrelevanceâ€”as not only the US but numerous other countries, particularly in Africa, are beginning to experience their own oil booms [Kenyan Oil, Getting Hotter: Interview with Taipanâ€™s MaxwellÂ Birley]. Winners of the US oil boom? Oil importing countries, particularly those dependent on Russia, according to the BND. Among them Germany, which would â€œsignificantly increase the security of its energy supply.â€ In the US, the oil and gas boom would improve the competitiveness of the still listless economy as energy costs would decline, relative to other industrialized countries. For example, the cost of electricity in the US is already 40% lower than in Germany. Energy-intensive industries will find the US a more attractive location. The BND even sees the possibility that the US might be able to get a grip on its gargantuan trade deficit as oil imports shrink, cutting it in half by 2020â€”which, it imagines, would prop up the dollar as a reserve currency for a while longer. In its January report, OPEC said the US may post the highest oil-production increase among non-member states this yearâ€”while production in some member states is declining. And now, OPEC is fretting about Washington. Read.... Why OPEC Is Worried About The USÂ Congress.
FlickrShares of Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer, are falling in pre-market trading today following the company's announcement of a big writedown, made Friday after the closing bell. The $580 million charge relates to an acquisition Caterpillar made in China last year. It paid $800 million for the company, Siwei, but the target company's management team had apparently been fudging the books for quite some time before that, leading Caterpillar to wildly overpay for the acquisition. BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Ross Gjilardi has a good summary of the writedown: Big impairment charge tied to Siwei acquisition After the Friday close, Caterpillar announced that it will take a $580mn, or $0.87 per share non-cash goodwill accounting charge in Q412. The impairment comes in connection with the acquisition of ERA Mining Machinery and its Siwei subsidiary. The impairment arises from a determination by Caterpillar that Siwei senior managers engaged in accounting misconduct for several years prior to Caterpillarâ€™s $800mn acquisition of Siwei in mid-2012. The size of the charge equates to less than 1% of CATâ€™s market cap (but nearly 10% of adjusted 2012E EPS), but does not help perception of CATâ€™s China growth strategy, which is important to the long-term investment case, in our view. Accounting related issue â€“ ongoing investigation Caterpillar has determined that several Siwei senior managers engaged in deliberate misconduct beginning several years prior to the acquisition. According to CATâ€™s 8-K, the managers have been dismissed and replaced with a new leadership team, with the manufacturing operations rolled into Caterpillarâ€™s China operations division. CATâ€™s extensive review identified improper revenue recognition practices and cost allocation that resulted in overstated profit. Caterpillar is reviewing litigation closely and other options to recoup losses and is conducting an ongoing investigation. As Gjilardi noted, the charge will come out of Q4 2012 earnings, to be reported Monday, January 28. James Parker notes at the Diplomat that Siwei was part of one of the infamous "reverse mergers" that have plagued Chinese listings in recent years: Caterpillar last June acquired ERA Mining Machinery Ltd, a HK-listed company that was in fact the result of a â€œbackdoor listingâ€ of Siwei, a Zhengzhou-based company which provides equipment for the mining industry. Siwei had undertaken a â€œreverse mergerâ€ with ERA Holdings Global Ltd (a â€œsecretarial servicesâ€ company listed on HK that had no relation to mining or construction) in 2010, and had thus been effectively trading on HKâ€™s Growth Enterprise Market. Reverse mergers, which rose to infamy during recent short-seller provoked attacks on such firms trading in the United States and Canada, are a common way for companies to be listed without going through the more expensive (and revealing) regulatory and media scrutiny of an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Below is the full press release issued by Caterpillar, complete with a Q&amp;A: PEORIA, Ill., Jan. 18, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) today announced that an internal investigation of its recently acquired company, ERA Mining Machinery Limited (ERA), including its wholly owned subsidiary Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical &amp; Electrical Manufacturing Co., Ltd., commonly known as "Siwei," has uncovered deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct concealed at Siwei, located in Zhengzhou, China. Caterpillar's investigation determined several Siwei senior managers engaged in deliberate misconduct beginning several years prior to Caterpillar's acquisition of Siwei. This deliberate misconduct at Siwei will result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $580 million, or $0.87 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2012. Caterpillar removed several senior managers at Siwei who were responsible for the misconduct and a new leadership team has been put in place. The responsibilities for Siwei manufacturing operations have been moved to Caterpillar's China Operations Division, led by Vice President Qihua Chen, a long time Caterpillar employee. The sales and support organization at Siwei will report to Kebao Yang, Caterpillar Global Mining General Manager for China and Korea. "The actions carried out by these individuals are offensive and completely unacceptable. This conduct does not represent, in any way, shape or form, the way Caterpillar does business or how we expect our employees to work, which is spelled out in Caterpillar's Worldwide Code of Conduct," said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman. "Once our investigation confirmed that misconduct had taken place at Siwei, we moved quickly and decisively to hold the responsible leaders directly accountable for the wrongdoing. Accountability is a critical way that we measure leaders at Caterpillar, and it is my expectation that leaders set an example and are accountable for their actions and results." Caterpillar has advised the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission of these issues and has filed a Form 8-K with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing the impairment charge. Caterpillar's investigation is ongoing. "Despite these actions we continue to believe that the Siwei acquisition is well aligned with our strategy to expand our role as a leading equipment and solutions provider for the Chinese coal mining industry," said Steve Wunning, Caterpillar group president with responsibility for Resource Industries. "We intend to utilize Siwei roof support products and manufacturing capabilities, combined with Caterpillar's strong commitment to technical innovation and safety, to help our mining customers in China become more efficient and safer within their mines," Wunning added. Additional background on Siwei acquisition: In November of 2011, Caterpillar and ERA jointly announced a pre-conditional voluntary offer by Caterpillar, through a wholly owned subsidiary, for all of the issued shares of ERA, which at that time was a publicly traded company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ERA primarily designed, manufactured, sold and supported underground coal mining equipment in China through its wholly owned subsidiary, Siwei. In June of 2012, Caterpillar announced the completion of its tender offer for ERA, including its wholly owned subsidiary Siwei. The tender offer was completed after approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM). Siwei has a manufacturing base of 600,000 square meters and employs about 4,000 people in Zhengzhou, Henan province, where Caterpillar intends to continue manufacturing roof support equipment to serve underground mining customers in China. Questions and Answers: Q1: Does the discovery of this misconduct at Siwei change Caterpillar's strategy for China or its view of the mining industry? A:Â No. Caterpillar has 23 existing manufacturing facilities in China, four new facilities under construction, four Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) centers and three logistics and parts centers, employing more than 15,000 people across the country. In addition, China produces and consumes more coal than any other country in the world. Our strategy to expand our coal mining business in China is unchanged, and we are optimistic about the underground coal mining equipment opportunities. The accounting misconduct that occurred at Siwei does not reflect the way Caterpillar does business and is not in keeping with our Worldwide Code of Conduct. The actions of the individuals involved were clearly wrong and purposely designed to overstate the profitability of the company prior to our acquisition. This does not change our plans to develop, grow, and improve the business. The acquisition is aligned with Caterpillar's strategy to expand in the rapidly growing Chinese coal mining equipment industry utilizing the Siwei roof support products and manufacturing capabilities, combined with Caterpillar's strong commitment to product innovation and safety, to help our mining customers in China become more efficient and safer within their mines. Q2: What is Caterpillar's due diligence process for mergers and acquisitions? A: We believe our process is rigorous and robust and includes Caterpillar personnel and outside accounting, legal and financial advisors. It is important to understand that Siwei was a publicly traded company with audited financial statements. What we discovered at Siwei following the acquisition was deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct that was concealed by the persons responsible. Q3: Can you provide more details about the nature of the accounting misconduct? A: Caterpillar first became concerned about an issue when discrepancies were identified in November 2012 between the inventory recorded in Siwei's accounting records and the company's actual physical inventory. This was determined by a physical inventory count conducted at Siwei as part of Caterpillar's integration process. Caterpillar promptly launched a comprehensive review and investigation into the nature and source of this discrepancy. This extensive review has identified inappropriate accounting practices involving improper cost allocation that resulted in overstated profit. The review further identified improper revenue recognition practices involving early and, at times unsupported, revenue recognition. This review is ongoing. Q4: Several individuals on Siwei's board of directors were part of the ownership structure of ERA. Did the investigation determine if ERA or its principals had any knowledge of this misconduct? A: Caterpillar's investigation of these matters is ongoing and any other comment at this time is not appropriate. Q5: How does the announcement about Siwei change Caterpillar's previously-stated outlook for 2012 and its preliminary outlook for 2013? A: The accounting misconduct described in today's announcement was discovered after Caterpillar released its most recent outlook for 2012. The expected charge of approximately $580 million, or $0.87 per share will be included in fourth-quarter 2012 financial results, but was not anticipated in the 2012 outlook. We do not expect these matters related to Siwei to have a significant impact on Caterpillar's 2013 sales and revenues or profit. We will provide our 2013 outlook with our Earnings Release on January 28 but are not updating the outlook today. Q6: Will there be litigation as a result of the investigation? A: Caterpillar is reviewing these matters very closely and is considering all of its options to recover its losses from those responsible. Q7: Was the conduct you have described criminal? Has anyone been arrested or is this being investigated by the U.S. or Chinese governments? A: Caterpillar is not aware of any arrests or criminal investigations. If contacted by governmental authorities, Caterpillar will cooperate. Q8: In light of the circumstances, do you intend to keep the Siwei name or will the business be rebranded as Caterpillar? A: At this point, there are no plans to remove the Siwei name. The company maintains a strong reputation in the marketplace. Caterpillar intends to build on Siwei's strengths. The Siwei roof support business is a good complement to our existing product line for our mining customers, and we remain committed to our continued investment in China to support our growing base of customers. Q9: Did the investigation determine whether any Caterpillar employees, beyond those who came over to Caterpillar as part of the Siwei acquisition, had any knowledge of, or participated in, this misconduct? A: The misconduct at issue commenced at Siwei well in advance of Caterpillar's acquisition. We believe it was perpetrated without the knowledge of any Caterpillar employee who did not come over to Caterpillar as part of the Siwei acquisition.

That verbiage has been phenomenally successful: the stock market is surging, and the yen is crashing from historicâ€”under normal circumstances, inexplicableâ€”highs. But now, US automakers are squealing. They want the government to fight back in the currency war. The American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC), a lobbying organization that represents only Ford, GM, and Chrysler, sent President Obama a letter, demanding retaliation against Japanâ€™s NO EXIT strategy. Then it went public with it grievances. â€œHere we go again,â€ said Matt Blunt, AAPC president and former Republican governor of Missouri. â€œJapanâ€™s Liberal Democratic party is back in power and determined to repeat the â€˜beggar thy neighborâ€™ policies that distort trade by cheapening the value of the yen to promote economic growth in Japan at the expense of its trading partners.â€ He claimed that â€œthese types of policiesâ€ had â€œinflicted tremendous harmâ€ on manufacturing in the US. â€œWe urge the Obama Administration to make it clear to Japan that such policies are unacceptable and will be met by reciprocal measures.â€ The AAPC has been lambasting Japan, and rightfully so, for having â€œthe most closed auto market in the developed world,â€ protected by â€œnon-tariff barriersâ€ that keep US automotive products out. But now it accused Japan of manipulating its currency â€œto boost its own exports at the expense of other nations, especially the United States.â€ Alas, the biggest currency manipulator in the world is the Fed, not only with its verbiage but also with its endless and escalating waves of quantitative easing, to the point where it currently prints $85 billion a month to debase and demolish the dollar, or what is left of it, which isnâ€™t much. It makes US wages more competitive with those in Mexico and China. It also makes imports more expensive for American consumers and exports cheaper for consumers elsewhere. Meanwhile, Japanâ€™s infamous trade surplus has given way to a ballooning trade deficit (graph). The automakers were whining to President Obama, ironically, as another announcement was made and received with hoopla: GM would invest $1.5 billion in plants in North America in 2013. While no further details emerged, hopes were swirling that this manna would rain down on Michigan. Yet North America, in addition to Michigan, also includes among other places Canada and Mexico, and how much of this money will land in the US is uncertain. Embarrassingly, the $1.5 billion was just a fraction of GMâ€™s planned investments of $8 billion for 2013, of which $6.5 billion will be sent to countries outside North Americaâ€”not Europe where GM is bleeding to death, but Asia. That has been the paradigm in manufacturing for decades. US corporations have invested prodigiously in China and other countries where labor is cheap and have thus contributed to their enormous economic growth, while only crumbs have fallen on US soil. In this manner, much of the US auto component industry has moved offshore. Exhibit A: Delphi, formerly GMâ€™s component division. GM spun it off in 1999. Two years later, Delphi axed 11,500 workers. In 2004, it got into hot water over its accounting practices. In 2005, it went bankrupt and closed 45 plants in the US, with much of the production moving to China. In 2009, it sold its chassis division to state-owned BeijingWest Industries, which now develops and manufactures brake and chassis components for US and European automakers. Exhibit B: Visteon, formerly Fordâ€™s component division. Always the laggard, Ford spun it off in 2000. In 2009, it went bankrupt, shuttered all but one of its 33 plants in the US, let go 25,000 workers, and shifted its center of gravity to Shanghai. It now has 171 plants and facilities in other countries. Its headquarters building in Van Buren Township, Michigan, was sold last year, though its headquarters is still officially located there. Visteon is still â€œa US company at this point,â€ CEO Tim Leuliette said at the Automotive News World Congress on Wednesday. Yet globally, he added, only â€œabout 4%, 5% of our employees are in the United States,â€ most of them supporting customers in North America. So, if the headquarters shifted to Asia, he said, it wouldnâ€™t change much, jobs-wise. Bitter irony: American automakers, after having sent their investments and manufacturing overseas, are using a Republican ex-governor to pressure the Obama administration to stop the Japanese from defending themselves in the currency war that the Fed has been waging relentlessly for years. Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher is waging his own warâ€”against TBTF banks. â€œRepressionâ€ is what he calls â€œthe injustice of being held hostage to large financial institutions,â€ whose investors, executives, counterparties, and customers are â€œexempt from the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction.â€ For that whole debacle, read.... How Big IsÂ â€BIGâ€?

I don't use Yelp and never wanted a better one.  It is what it is--less a discovery platform and more of a way to check on places you already heard about elsewhere.  Besides, Yelp's core product is its killer sales team and ability to sell.  It was never that great of a user experience.  If you want to beat Yelp, you need to reinvent the product it gives to merchants, not the product on the phone. Foursquare's product has moved away from two things--gaming and social, the two core aspects of what led to its growth in the first place.  It's also what the team was good at.  When times get tough, I generally tell people to start with what you know and build from there.   I'm hoping that it will retrench and return to those roots--because I actually think that's going to be key to returning to growth and building a business. The game kind of went away by itself.  Mayorships were never really that scalable in the first place.  Only one person could be Mayor and, eventually, the person who frequents that venue everyday is the one who holds onto it and never lets go.  In a city where the app has high penetration, Mayorship turnovers are rare.  Creating levels around badges seemed to be an attempt to scale that system, but when you don't know what you need to do to win one and the badges aren't new to you, they fail to capture your interest.  It's like when I studied Tae Kwon Do.  Getting my blackbelt was a major goal of mine--but becoming a second, third or fourth degree didn't hold the same interest and so I moved onto other hobbies after six or seven years of working towards black.   Social moved to the side seemingly as a result of trying to move the app more into the mainstream.  In a world where not everyone wants to check-in, then Explore, so it was thought, had to become front and center so anyone can feed off the data and get recommendations.   While finding out where your friends were and interacting with them in a stream wasn't necessarily a huge growth opportunity, deemphasizing that seemed to open up a flank for apps like Instagram and Path to take over that mindshare.  If I want to know what my friends are doing--I can just as easily see where they're taking Instagram photos--especially given that they're using the Foursquare API to attach those photos to places. It seems that growth and excitement around Foursquare has come down.  I still use it regularly, but I'll admit that I don't check-in wherever I go--especially in a world of crappy cell bandwidth where it isn't always fast to load up a place and find the venue.  It's impossible to win a Mayorship anywhere in NYC anyway--so sometimes it's just easier to snap an Instagram photo and kill two birds with one stone.   What I really want is that app that made it more fun to interact with the world around me and be more social with friends in real life--and I think it's very possible. The key?  Lists. Before Wander, Jeremy Fisher built a site called Dinevore.  I was the site's most hardcore user, despite its overly complicated interface.  I loved the concept--publisher lists of "Top 25 Brooklyn Eats" and "Best Burger in NYC" were the main attraction, as were user created lists like "Places you're likely to run into a VC."  Dinevore never made it to mobile, little time was spent on acquiring more publisher lists, and Jeremy moved onto Wander.   Still, I thought the lists were brilliant.  Humans love lists.  They love crossing off lists and getting to the end.  It feels like a sense of accomplishment.  They love sharing lists and they make for great SEO bait.  Lists also negate the need for complicated recommendation algorithms.  Instead of trying to figure out where the "best brunch" is by searching user comments on venues, then pulling in social data, you know that someone's already created that list--and you can just rank places depending on how many times they appear on publisher lists, weighted by the quality of the publisher.  This is what Google does and it works.  When you search for "best brunch in NYC", you get lots of publisher lists--and they're pretty good to be honest.  Are they the single perfect recommendation based on time, coordinates, your friends, etc?  No, but they don't have to be.  That's a tough game to play.  Instead, I'm pretty sure if I ate at every one of the places featured on Refinery29's best brunch list, I'd have a pretty good brunch experience.  It would keep me incentivized to keep engaging with the app over time as well, because I'd keep coming back to see where to go next.   By bringing publisher lists into the equation, you also give publishers a way for them to reach their audience on phones.  Every publisher recommendation list should come with an "Add to Foursquare" button.  They tried that a while back and never seemed to push that through as a strategy.  When you add a whole list at a time, you give a new user a set of goals that should keep them engaged for a while.  You could even give people on site recognition on publisher sites when they've reached that goal--so that when I visit the page announcing the Eater 38, I can see all the people, including my friends, who have been to all 38 places.   Accomplishing lists is also much more scalable than a Mayorship and Badge system.  It takes longer to run through a list--and there are always lots of lists specific to you that you'd care about. Sharing lists also leads to what a more social Foursquare should look like--something that actually gets me to interact with my friends in real life.  Just watching streams gets kind of tiresome after a while--and it's nothing that Foursquare has any innate advantage over than Instagram or Path.  The difference could be that those two apps have zero chance of getting me to actually show up somewhere to meet a friend.  That is much more emotionally meaningful to me than seeing a picture, and driving foot traffic to venues is... oh, what do you call that... that's right... a business.   One of the buried features of Dinevore was the ability to see which venues were on your friends' To Do lists.  Everyone had a To Do list because the whole point of the site was about completing the lists.  It made for a well informed answer to "Where should we go?"  When you suggest going to a place with friends and they say, "Oh, great, I've been dying to go there!" it's pure geosocial gold.  Foursquare should suggest people to hangout with and the places to go with them when they overlap--especially since they know who my closer friends are given who I've checked in together with and commented at.   The great thing for Foursquare is that it already has all of these features, in parts.  Lists are buried in the app right now.  It's just a design question to make them more important, specifically my friends' To Do's--as well as a business development strategy to get more publishers actively creating them.   If lists became front and center in the mobile app, Foursquare would accomplish three things: a) It would kill off the awkward divide between using it for recommendations and being social--which feels like two separate things now. b) It would engage people with a game they already play.  The mobile app Matchbook proved out the same thing--reaching fantastic engagement because "normals" make lists of places they want to go to. c) It would engage publishers in a better app distribution strategy.  There's got to be some version of a list leaderboard and an add this list button that publishers would go for--and getting that kind of screen real estate, as well as a targeted scavenger hunt of sorts, could kickstart Foursquare's growth again. The Foursquare I want to see will help me circle through the top eats in Brooklyn and tell me which of my friends also want to do so.  It will be more about inspiring me to go out and be social--something that even parents with kids can plan ahead to do--rather than help me figure out what to do when I'm already out, which is a niche use case in my mind.   In any case, whether this is the strategy or something else is, I hope Foursquare figures it out.  Foursquare's fate is emotionally meaningful to the NYC startup scene, even if, in the grand scheme of things, it's not the biggest, and you've got companies out there with lots of revs like Appnexus, Gilt, Etsy, Fab and ZocDoc.  Foursquare, for a moment, seemed more "ours" and its funding in 2009 is what turned the VC engine back on in NYC.

From Nouriel Roubini's yfrog pageTired of all this bullishness, and talk about how there's nothing to worry about anymore? Don't worry. That's why God gave us Nouriel Roubini. He has a new article at Project Syndicate that could pretty much be titled: Things still suck. It's actually titled The Economic Fundamentals of 2013 and, spoiler alert, he says the fundamentals aren't good. Roubini identifies four big risks to the global economy. They are: He concludes: While the chance of a perfect storm â€“ with all of these risks materializing in their most virulent form â€“ is low, any one of them alone would be enough to stall the global economy and tip it into recession. And while they may not all emerge in the most extreme way, each is or will be appearing in some form. As 2013 begins, the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force.

Time Warner has announced that it is spending $50 million on ads in a variety of traditional and online media to win back customers it has lost. Why is the company doing this? Time Warner representatives would like you to think that it is because they are â€œnice guysâ€ and their service has improved. As quoted in the New York Times, Jeffrey A. Hirsch, the chief marketing officer of Time Warner Cable says, â€œWe, as a company, are fundamentally different and better than we were a few years ago when these upstart competitors started coming in.â€ Could the real reason be better competition and lost business? Better competitors Yes, these upstart competitors â€“ AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FIOS, and satellite TV providers Dish Network and DirecTV are â€œupstartsâ€ because they have done a better job of taking care of their customers. What a novel idea! According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index for Subscription Television Service, Time Warner ranks below average and near the bottom, and these upstarts are all above average. Time Warner Cable is losing subscribers The most likely reason Time Warner is feeling compelled to improve their service and advertise its improvements is they have been losing subscribers. According to the latest available data, Time Warner lost 140,000 subscribers in the 3rd quarter of 2012 â€“ an increase over the 129,000 they lost in the same quarter of 2011. In addition to losing subscribers to competitive services, many TV households are cutting the cord by watching TV and videos online or switching to free broadcast TV. There are many more choices than ever thanks to the ability to view content on desktops, laptops and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Losing subscribers translates to losing revenue According to ABI research the worldwide pay TV market was $236 billion by the end of 2012. Pay TV revenue in North America is expected to peak in 2013 and gradually fall to $88.2 billion by 2017. This will cause pay-TV operators to fight each other for subscribers. This is likely the impetus behind Time Warnerâ€™s ad campaign. Now that many have left, they want us back because their business is turning into a zero-sum game. Not only that. Options offered by Netflix, Hulu, and others are, in many cases, are more flexible and less expensive. Understanding the Lifetime value of a customer Too bad the cable TV operators, such as Time Warner, donâ€™t seem to understand the Lifetime Value of a customer. If they did, they would not have to spend so much money getting back what they lost. They would have taken better care of those who called to complain about outages or snow on their TV sets. They would have done a better job of training customer service people who routinely â€œplayed dumbâ€ during an outage or were rude to subscribers calling for service. They would not have made it so difficult for subscribers to get credits for outages and other technical problems. The executives in these companies need to understand that they exist and prosper because they satisfy the needs of their customers. If they take care of customers, the money will follow. If they chase after the money by cutting customer service quality or charging for previously included items, as they have done since they started in the cable TV business, they will end up losing the customers and money. Most important of all, they should understand that actions that are viewed to be exploitative and insensitive only cause many to no longer trust them. Once they lose the trust of the public, it is hard to get it back. Even if the ad campaign is exceptional, it will not work unless the product is significantly improved. For too many, the wounds are too deep, the switching costs are too high, and the trust is long gone. DON'T MISS: The 15 Worst Companies For Customer Service &gt;
Flickr / Brian DigitalTo really appreciate this moment, you really need to appreciate the explosion of optimism that's broken out in global financial markets. It's not just that the S&amp;P is near all-time highs. It's not just that pro-investors are more in stocks than they've been in years. It's also that economic skeptics are starting o throw in the towel, and accept that the economy is back. Either that's a great sign, or it's a sign that things have gotten way to extreme on the positivity front. Anyway, SocGen's Kit Juckes sums up the bearish plight in one sentence: The reality is that we are short of things to worry about and long of liquidity which tends to weaken the resolve of any bear. Sounds right. Oh, and the title of Juckes' note? "Looking for something to worry about." Be afraid!
Vince Bucci/Getty ImagesGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
Bogdan Migulski via FlickrThe big story of the day: Late Monday night (US time), the Bank of Japan announced a new 2% inflation target, and an unlimited bond purchase plan. But markets have mostly been disappointed. We already gave you the explanation from SocGen's Kit Juckes. Here's Nomura's Shuichi Obata on the same: Although the introduction of an inflation target was in line with market expectations, the markets are likely to have been disappointed by the details of the open-ended asset purchasing program, namely that: (1) it only starts in 2014; (2) monthly purchases will be offset by redemptions, such that net growth in the asset purchasing program is likely to be only around Â¥10trn by end-2014; and (3) the BOJ does not envision any net growth in the size of the asset purchasing program from 2015.
From Calculated Risk, here are the two key pieces of data coming out today: â€¢ At 10:00 AM, Existing Home Sales for December from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The consensus is for sales of 5.10 million on seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) basis. Economist Tom Lawler estimates the NAR will report sales at 4.97 million SAAR.â€¢ Also at 10:00 AM, the Richmond Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity for January. The consensus is for a a reading of 5 for this survey, unchanged from December (Above zero is expansion). Both are important. The latter will be particularly interesting, as we've been getting some weak regional Fed numbers (Empire, Philly), lately. Bad numbers augur poorly for the next ISM report.
Despite an average EPS Beat Rate of 79% and an average Revenue Beat Rate of 82%, Google (GOOG) historically dropped precipitously more than 75% of the time in the week (seven calendar days) following its earnings reports over the last four quarters, losing an average of 5.38%. This is a far more substantial drop than either the market or the tech sector as a whole, neither of which decline substantially more than 1.5% over the same period.   Even when the earnings releases over the last eight quarters are taken into account, Google still declines more precipitously than the market as a whole over the following week, losing an average of 2.03%, compared to an average 0.23% overall decline in the Nasdaq over the same period. Most strikingly, over the last eight earnings releases, Google declines during the following week more than 60% of the time.

Interesting new paper here from UCLAâ€™s Ed Leamer in which he argues that housing is the business cycle: â€œOf the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylorâ€™s output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.â€ Iâ€™d have to dive a bit deeper into this, but I do have to wonder if there isnâ€™t a bit of recency bias in this data as real estate has disproportionately driven the US economy in the last decade. Â My thinking: BUT, with the epicenter of the balance sheet recession being real estate, weâ€™re likely to see a good multiplier effect coming from the recent positive activity in real estate. Â So maybe the recency bias is warrantedâ€¦.FOR NOW.
jurvetson / FlickrKind of a rocky morning. After tanking earlier -- perhaps due to false rumors about Bundesbank Chief Jens Weidmann resigning -- now the Euro is tanking. Helping things out: A huge upward spike in economic optimism, as measured by the ZEW survey. From the report (.pdf): The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany has increased by 24.6 points in January 2013. The indicator now stands at a level of 31.5 points, thereby reaching its highest level since May 2010. The indicator’s further increase shows that according to the financial market experts the economic perspectives for Germany have brightened up on a six months’ time horizon. It might have contributed to experts’ optimism that the markets’ uncertainty concerning the future of the Eurozone has diminished for the time being.
Jana Kasperkevic/Business InsiderDan Greenhaus of BTIG splashes some cold water on the idea that Washington is going to sail through the upcoming budget thicket:  Not unimportantly for stocks on Friday and in front of today’s inauguration ceremonies, Republicans emerged from their VA retreat seemingly realigned. The reporting since suggests that Republican leadership was able to convince the rank of rile that going to the mats over the debt ceiling at this point was foolish and a political loser. The three month extension floated on Friday was by definition an effort to push the ceiling into “third position,” behind the budget expiration and sequester. Arranging the debate this way forces Democrats to confront the budget issue before the Republicans can make an issue out of the debt ceiling but does nothing to address “fiscal cliff forever” syndrome. Of course, with Chuck Schumer suggesting on Meet the Press that additional revenues will be in any new Senate budget, our view that the government will shut down come late March/early April holds for now.
Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann expressed concern Monday about threats to the independence of central banks, particularly in Japan and Hungary, which he warned could sharply politicise exchange rate policy. "We are witnessing disturbing abuses, for example in Hungary or in Japan, where the new government is interfering massively in the affairs of the central bank, calling forcefully for a more aggressive monetary policy," Weidmann said at a new year reception at the Frankfurt stock exchange's operator, Deutsche Boerse. Central banks of major industrialised countries were granted independence from government control in the 1970s and 1980s in order to break double-digit inflation. The German central bank is traditionally a hawk against inflation risks, but Weidmann also warned an unintended consequence of governments dictating monetary policy "could be a much stronger politicising of exchange rates." "Up to now the international monetary system has weathered the crisis and avoided a devaluation race and I hope very much that will remain the case," he added. The monetary easing policies undertaken by the central banks of numerous industrialised countries during the crisis, primarily aimed at unfreezing financial markets, have also tended to lower the value of their currencies. While a number of emerging nations such as Brazil were unhappy and spoke of "currency wars", independent central banks have not engaged in devaluations to improve the competitiveness of their nations' exports. The Bank of Japan was due to conclude Tuesday its first policy meeting since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office with a pledge to pressure it into aggressive monetary easing to revive the long-suffering economy. The two-day meeting is widely expected to see the central bank launch another round of easing, and bow to government demands that it set a two-percent inflation target in a bid to vanquish the deflation that has haunted the world's third largest economy for years. Abe has not hidden he aims to appoint a replacement to the current head of the central bank, whose term ends soon, that shares his government's views. His comments have led to a significant weakening of the yen in recent weeks, a boon to Japanese exporters. In Hungary, conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban will also soon have the opportunity to appoint a new central bank head, and is widely expected to appoint one of his loyal allies. Last year he packed MNB's monetary policy committee with his supporters, which have outvoted the independent members to push through cuts in interest rates despite rising inflation, which at 5.7 percent in 2012 was the highest in the European Union. The EU and International Monetary Fund have expressed concern about the loss of central bank independence in Hungary and have not moved forward with providing Budapest with a 15-billion-euro ($20 billion) precautionary credit line.

Wikimedia CommonsSo the Bank of Japan announced a new, more aggressive inflation target, coupled with unlimited asset purchases, last night. And yet the Nikkei fell and the yen is on a tear. What gives? Well, one, there's almost certainly a "sell the news" element, as this was seen for miles away. But in terms of specific, the bank maybe didn't go as far as it could have. SocGen currency strategist Kit Juckes explains that the action isn't aggressive as the headline suggests.  Please Sir, I want more, said Oliver Twist, fed up with a diet of thin gruel. Such is the market's response to news in Japan. The Bank of Japan announced that from January 2014, it will embark on open-ended bond purchases, buying Y13trn in bonds a month (but only Y2trn a month in JGBs), until such a time as its new 2% inflation target is met. The new programme starts so far away because that is when the current round of bond-buying will have run its course, but the BOJ could have increased the pace of bond-buying immediately, and the 2% inflation target is viewed by some commentators overnight as disappointing because there is no specific timeline attached to it. So disappointment on three fronts: The inflation target has no fixed time limit, the bond purchases are still skewed to the short end of the curve, and they don't start soon enough. Japan has consistently failed to achieve 1% inflation and increasing the target to 2% is reminiscent of an overweight currency strategist aiming for a greater weight loss, to make up for past failure to diet. The key is not the target but what is done to achieve it. However, a commitment to buy bonds until the target is reached will lead to substantial bond purchases and will eventually bear fruit, delivering a weaker currency. The relative growth rates of the Fed and ECB's balance sheets has been a driver of EUR/USD, and the BOJ is likely to be growing its balance sheet faster than other major central banks in the future, if only because hitting the 2% inflation target is going to be very difficult.

It's not clear what's going on, exactly, but there's been a sharp bout of Euro area selling. The DAX has dropped over 1.3%. And the Euro has plunged, per this chart from FinViz: FinViz It's already a risk off day, but around 4 AM things really took a jolt. UPDATE: There had been a seemingly twitter-borne rumor about Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann resigning. The Bundesbank has rejected that in strong terms. Bundesbank: Market Rumor Of Weidmann Resignation "Utter Garbage"
Mandel Ngan/Getty ImagesGood morning. The big story: Late last night, the Bank of Japan unleashed its widely expected, but historic easing. It set an inflation target of 2%, and announced unlimited QE. As it was expected, the yen spiked on the news, and the Nikkei eventually ended lower. Meanwhile European markets are tumbling, with big indices off over 1%. The US market was closed yesterday, so it will be playing catch up. For more on why the BOJ's move was a disappointment to markets, see here &gt;
AP Photo/Matt YorkNational home prices were up 5.9 percent year-over-year in 2012, according to Zillow's latest real estate market report. This was the largest annual gain since August 2006, and home prices were up for four straight quarters.Â  Meanwhile, the Zillow Home Value Index rose to $157,400 in the fourth quarter.Â  â€œWe expected 2012 to be a good year for housing, and it delivered in spades. Strong demand paired with limited inventory in many markets helped fuel a robust and often rapid recovery in overall home values, good news for homeowners after years of poor performance,â€ said Zillow Chief Economist Stan Humphries in a press release.Â  Of the 30 biggest metros Chicago and Cincinnati were the only two that didn't show quarterly or annual increases. Home prices are expected to rise 3.3 percent in 2013 but Humphries warned that consumers shouldn't expect such a strong performance this year. â€œItâ€™s important to be cautious moving forward, even as we celebrate the undeniably positive end to 2012, and be careful that consumers don't grow to expect such high appreciation as the norm. Buying a home should be a long-term decision, and these swings between a deep housing recession and higher-than-normal appreciation rates can give consumers whiplash and cause some to lose sight of that.â€ Note: Zillow issued a correction to their press release to say home prices were up for four straight quarters.
