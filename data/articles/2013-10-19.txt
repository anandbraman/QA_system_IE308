
Despite the short-term nature of the fix, news of an imminent deal boosted markets. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.4 percent on Wednesday, leaving both just shy of the historic highs both indices reached Sept. 18. And yields on Treasury bills with maturity dates from October 17 through October 31 fell 24 to 30 basis points, Credit Suisseâ€™s U.S. Interest Rate Strategy team reported. Longer-dated Treasury bond yields fell slightly, too, with 10-year bonds registering a 0.06 percentage-point decrease to 2.69 percent. Two-year and 5-year bonds saw smaller decreases â€“ 0.03 percentage points and 0.04 percentage points, respectively. That all makes sense. What doesnâ€™t? The fact that many corners of the financial markets hadnâ€™t much reacted to the impasse in the first place. Never mind that International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned that a default could send the global economy into recession again. Never mind that Fitch Ratings put the U.S. on notice that the logjam could lead to a downgrade of the countryâ€™s triple-A credit score, a move fellow ratings agency Standard &amp; Poorâ€™s made during the last such crisis in 2011. â€œTraditional (currency) â€™safe havensâ€™ such as the Swiss franc and the yen have failed to gain a substantial bid,â€ Credit Suisse analysts mused in a recent note called â€œKicking the Can Down the Road Again,â€ adding that â€œ[it] is notable that U.S. consumer confidence has dipped far less in the current episode than in previous comparable periods.â€ Were we really not that concerned about the thing we were all concerned about? Apparently not: The S&amp;P 500 hit its lowest point in a month on Oct. 8, but that was just 4 percent off its Sept. 18 high. That same day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 5.7 percent from its own September high. â€œIt was remarkable how sanguine our markets were,â€ Scott Smith, a financial services sector strategist at Credit Suisse, said on a call with investors earlier this week. â€œNobody seemed to think anything was going to happen.â€ There was clear action in those securities that were first in the line of fire, in particular short-term U.S. treasuries. But longer-dated Treasury yields barely budged over the course of October. â€œWe did see significant moves in the T-bill market,â€ Ira Jersey, an interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said on the investor call. Last week, when there was no deal in sight, investors started to flee from Treasury bills maturing on Oct. 24 and Oct. 31, driving prices down. And when the idea of a six-week debt ceiling extension was floated at weekâ€™s end, December bills followed the same pattern, while prices on October bills recovered. This past Tuesday, when February started to leak out as the new debt date, it all happened again. All that said, investors may be experiencing dÃ©jÃ  vu in just 113 days, so itâ€™s worth considering what would have happened if a default had occurred. James Sweeney, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse, pointed out in a recent note entitled â€œDebt Fight Testâ€ that some of the institutions and people who hold T-bills would presumably need the money the government owed them right away â€“ not unlike someone who needs payday to come before they write the rent check. If the Treasury failed to pay on time, many T-bill investors might need to borrow money from somewhere else to cover their own obligations. But a failure by the issuer of the worldâ€™s reserve currency to pay up on time could have caused a panic attack in global financial markets. Even after that panic subsided, argued Sweeney, if this pattern of political brinksmanship continues, Uncle Samâ€™s borrowing costs could indeed rise permanently. While most of the focus has rightly been on the financial crisis avoided by lifting the debt ceiling, the first estimates have emerged of the damage done to the American economy by the 16-day government shutdown that occurred alongside the debt debate. Standard &amp; Poorâ€™s estimated that the shutdown cost the U.S. economy $24 billion, or 0.6 percent of GDP. The double whammy of the shutdown and the debt fight has had one major implication for the global economy. No one is talking anymore about an imminent slowing of the Federal Reserveâ€™s monthly asset purchases that have been greasing the wheels of the U.S. economy. The Fed has long said that their decision to slow the purchases would depend on economic data, much of which was unavailable while the federal government was shut down. So donâ€™t expect any sudden moves out of Bernanke and Co. anytime soon. In their â€œKicking the Can Down the Road Againâ€ note, Credit Suisse analysts said that due to the uncertainty â€œtapering is a Q1 proposition.â€ See you in the same place in a few months?
Jeffrey Gundlach, the CEO and CIO of DoubleLine Capital, became the latest major investor to weigh in on Carl Icahn’s perspective on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. While talking about Apple during an appearance on CNBC earlier this week, Gundlach stated that, “I disagree with people who say it’s a no brainer.” “That might have been true at $400, but no longer at $500,” added Gundlach. Although Gundlach didn’t refer to Icahn by name, the billionaire investor has famously said more than once that investing in Apple is a “no brainer.” Icahn is also pushing Apple to expand its share buyback program by borrowing $150 billion in funds. Gundlach isn’t the only investor to disagree with Icahn’s characterization of Apple stock. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross recently told CNBC, “I’m not absolutely sure that no-brainer trades exist. I have a tough time finding no-brainer trades. There’s usually a reason why somebody’s on the other side.” However, Gundlach apparently isn’t against owning Apple stock. “I like Apple okay, I think it’s a fairly safe thing to own,” he stated via Barron’s. Gundlach is perhaps best known for making a famously accurate call when he began shorting Apple in April of 2012 when it was still trading for around $610. Icahn’s views on Apple have generated plenty of commentary from other major investors. Although he didn’t mention Icahn’s “no brainer” comment, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRKA) (NYSE:BRKB) Warren Buffett recently dismissed Icahn’s effort to increase Apple’s share buyback program by saying, “I do not think that companies should be run primarily to please Wall Street and largely shareholders who are going to sell.” Here’s how Apple closed out the trading week on Friday. 
If you've walked down the alcohol aisle in the past few years â€” and let's face it, you have â€” you've surely been witness to the flavorific bubble mentality of today's liquor brands. Particularly when it comes to vodka, where you can purchase Three Olives' Triple Shot Espresso, Tartz, and whatever flavor "Dude" is. But I don't care for vodka, so the fact that the area between Smirnoff and Popov looks increasingly like a bag of Skittles hasn't bothered me. I am a gin drinker. In case you haven't noticed, we're in a gin renaissance, and the subsequent flavor explosion is here. At best, Fruit Loop-flavored vodka is the bastardization of a liquor that's supposed to taste like nothing. There's a more sinister explanation, as it's no secret Fruit Loop vodka is more flavor-accessible for young (dare I say underage) drinkers. A similar thing seems to be happening in order to make gin â€” which to some tastes like a Christmas tree and to others like a delicious Christmas tree â€” more accessible. The gin and tonic, once thought of as a more refined and grandfatherly kind of drink, is now de rigueur among what we might derisively call "millennials."Â As people want more gin, we're seeing more gin flavors. Take Hoxton, one of the biggest gin success stories of the past few years. They pump their liquid withÂ grapefruit, juniper, iris, tarragon and ginger. A Hoxton gin and tonic will taste very different than your more classic Beefeater or Bombay Sapphire. There's also coconut gin, saffron gin, and pretty much any other flavor once relegated to vodka. Some gin purists aren't happy, but then again purists never are. As someone who drinks and occasionally writes about alcohol, here's my message: Stop being a gin snob. Stop being an alcohol snob altogether. If you are one, consider not being one. When done correctly, drinking is supposed to be, you know, fun. Don't be annoying about it. Live and let live, different strokes, and other clichÃ©s, just stop. If you don't, you risk making gin the next scotch, long considered a more pretentious beverage choice (a title it shouldn't have, since there are perfectly tasty cheap options).Â  Here's the Free Beacon's Sonny Bunch responding to an article I wroteÂ interviewingÂ a local barkeep who had the audacity to say that people should just drink their scotch however they like â€” ice, soda, water, coke, it's all good. However, for the love of god, if youâ€™re going to pay for that slight upgrade in taste enjoy it andÂ do not drown it in sugary sweet soda. If thatâ€™s how youâ€™re drinking your Johnnie Walker Blue,Â you are doing it wrong. I can ASSURE you of this. ALL CAPS ASSURE. I canÂ ALL CAPS ASSURE YOUÂ that Sonny drinks alone. Don't let this happen to gin, the summertime beverage. Gin and tonic! Martinis! Be happy. It's fine if people want to drink flavored gin. It's fine if people want to drink anything, so long as it's not in a harmful way. This is a silly thing to get mad about. And, for what it's worth, Business Insider had the chance to taste a fantastic "classic" gin called Martin Miller's. We drank it straight, something you usually don't do with gin. It was truly smooth, like a higher-end Beefeater.Â No coconut, no saffron, only a slight hint of cucumber on the finish. So if that's your thing, try drinking Martin Miller's instead of Hoxton, but don't shame the Hoxton-drinkers in the process.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstIf the U.S. didn't want Larry Summers, Israel would have loved to have the former U.S. treasury secretary run its banking system. Unfortunately for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Summers turned him down.  Reuters' Dan Williams cause a minor storm Saturday after he disclosed that Netanyahu offered Summers the Bank of Israel governor job. Summers wasn't necessarily a lock for the position, according to the Jerusalem Post: he still needed approval from the Turkel Committee heading the search. The bank’s acting governor, Karnit Flug, is also in the running.  But calm your fears: Summers reportedly turned the job done, according to Israel’s Channel 2, by way of The Hill. The Times of Israel reports there's a different front runner anyway: Hebrew media speculation has it that the leading candidate for the influential post, in a process that has dragged on for over days, is Professor Zvi Eckstein. Eckstein is the dean of the School of Economics at Herzliya’s Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), and served as the Bank of Israel’s deputy chief between fron 2006-11. Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yair Lapid plan to announce Stanley Fischer's new successor on Sunday. Stanley Fischer, the previous central bank governor, announced his departure earlier this year and left the job in June. It seems Summers is in high demand but can't quite land a steady job. Summers was in the running to succeed Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chair, but he dropped out after some public outcry. The job eventually went to the people's candidate, Janet Yellin, who was Federal Reserve vice chair under Bernanke.
REUTERS/Dylan Martinez WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has reached a tentative $13 billion agreement with theÂ U.S. Justice DepartmentÂ to settle government agency investigations into bad mortgage loans the bank sold to investors before the financial crisis, a source said on Saturday. The tentative deal does not release the bank from criminal liability for some of the mortgages it packaged into bonds and sold to investors, a factor that had been a major sticking point in the discussions, the source said. As part of the deal, the bank will likely cooperate in criminal inquiries into certain individuals involved in the conduct at issue, the source, who declined to be identified, said. Officials at JPMorgan and the Justice Department declined to comment. Another source close to the discussions characterized a deal as likely, but cautioned that parts of the agreement are still being hammered out, and the settlement could conceivably fall apart. The record settlement could help resolve many of the legal troubles the New York bank is facing. Earlier this month JPMorgan disclosed it had stockpiled $23 billion in reserves for settlements and other legal expenses to help cover the myriad investigations into its conduct before and after the financial crisis. The deal is being hammered out by some of the most senior officials at theÂ Department of JusticeÂ and the largest U.S. bank. Attorney GeneralÂ Eric HolderÂ and JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon spoke on the phone on Friday night to finalize the broad outlines of the broad deal, the first source said. The bank's general counsel Stephen Cutler and Associate Attorney GeneralÂ Tony WestÂ are negotiating a statement of facts that will be part of a final agreement, the source said. Long considered one of the best-managed banks, JPMorgan has stumbled in recent years, with run-ins with multiple federal regulators as well as authorities in several states and foreign countries over issues ranging from multibillion-dollar trading losses and poor risk controls to probes into whether it manipulated a power market. In September, as the Justice Department prepared to sue the bank over mortgage securities that the bank sold in the run-up to the financial crisis, JPMorgan tried to reach a broader settlement with DOJ and other federal and state agencies to resolve claims over its mortgage-related liabilities stemming from the bust in house prices. Dimon went to Washington to meet with Holder on September 25, and discussed an $11 billion settlement at that point. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bankÂ Washington MutualÂ and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The bank and the Justice Department have been discussing a broad deal that would resolve not only the inquiry into mortgage bonds it sold to investors between 2005 to 2007 that were backed by subprime and other risky residential mortgages, but also similar lawsuits from theÂ Federal Housing Finance Agency, theÂ National Credit Union Administration, the state of New York and others. The broader settlement is a product of a government working group created nearly two years ago to investigate misconduct in the residential mortgage-backed securities market that contributed to the financial crisis. Officials from the Justice Department, the New York Attorney General and others helped to lead the group. Reuters reported late Friday that JPMorgan and FHFA had reached a tentative $4 billion deal. That agreement is expected to be part of the larger $13 billion settlement.

Google ImagesU.S. energy independence is a myth. Oil is a globally traded commodity, so no matter how much oil and gas emerges from the Great American Shale Boom, the price we pay at the pump will remain dependent on supply and demand in the rest of the world, including the Middle East. As ITG Energy Research Director Judith Dwarkin told us recently:Â  "...the notion that the US is less exposed to disruptions in international crude trade now because it imports less oil reflects a lack of understanding about how the world oil market actually works. The world oil market is a single, integrated market â€“ meaning an oil crisisÂ anywhereÂ is a crisisÂ everywhere. In this world, itâ€™s the sum of demand and the sum of supplies that determines prices. So unless the US decides to control crude prices within its own territory (a truly horrible idea), it isnâ€™t insulated from price shocks related to disruptions in oil trade outside its borders, whatever the reason for the disruptions." But that does not mean the boom has all been for nothing. Here are five ways 'Saudi America' is is reshaping geopolitics. Western sanctions took 1.5 million barrels of Iranian crudeÂ out of the market.Â But as S&amp;P's Peter Rigby told us in June, a large portion of lost Iranian oil was made up for by North American shale production: ...as Iranian supply came off the global market, new US supply was coming on line to contribute to meeting global demand. So even though US supply, for all practical purposes, does not go onto the global market, it contributes to global supplies.Â The price is still global, which the US pays, adjusted, of course, for transportation and crude quality differentials. So, all else being equal, had the embargo gone into effect without that new 1 million barrels per day from the US, there would have been upwards price pressure on crude. One million barrels is not an insignificant amount, as evidenced by the changing crude oil shipping patterns that are emerging. Here is a list of the countries importing the largest quantities of oil products, showing along with what proportion of their consumption that would represent (it's not totally one-to-one as some countries like Panama are transit points): Here's a map showing countries receiving the most overall products: EIA Natural gas exports do not face the same restrictionsÂ as crude, and the U.S. hasÂ approved four new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals since the advent of the shale boomÂ to take product to countries with which we have no free trade agreements.Â And there are a lot of them. An additional 6.27 bcf of gas a day can now be shipped abroad. Ten more terminals are awaiting approval.Â Â  Some analysts say America may lose sight of climate change as a result of its shale production. That's in part because low natural gas prices has sent coal consumption down -12% since 2011 â€” and in the process, reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2010 and 2012, they fell-5% in the U.S., and helped slow global emissions growth to 2%, according to BP data.Â  â€œThis extraordinary rate of [shale] development is good for our country in terms of jobs and energy prices, but bad in that we are not worrying as much about the greenhouse gas problem as we are about exploiting gas with hydrofracking," Penn State geosciences professor Susan Brantley told The Guardian. Fracking did not stop President Obama from instituting new rules for coal plants.Â Plus,Â there's debate about whether, over the long term, natural gas production does impact the climate. But the current numbers are undeniable, and the State Department now has an active program devoted to helping countries promote their own shale industries. Just because the U.S. will always remain as exposed to global oil markets, it doesn't mean countries heavily reliant on oil won't see turmoil.Â In an open letter to the Saudi monarchy earlier this year, billionaire investor Prince Alweed warnedÂ that the country should begin examining how to further diversify its economy should American and Asian shale production start eating into Saudi market share. This week, the country announcedÂ it would begin ramping up its unconventional gas production. The greater danger may actually be to Russia, whose economy heavily depends on elevated natural gas prices. Once the aforementioned U.S. gas exports come on line, those prices will begin to come down. As Southern Methodist University's Bernard Weinstein has written, "...by exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S. to Europe and Asia we can help break Gazpromâ€™s hold on those markets.Â  At the same time, we should continue transferring our fracking technology to China, Poland and other countries with substantial shale resources to diminish their dependence on Russian gas."
REUTERS/Michael Buholzer  Switzerland has a very direct style of democracy. For example, changes to the constitution, or "popular initiatives," can be proposed by members of the public and are voted on if more than 100,000 people sign them. If a majority of voters and cantons (Swiss states) agree, the change can be come law. This system not only allows individual citizens a high degree of control of their laws, but also means that more unorthodox ideas become referendum issues. Recently, there has been a spate of popular initiatives designed to curb inequality in the country. Earlier this year Swiss voters agreed to an idea proposed by entrepreneur Thomas Minder that limited executive (in his words, "fat cat") salaries of companies listed on the Swiss stock market. Next monthÂ voters will decide on the 1:12 Initiative, which aims to limit the salaries of CEOs to 12 timesÂ the salary of their company's lowest paid employee. There's a crazier proposal than this, however. Earlier this month an initiative aimed at giving every Swiss adult a "basic income" that would "ensure a dignified existence and participation in the public life of the whole population" gained enough support to qualify for a referendum. The amount suggested is 2,500 francs ($2,800) a month. While most observers think that the vote is a longshot, it has certainly sparked debate â€” and not just in Switzerland. Writing for USA Today, Duncan Black said that a "minimum income" should be considered for the U.S. "It's pretty clear that the most efficient way to improve the lives of people is to guarantee a minimum income," Black concludes. However, Black understates just how radical the proposal is. We spoke to Daniel Straub, one of the people behind the initiative, to get a better understanding of what the proposal really means, why it is so radical, and what the world could learn from it. Business Insider: Can you tell me a little bit about how the idea came to be? Daniel Straub: A lot of people have proposed this idea. For example Thomas Paine in the United States or also the famous psychologist Erich Fromm has written about it in the sixties. BI: Why choose a minimum income rather than, say, a higher minimum wage?Â  DS: We are not proposing a minimum income â€” we are proposing an unconditional income. A minimum wage reduces freedom â€” because it is an additional rule. It tries to fix a system that has been outdated for a while. It is time to partly disconnect human labor and income. We are living in a time where machines do a lot of the manual labor â€” that is great â€” we should be celebrating. BI: How was the figure of 2,500 Swiss francs settled on? What standard of living does this buy in Switzerland?Â  DS: That depends where in Switzerland you live. On average it is enough for a modest lifestyle.Â  BI: What effect would you expect the minimum income to have on Swiss government expenditure?Â  DS: The unconditional income in Switzerland means that a third of the GDP would be distributed unconditionally. But I don't count that as government expenditure because it is immediately distributed to the people who live in this society. It means less government power because each individual can decide how to spend the money. BI: I've seen people compare it to Milton Friedman's negative income tax, do you think that comparison works?Â  DS: We go a step further than Friedman with the unconditionality. This would lead to a paradigm change. Not the needy get an income from the community but everybody. BI: There have been a variety of initiatives recently that appear to be aimed at limiting inequality in Switzerland, from the 1:12 initiative to Thomas Minder's "against rip-off salaries" referendum. Why do you think this is happening? DS: People seem to be unhappy with the rising inequality. The other initiatives try to put a band-aid on an outdated system. We are proposing a new system. BI: On the surface of it, Switzerland is a good place to live, with a high quality of life, relatively high salaries, and good public services. Why do you need to take these big steps to rearrange society? DS: Switzerland has incredible material resources. But we are not using them in a smart way. A lot of people are stressed and there is a lot of fear. Our resources don't lead to the freedom they could. And I am not saying that this freedom is easy â€” but it could lead to more meaningful lives. If more people start to ask what they really want to do with their lives, Switzerland will become an even more beautiful place to live.Â  BI: Switzerland is a unique country in a lot of ways. Do you think that other countries â€” for example, the U.S. â€” could learn from both its referendum system and the egalitarian initiatives enabled by it? DS: I think that our system of semi direct democracy leads to more involvement by the public â€” that is a good thing. What other effects it would have on a system such as the U.S. I do not dare to predict. (The text has been edited for clarity, and links have been added to help explain Straub's responses.)
Vimeo, screenshotArian Foster, the star running back for the Houston Texans, is now the first athlete to go public. He has sold a 20 percent stake in his future income to Fantex Holdings, a stock market for buying and selling shares in the earnings potential of athletes.Â  It works like this.Â Arian Foster gets a check for $10 million. In exchange, Fantex gets a 20 percent "tax" on all future Arian Foster income. That means if Foster earns more than $50 million starting now, Fantex and its investors stand to make money. If Foster earns less than $50 million, he just signed a sweet deal. Actually, forget if.Â Foster just signed a sweet deal. With just over $20 million left on his current contract ending in 2016, Foster will be 30 when he's up for another contract. For work-horse backs like Foster who carry the ball 300-400 times a season, 30 years old might as well be 90. He will never get another $20 million contract, which means anybody betting in his future is hoping Foster gets on ESPN and slowly works his way toward $50 million over the course of the next few decades. But let's dig deeper. There are at least three sports reasons and three business reasons why Arian Foster is an awful investment for you.Â Here are theÂ sports reasons, moving from the general to the specific. And here are the business reasons, moving similarly from the general to the specific. -- We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.Â  -- We have a very limited operating history ... -- To date, we have not generated any revenues or cash flow from any brand contract... -- We will need to obtain additional funding to acquire additional brands and we may also need additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to obtain the necessary financing, or fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and we may be forced to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations. -- Our principal source of cash flow for the foreseeable future will be derived from our brand contracts.Â  -- We do not have any experience managing brand contracts and we do not have any historical performance data about our brand contracts. Dear lord. In short: We're a young, unproven company losing lots of money, relying on a business that we don't have any experience in andÂ that we cannot predict with any accuracy.Â  3. When you buy a stock of Arian Foster through Fantex, you're not just betting on Foster, the older, proven NFL back. You're betting on Fantex, the young, unproven company losing lots of money, relying on a business that they don't have any experience in andÂ that they cannot predict with any accuracy. Per the prospectus: While we intend for our Fantex Series Arian Foster to track the performance of the brand, we cannot provide any guarantee that the series will in fact track the performance of such brand. Wait, what? So Arian Foster stock isn't really Arian Foster stock?Â Go on... The board of directors has discretion to reattribute assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows without the approval of shareholders of a particular tracking series, which discretion will be exercised in accordance with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law and only where its decisions are in the best interests of the company and the stockholders as a whole. Essentially, the board has the right to dilute your shares if the company's investments turn sour. Felix Salmon translates into even simplerÂ English:Â If Foster fails, investors lose;Â if Fantex fails, investors lose. The upshot here?Â FantexÂ is a fun story. Do notÂ become a character in it. Keep your money in that index fund.
REUTERS/Alessandro BianchiMILAN (Reuters) - A Milan court ruled on Saturday that former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi should be barred from holding public office for two years following a conviction for tax fraud.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  However, since Berlusconi is a senator, the court's decision will have no immediate effect and his expulsion from the Senate will depend on a separate vote in the upper house of parliament, expected to take place next month.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Saturday's ruling reflected the prosecution's request for a two-year ban. Berlusconi's lawyers, who said they would appeal the decision to the supreme court, had asked for a one-year ban, the minimum under the law being applied in the Milan case. The maximum would have been three years.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Italy's supreme court on August 1 definitively upheld a tax fraud conviction against the center-right leader, rejecting his final appeal against an earlier four-year jail sentence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The four-year sentence was commuted to one year, and, if the Senate expels him, Berlusconi, 77, will spend the year either under house arrest or in community service.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the August 1 ruling, the supreme court confirmed the conviction but ordered a further judicial review of a ban on holding public office imposed for the same offence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The upper house's vote next month will effectively supersede the Milan court's decision because it will be based on a separate law, which, if he is expelled, would ban Berlusconi from public office for six years.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Losing his seat in the Senate would deprive Berlusconi, who is fighting a conviction for paying for sex with a minor among other legal cases, of his parliamentary immunity from arrest.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A special Senate committee opened the way earlier this month for a motion to expel Berlusconi.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Senate is dominated by Berlusconi opponents from both the left and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and is expected to vote to strip him of his seat.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The decision over Berlusconi's future has been one of the most sensitive issues facing parliament.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Center-left Prime Minister Enrico Letta's awkward coalition with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party almost fell when Berlusconi pulled his ministers out of the government last month.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The stated reason for the break was a disagreement over tax policy, but the weeks of tension over his impending expulsion helped poison the climate in the broad left-right coalition.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The August supreme court ruling involved inflated invoices at Berlusconi's Mediaset broadcasting empire and was the first definitive sentence he had received after dozens of previous trials on charges ranging from tax to sex offences.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The billionaire has protested his innocence, accusing magistrates of persecuting him since his entry into politics 20 years ago.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (Writing by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alistair Lyon)
