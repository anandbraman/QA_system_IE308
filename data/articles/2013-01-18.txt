YoutubeBack To The Future 2The value of the Japanese dollar is falling again, now that new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to reinflate the country by instructing the country's central bank to make asset purchases. It's now pretty inconceivable that a Japanese company would be able to snap up American corporate assets as investments. ¬† In the eighties, it was a fact of life. Starting with a relative trickle at the beginning of the decade, Japanese conglomerates went on an epic buying spree in America during the latter half of the decade after both countries agreed to revalue their currencies. The trend became so widespread that the "corporate Japanese takeover" concept began leaking into American culture. ¬† Via Google News, we now take you on a tour of this singular moment in the life of both countries...

On January 17th Chinese officials confirmed that, during hostilities between Myanmar's military and rebels from that country's ethnic-Kachin minority, a bomb had landed in Chinese territory. China borders Myanmar, and since fighting between the Burmese military and the Kachin Independence Army flared up again in 2011 events have frequently threatened to draw it further into the conflict. In 2012 around 10,000 people fleeing the violence crossed the border into the Chinese province of Yunnan. The Chinese government does not officially recognise the refugee problem, and has forced some migrants back into Myanmar. However, its attempts to downplay the scale of the security crisis have been tested as the fighting has extended across the porous border. Chinese foreign ministry officials swiftly expressed strong concern and dissatisfaction to the Burmese government over the bomb that landed some 500 metres into Chinese territory. It was not clarified who fired it, but it followed three "bombs" (most likely artillery shells) that landed in China from Myanmar at the end of December. The ministry asked for measures to be taken so that such events could be prevented in future. China meanwhile called on both sides in the violence to implement a ceasefire immediately. The incident poses a quandary for the Chinese government. The Burmese administration, led by the president, Thein Sein, has drawn closer to Western countries such as the US as a result of the country's recent political liberalisation. This has undermined Chinese influence and raised concerns about the status of China's investments in the country. Chinese ties with Myanmar and its military remain strong, but China's authorities do not wish to drive their neighbours any further into the arms of the West. This limits their ability to respond effectively to incursions such as the bomb that landed in their territory. For its part, Myanmar's government can do little to halt the fighting: the Burmese military has already ignored an earlier government call to halt offensives against ethnic rebels. Challenging the military on ethnic issues is dangerous for the government, given that if powerful figures in the military came to view Thein Sein's administration as a threat to national unity, they could take action that would severely set back the country's ongoing political and economic liberalisation.

YouTubeWASHINGTON (AP) ó The Interior Department is again delaying a proposed rule that would require companies drilling for oil and natural gas on federal lands to publicly disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations. The Obama administration first proposed a "fracking" rule last May, with a final rule expected by the end of the year. Officials later revised the timeline to early 2013. On Friday, the department pushed the deadline back again, announcing plans for a second draft version by the end of March, with publication of a final rule not expected until late 2013. Interior Department spokesman Blake Androff said the administration is committed to responsible expansion of domestic oil and gas production, but said it is important that the public have confidence that proper environmental protections are in place.
By:¬† John Browne Friday, January 18, 2013 Over the past two months, Europe‚Äôs problems seem to have disappeared from the headlines. However, the new French Socialist government is pushing ahead with policies that favor significantly higher government spending, greater regulation of business and commerce, and severely higher taxes on high earners. The long term effects of these policies, which I believe will lead to further economic decline, may be given fresh scrutiny if France is drawn into a lasting conflict in West Africa as a result of its surprise intervention in Mali last week. The financial discussions that will certainly accompany a longer term strategic commitment to the region may finally make clear that one of Europe‚Äôs largest economies is heading down a dangerous fiscal path. The pressures on France are coming at a time when internal British politics point towards increasing chances that, for the first time, the people of the United Kingdom will be given a referendum vote on their continued membership in the European Union (EU).¬† France is a partner with Germany in the two-nation Axis which effectively runs the EU. Second only to Germany, the UK is a key provider of funding for the EU. If either France faces an economic bailout or the UK votes to leave, the EU likely will begin to disintegrate. Despite massive central bank support, the euro would threaten collapse and cause panic in many markets. These issues should be looming large on national economies. Instead, investors and the media are focused on some signs of economic recovery in the U.S. Encouraged perhaps by the impact of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs unprecedented quantitative easing policies, which have kept interest rates near all-time lows, consumers have spent more freely in recent months. This, possibly combined with government propaganda and misleading statistics particularly regarding inflation and unemployment, has persuaded corporations to spend more. Automobile sales are up and real estate prices appear to be recovering slightly. This seemingly good news has tabled fears of an imminent crisis. At the same time, and with fantastical schemes like the trillion dollar platinum coin attracting attention, more observers are coming to grip with America‚Äôs intractable financial shortfalls. These concerns appear to outweigh ECB president Mario Draghi‚Äôs promises to create as much synthetic euro currency as is necessary to support the sovereign debt obligations of all Eurozone member nations. As a result, the euro has staged a remarkable ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù rally, gaining 7.5% against the dollar in the second half of 2012. At present the euro currency is nearing a 10 month high.¬† Fearing debasement of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese Yen, the euro has become a de facto second reserve currency. Indeed, the fact that the euro exhibited such strength in 2012, when the future of the Eurozone and even that of the EU was threatened, suggests the global insistence that the euro survive. But the situation in France and the UK may test this resolve. French President Sarkozy was a Europhile. He conducted French policy in lock step support of German initiatives. However, his successor, President Fran√ßois Hollande, is an ardent Socialist. His policies are leading France towards a possible economic disaster on par with those facing Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIGS). Intimating that France was a potentially mortal threat to the EU, the Economist‚Äôs cover for the November 17th - 23rd 2012 issue carried the headline,‚ÄòThe time-bomb at the heart of Europe.‚Äô An open ended commitment to defend France‚Äôs former West African colonies against Islamist incursions from the Sahara could fast track a fiscal crisis. Whereas the economies of most of the PIGS were small enough to be bailed out, France has the world‚Äôs sixth largest economy. It is far too big for a bailout without threatening the economies of Germany and the UK. The UK is a major funding source for the EU, second only to Germany. However, despite the fact that the UK is not a member of the Eurozone, the recent Eurozone banking bailouts have involved payments by British citizens via membership of the ECB and the IMF. Naturally this has proved very unpopular. Today, anti-EU feeling is running high. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) under Nigel Farage, its dynamic leader, now has taken over from the Liberals as the third political party in the UK. Indeed, it looks set to be the first UK party in the next European elections with a platform offering the UK‚Äôs withdrawal from the EU. So while the problems of Europe appear to be contained, under the surface the problems are getting more dire by the day.

Mal B / FlickrChina released Q4 2012 GDP figures last night, and the numbers came in slightly above economists' estimates, re-accelerating to 7.9 percent growth year-over-year from 7.4 percent in the previous quarter. The numbers may distance the Chinese economy from the feared "hard landing scenario" a bit. However, China's fate depends very much on that of the global economy over the coming year ñ and a big shock in one of the world's major economies could revive fears of a hard landing once again. China's fragile shadow banking system is also still a major concern. Guy Stear and Wei Yao of SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale put together an excellent presentation examining how a China hard landing could come about and the impact it would have on a range of asset classes, as well as clients' views on the hard landing scenario.

BoeingBoeing has halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner pending FAA approval, Bloomberg News reported via Twitter. As of Thursday, the plane manufacturer had not slowed slowed production of its new passenger jet, but would not discuss plans for deliveries since the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive, effectively grounding the worldwide fleet of 787s. According to the AP, production will continue during the FAA review. Deliveries are suspended until the FAA approves a solution. A Boeing spokesperson said, "We will not deliver 787s until the FAA approves a means of compliance with their recent Airworthiness Directive concerning batteries and the approved approach has been implemented," according to the Agence France Presse. To date, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners. It has taken orders for hundreds more, which it plans to produce and deliver over the next several years. It produces about five 787s per month. Here's Bloomberg's tweet: FLASH: Boeing says 787 Dreamliner deliveries halted pending FAA approval

APByron York at the Washington Examiner was way ahead on the House Republicans' new plan to make the debt ceiling contingent on a Senate budget resolution.† As York reported Monday, the idea of tying the debt ceiling to a Senate budget resolution is actually the brainchild of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and the GOP's leading critic over Senate Democrats' failure to pass a budget.† As York points out, there's virtually no incentive for Democrats to make a new budget. The last time Congress passed a budget was in April 2009, when Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives and a supermajority in the Senate. As a result, that budget was loaded with Democratic spending priorities.† The House has passed the Paul Ryan budget plan, a non-starter in the Senate. Rather than come up with their own new spending plan, however, Senate Democrats simply kept the government funded with continuing resolutions, based on the last budget passed by Congress. Senate Democrats claim that there is no point in passing a budget resolution because they wouldn't have the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster.† But that claim is only half true. There are special rules for Senate budget resolutions, including a debate time limit, so it actually is possible to pass a budget with a simple majority. But the Senate budget doesn't actually go into effect until the Senate passes another Senate Resolution, which can be filibustered. So without 60 votes, the budget resolution would be a hollow gesture.† Congress tried to resolve this problem during the last debt ceiling fight by creating a supercommittee to reach a budget agreement. Obviously, we know how that turned out. As polling has shown, Republicans are bearing the brunt of the blame for Washington's budget gridlock. The new debt ceiling plan ó which would raise the debt ceiling for three months, but make a long-term increase contingent on a Senate budget ó gives House Republicans a chance to the turn the tables.†Rather than focus on spending cuts ó a message that has so far failed miserably ó they are †trying to shift the onus to President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.† It's not a HUGE win for the GOP if the Democrats go along with this, but it at least puts some attention on the Democrats' spending plans, and that's better than nothing. It's unclear if this gambit will work; despite the short-term concession, Republicans are still trying to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to push through spending cuts. But at least they are ready to play offense.†

 With today's news that the GOP is looking for a face-saving way to capitulate on the debt ceiling, the US is now *this close* to exiting the age of crisis. There are still a couple of humps including, well, the actual debt ceiling vote itself, and the sequester (which is the introduction of premature austerity), and the potential government shutdown. But the bigger picture is that the economy is healing, Europe is no longer in acute crisis, and China is rebounding. There are still risks, but the era of crisis 2007-2012 is just about in the books. Really driving things home is a new post from Bill McBride titled The Future's So Bright... McBride was the original crisis/economics blogger, and when he writes stuff like the following, you pay attention: It looks like economic growth will pickup over the next few years. I've written about this before - a combination of growth in the key housing sector, a significant amount of household deleveraging behind us, the end of the drag from state and local government layoffs (four years of austerity nearing the end), some loosening of household credit, and the Fed staying accommodative (with a 7.8% unemployment rate and inflation below the Fed's target, the Fed will remain accommodative). Joe LaVorgna at Deutsche Bank made a similar call today, saying that finally the great deleveraging had come to an end. Goldman has also said the crisis ends this year. We don't want to jinx things, so we'll make the official call in a little bit, but we're close. Now go read Bill McBride's full post here &gt;
After Morgan Stanley's Q4 earnings report beat expectations this morning, CEO James Gorman sat down with Bloomberg TV's Erik Schatzker to answer the question that's been on everyone's mind ó is the bloodletting at Morgan Stanley over? Since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley has been one of the most aggressive Wall Street banks in terms of cutting costs thorugh layoffs and compensation cuts. Last year the bank cut 4200 employees, this year already it has let go of 1600. And while the bank did beat analyst expectations of $0.27 with reported profits of $0.45 a share, there is a caveat to that. The beat is ex an accounting charge called debt valuation adjustment (DVA), which places a value on a company's debt. Including DVA, Morgan Stanley's profits hit $0.25 a share. So Schatzker got down to brass tacks ó does that matter? Does it mean there will be more carnage at the bank? Is it over? Here's Gorman's response (from Bloomberg TV): "We are very comfortable with the headcount we have right now. These have been tough decisions. No one enjoys going through a restructuring the kind we have been through and other firms on the Street have been going through. Every day, it is a different financial institution. We are down 6000 people from 12 1/2 months ago. It is pretty incredible. That's now built into our run rate of expenses. We feel very comfortable with where we are now. The run rate is now lower as a result of those people coming out." Then there's the other cost cutting measure Gorman has employed, cutting or deferring compensation. This week, Reuters reported that any employees making $350,000 with a bonus of more than $50,000 (except for wealth managers) would have all of their bonus deferred. So naturally, Gorman had to address that as well: "Firstly, it's important to note that over 80% of our employees had no deferrals at all. Honestly, that really matters. The folks that were earning obviously lower in the organization, getting the cash so they can manage their personal finances is very important to us. The senior management had 100% of deferrals, but that money gets paid out over the next six months, 12 monthsÖIt aligns our risk profile with our activities so that we have a proper alignment between our interest, our shareholders interest and our employee interest. It reflects the environment we have been operating in." Gorman also touched on Morgan Stanley's fixed income business and his optimistic view of the global economy in general.

The Market Rally Is Based On Four Dubious Assumptions (Comstock Partners) Despite the problems to the U.S. economy, weak global growth, and dysfunctional politics stocks continue to rally on four assumptions. First, markets can't go down as global central banks continue to ease. Second, markets didn't take a huge hit over previous political threats, and they shouldn't this time either. Third, "S&amp;P 500 earnings will rise to $108 in 2013, resulting in a current P/E multiple of only 13.7." Fourth, the economic recovery will resume once problems in Washington are solved or kicked down the road. "The cyclical bull market is now almost four years old and is close to the historical average in terms of both amplitude and duration.¬† At this point it is out of sync with economic growth and valuation, and the risks seem far greater than the potential rewards."

There‚Äôs elasticity in mining companies‚Äô profit margins, he told us, but not in the demand for the underlying commodities they produce. For that reason, large, undeveloped, low grade copper deposits will need to be put into production, sooner than later."
One of the clearest signs yet that debt ceiling fears have faded from the market is the recent shift in the yield curve for short-term U.S. Treasury bills. At this point, it looks like the Republican party has completely backed down from the debt ceiling fight.†Today they offered a three-month extension of the ceiling in exchange for a pledge from Senate Democrats to pass a budget ñ which they haven't done in a while. The chart below shows two 3-month T-bill curves. The curve plots different maturities on the x-axis against yields on the y-axis.†One would expect a typical curve to slope upward ñ as the future is uncertain, and the probability of default sometime in the distant future is necessarily greater than that in the near term. However, there has been an unusual development in the T-bill market as of late. A "hump" has emerged at the front of the curve, causing it to slope downward instead of upward. That's the blue line, which shows the shape of the curve on January 15. Earlier this week, the "hump" at the front of the curve suggested that traders were concerned about the possibility of default on short-term debt, causing the yields on bills maturing around 2/28/13 and 3/7/13 to rise above those maturing 2/21/13. Today, the hump disappeared, and the curve ñ shown in red ñ normalized mostly. Bloomberg, Business Insider The implication is that traders are no longer expressing elevated concerns of a default around March 1, when the debt ceiling battle was supposed to culminate before the Republican party agreed to the latest deal. The curve is still slightly inverted at the front today, but that's mostly just noise, a bond trader tells us. Nonetheless, the normalization to a more upward-sloping curve suggests that things are back to normal, and traders aren't so concerned anymore. (h/t @fullcarry)
Bloomberg via YouTubeTremendous amounts of borrowing (i.e. leveraging) juiced the economy during the credit bubble. But when that bubble burst, households retrenched their finances by cutting back on all of that debt (i.e. they delevered). In a new note to clients, Deutsche Bank economist Joe LaVorgna argues that this economically painful deleveraging process is almost complete. Assuming perpetual nominal GDP growth of 4.5%, which is only slightly higher than the 4.3% gain registered over the four quarters ending Q3 2012, and assuming steady liabilities, which actually continue to fall modestly, means that household debt to disposable income will be back at long-term equilibrium by Q2 2014.¬† Of course, nominal GDP growth could turn out to be faster, especially once the budgetary noise from Washington dissipates. A 5% rate of nominal GDP would put us at equilibrium one quarter earlier. Furthermore, LaVorgna believes this final leg of deleveraging will be smooth sailing, relatively speaking. ...we highly doubt the last one sixth of the deleveraging process by US households will be as painful as the preceding five-sixths of the process, over which time outright debt actually fell. Much of the decline was due to bankruptcies and mortgage foreclosures. Thus, the headwind for further deleveraging should be de minimis at this point in the business cycle. This is all good news. "Eventually, we expect households to re- leverage, which would act as a tailwind to economic activity," he writes.¬† "Conceivably, we could even be in the very early stages of a re-leveraging cycle based on the fact that private consumer credit is no longer falling. Here's the chart: Deutsche Bank
APHouse Republicans have come out of their annual retreat in Williamsburg, Va., with a new strategy on debt-ceiling negotiations: They will raise the nation's borrowing limit for three months next week to give Senate Democrats the opportunity to pass a budget. A longer-term extension in the debt ceiling would then be contingent on the Senate passing a budget ó something it hasn't done in almost four years.† Here's Majority Leader Eric Cantor's full statement: "The first step to fixing this problem is to pass a budget that reduces spending. The House has done so, and will again. The Democratic Senate has not passed a budget in almost four years, which is unfair to hardworking taxpayers who expect more from their representatives. That ends this year.†"We must pay our bills and responsibly budget for our future. Next week, we will authorize a three month temporary debt limit increase to give the Senate and House time to pass a budget. Furthermore, if the Senate or House fails to pass a budget in that time, Members of Congress will not be paid by the American people for failing to do their job. No budget, no pay.†"This is the first step to get on the right track, reduce our deficit and get focused on creating better living conditions for our families and children. It's time to come together and get to work." Though the plan appears to have rank-and-file support from Cantor, House Speaker John Boehner and others, it remains to be seen how House Republicans will react to it. Boehner added his support in a statement: ìBefore there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending. The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a budget for four years. That is a shameful run that needs to end, this year.† Both Boehner and Cantor threatened that if the Senate did not pass a budget, members of Congress would not be paid, adopting a "No Budget, No Pay" slogan. Senate Democrats haven't passed a budget resolution in almost four years, a common Republican gripe. Instead, Congress has passed a series of short-term spending plans. The Senate is not in session this week, and it's not yet clear how its members will proceed. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement that it was "reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage." "If the House can pass a clean debt ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it," Reid said.  "As President Obama has said, this issue is too important to middle class families' economic security to use as a ploy for collecting a ransom. We have an obligation to pay the bills we have already incurred - bills for which many House Republicans voted." Talking Points Memo's Brian Beutler explained last year†how Republican complaints are more political gamesmanship than gripes about anything that could affect actual policy. He wrote that budget resolutions are not enforced by law, and that Congress has worked together instead to pass short-term spending plans like the deals that resulted from the last debt-ceiling fight and from the fiscal cliff. Here's how House Whip Steny Hoyer explained it to Beutler: "What does the budget do? The budget does one thing and really only one thing. It sets the parameters of spending and discretionary caps. Other than that, the Appropriations Committee is not bound by the Budget Committeeís priorities. ... The fact is that you donít need a budget. We can adopt appropriation bills and we can adopt authorization policies without a budget." Two examples of that are the Budget Control Act of 2011 ó which led to the fiscal cliff ó and the American Taxpayer Relief Act, the bill that just passed as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama in the beginning of January. These laws†set binding appropriations caps that control spending for up to a decade. Rep.†Paul Ryan†said Thursday that Republicans were discussing a†possible short-term increase in the nation's borrowing limit. A debt-ceiling hike to April 15 ó Tax Day ó would set up some appropriate symbolism for the next potential budget fight. UPDATE:†The White House issued a statement Friday afternoon indicating that Obama would be receptive to a clean debt-ceiling hike: "The President has made clear that Congress has only two options: pay the bills they have racked up, or fail to do so and put our nation into default. We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education and programs middle class families depend on. Congress must pay its bills and pass a clean debt limit increase without further delay. And as he has said, the President remains committed to further reducing the deficit in a balanced way."

flickr.com/photos/tom1231/A house aide on the GOP side (rank and file) explains three things that could happen now that the GOP has offered a 3-month hike on the debt ceiling. Some of the scenarios are not pretty: 1. Dems decide to make their stand here and refuse to pass anything that is short term or tied to the requirement for the Senate to pass a budget.¬† If this happens, things get ugly fast.¬† You get the same war all over again and Republicans will likely feel more righteous about their resistance given the Dems unwillingness to take on what (the GOP sees as) very moderate reforms.¬† 2.¬† Dems agree to pass a budget and the three month extension kick the debt ceiling to around June.¬† That means the hard line anti-spending guys can make their stand on both the CR in March and all the FY14 appropriations bills between now and June.¬† That should function as a great pressure release valve for leadership to force through what will likely be a less-than-palatable long-term debt ceiling extension.¬† 3. We get a short term, but without the budget reform or the Senate never actually passes a budget.¬† CR becomes extra contentious, approps bills turn into the same type of go around as HR 1 and then the debt ceiling arrives with a unified, very angry right wing of the party. Back to¬† things getting ugly, only worse. He concludes: At the end of the day, I can never conceive of an actual default.¬† But an eleventh hour deal (who knows, maybe up to and including a deal at 9:29 on the morning the debt payment is due) is not hard to imagine under options 1 and 3 above.¬† For more on the GOP's offer, and analysts' reaction, see here &gt;
If you are good at math, you‚Äôll be successful on Wall Street. So the saying goes. But how then does one account for people like me? A music major that never set foot in a finance class in college and becomes an Institutional Investor double-ranked analyst? I wasn‚Äôt a dimwit, mind you. I scored reasonably well on my college entrance exams, and graduated summa cum laude from university. But, my success clearly hasn‚Äôt hinged on my logical-mathematical acumen. ¬† According to Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner‚Äôs ground-breaking theory there are at least eight different types of intelligence. The first two aptitudes, logical-mathematical and linguistic, are the most valued by our society; the others‚Äî including kinesthetic, interpersonal, musical, searchlight, spatial, and existential intelligence‚Äî are less so. Mathematical intelligence involves the ability to calculate numbers. Linguistic intelligence means being adept in written and spoken language. These are the two intelligences measured by most schools and standardized tests, and on Wall Street are ‚Äúpay-to-play skills,‚Äù a hurdle you have to jump to be able to do the job, and are thus vital at the outset of a career. Early in my professional life, for example, it was apparent that if I wanted to play in the Wall Street sandbox, I had to pay by learning financial analysis, coursework not covered by my bachelor of arts in music. I also had to significantly improve my writing skills, to be able to persuasively communicate a "buy" or "sell" opinion on a stock. But these pay-to-play intelligences are not what catapulted me to the top of the Wall Street heap. There were plenty of people who could calculate and communicate as well if not better than me. What propelled me were the intelligences that many might consider non-essential, and even dismiss. Musical intelligence, for example, isn‚Äôt just about playing an instrument, or learning a new language, though speaking a foreign language did come in handy working in the emerging markets. Musical intelligence is also about the principles of organization, whether a presentation, conference or event. Many of my clients and colleagues remember well a trip I organized to visit Ing. Carlos Slim. A conversation in his private library about his favorite books gave investors insight into what motivates one of the world‚Äôs billionaires, and the controlling shareholder of America Movil, one of the stocks I covered. I also draw on searchlight intelligence, an intelligence that readily discerns connections across spheres and opportunities to cross-pollinate. One of the key methods of analysis used by security analysts is the mosaic theory that involves collecting public, non-public, and non-material information to determine the value of a company‚Äôs securities, and then to make a stock call. My searchlight intelligence, no doubt, has helped in becoming a well-regarded stockpicker. I have also relied on interpersonal intelligence: the ability to look outward at the behavior and feelings of others, figuring out their motivations. Whether publicly traded or privately-held companies, I spend a lot of time analyzing the personalities of the controlling shareholders and senior management of the companies. One of my best stock calls of moving from a sell to a buy has been due, in part, to making a determination about the personal motivations of a controlling shareholder. Perhaps most important is intrapersonal intelligence, or the ability to identify personal feelings, goals, fears, strengths and weaknesses. I have blind spots, like everyone does, and so very many failings, but the willingness to look at myself, and to doggedly improve, and to make just one more call, to write one more piece, has helped me to become a high-performer.¬†¬† ¬† Perhaps you, like me, are not notably intelligent in the traditional, academically, testable sense. But each of us is intelligent. And as we learn from the theory of disruption, success in your chosen field isn‚Äôt just about figuring out what you do well, but what you do well that others don‚Äôt. So whatever your discipline, do what‚Äôs necessary to clear the pay-to-play intelligence hurdle. But then, focus on your distinctive strengths. What you do outstandingly well. If the marketplace doesn‚Äôt recognize or value this particular intelligence initially, even better ‚Äî that will become your competitive edge. In Wall Street parlance, that edge is what turns stocks ‚Äì and people ‚Äì into a table-pounding "buy."

Wikimedia COmmonsEurasia Group analyst Sean West comments on the news that the GOP is willing to offer a 3-month debt ceiling hike in exchange for the Senate passing a budget: This seems like unilateral disarmament on the debt ceiling in the short-term on [the] behalf [of] the GOP. Democrats aren't going to like it and the next few weeks will be noisy. But I suspect the debt limit gets pushed out beyond the sequester and the continuing resolution, and those become the real fights. This seems to be the market's read as well. Volatility is collapsing. The writing's been on the wall that the GOP would likely fold on the debt ceiling. Outside pressure is coming from all kinds of conservatives (the Koch brothers, Charles Krauthammer, Newt, etc.) who are saying that the debt ceiling is not the place to take a stand on this issue. Meanwhile, even Larry Kudlow is using the word "retreat." 3-month debt extension from #GOP retreat is ok. But still not hearing commitment to implement $1.2 trillion spending sequester.#tcot Greg Sargent at The Washington Post, who has been early in predicting that the GOP would not go to the mat on the debt ceiling, explains the significance of today's move. On the debt ceiling, at least, this is a complete cave. As noted below, the mere willingness to raise the debt ceiling temporarily was itself an acknowledgment by Republicans that the threat of default gave them no leverage and that they had essentially lost this fight. Now the three month extension means that in practical terms, itís essentially been removed from the talks entirely. The reason it's been removed from the talks entirely is that before that three months is up there's going to be a sequester and a budget shutdown fight. So those are where the battles will be: the Continuing Resolution and the sequester.
Headlines about the GOP agreeing to increase the debt ceiling for three months are causing a collapse in fear. The VIX (an options based index that measures traders inclination to hedge against market downside) is collapsing. This means traders are buying less and less plunge protection. And as one trader we know just IMd: "guys scrambling for upside protection now." Here's an intraday look at the VIX via Bloomberg. Bloomberg

Bloomberg via YouTubeMichelle Meyer, US EconomistBank of America economists Chris Flanagan and Michelle Meyer have revised their home price forecasts for 2012 and 2013. They now expect home prices to rise 6.4 percent in 2012, from a previous estimate of 5 percent; and 4.7 percent in 2013, from a previous call for 3 percent growth. Three main factors are behind their upward revision: greater momentum, continued decline in inventory, and greater credit availability. Momentum Previous projections drew on expectations that prices would decline as distressed sales increased and the economy weakened. This turned out not to be true. "Momentum is very important for predicting home prices. Expectations for future prices are a function of current prices. The faster home prices turn, the more people believe they will continue to gain. This is particularly true at this early stage in the cycle, when potential homebuyers are trying to time the bottom in the market. Survey measures suggest confidence in the housing market has improved, albeit from low levels." Depleted inventory Inventories have continued to fall, and Flanagan and Meyer say that at the current sales pace, it will only take 4.8 months to return the stock of homes on the market to a normal pace. The few sources of inventory have been construction, distressed properties, and housing turnover (ratio of existing home sales to existing stock). In terms of construction they see no proof that "builders have been too aggressive". Distressed properties also continue to clear up, though slowly. In coming years however investors who bought distressed properties for bank-owned-to-rental purposes are expected to add to inventory. Credit availability Recent mortgage policy and servicing announcements could boost credit and add momentum for home prices. Developments like qualified mortgage (QM) by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that can help lenders avoid litigation for instance should encourage them to make more loans. Under the rule, borrowers with monthly debt payments that exceed 43 percent of their income won't be considered for a qualified mortgage. In the case of prime quality borrowers if lenders don't engage in risky loan behavior like interest only loans, negative amortization etc they can avoid any litigation from borrowers. They also argue that the recent settlement of 10 mortgage servicers with regulators (which has been criticized by many) should help servicers direct more of their resources to creating a "broader framework allowing eligible borrowers to receive compensation significantly more quickly."

Google FinanceAfter spending much of the morning down, stocks are making a comeback. Moments ago, House Republicans announced that they would vot for a three-month debt ceiling hike next week. A longer-term extension in the debt ceiling would then be contingent on the Senate passing a budget.  "The first step to fixing this problem is to pass a budget that reduces spending," wrote Eric Cantor in a statement.¬† "The House has done so, and will again. The Democratic Senate has not passed a budget in almost four years, which is unfair to hardworking taxpayers who expect more from their representatives. That ends this year."

Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate It's hard to believe that Karl Lagerfeld would have a hard time selling his unused Gramercy Park pied-√†-terre, but it took two years and a $2 million price chop for the famed Chanel designer to unload his 2,200-square-foot pad at 50 Gramercy Park North. He's finally sold it to Macquarie banker Sebastian Barrack for $4.5 million, far less than its initial $6.5 million asking price, The New York Post reports. Lagerfeld purchased the stark white, three-bedroom apartment in 2006 for $6.575 million. Rumor has it he never even actually moved in. Unfortunately for Barrack, the apartment gets poor natural light and has a high maintenance fee. But it does come with a coveted key to Gramercy Park.
At this point, most people agree that the U.S. housing market is recovering. However, there continues to be one less-than-stellar metric of the housing market: new home sales. The explanation for this is pretty intuitive.¬† The economy is still anemic, and steep discounts are driving buyers to older existing homes. Meanwhile, the homebuilders are increasingly optimistic and housing starts have been on the rise.¬† This has some economists worried that a supply glut is building in the market for new homes. Next Friday, we'll get the latest reading of new home sales.¬† Economists expect a healthy jump, which should help with this disconnect in the market. Here's TD Securities with some commentary: The new homes market has been a laggard in the overall housing market recovery, and while new homebuilding and existing home sales activity have risen significantly from their lows, new home sales have yet to enjoy a similar turnaround in fortune. In December, we expect sales activity to improve only modestly, with the pace of sales boasting a respectable 6.1% m/m gain to 400K. The increase in sales will add to the positive momentum in November, when sales rose an equally impressive 4.4% m/m, justifying the surge in optimism among homebuilders (as seen in the NAHB homebuilders‚Äô sentiment report) about sales prospects in recent months. In the coming months, we expect the positive momentum in new home sales activity to be sustained, though it is likely to continue to lag the buoyancy in the existing homes market. Here's TD's chart. Hopefully, the increasing homebuyer traffic will eventually lead to a pick up in sales. TD Securities
The Lance Armstrong doping scandal has toppled the athlete at the top. And now the attention is turning to the money-man at the top‚Äîthe legendary San Francisco-based investment banker Thomas Weisel, who founded and sold Montgomery Securities and Thomas Weisel Partners. Weisel bankrolled the cycling team that Lance Armstrong rode for. And Weisel was on hand for every one of Lance Armstrong's seven Tour victories. Weisel is named as a defendant in the "whistleblower" lawsuit brought by Armstrong's former teammate Floyd Landis, who was himself busted for doping and stripped of a Tour title. Weisel has denied having any knowledge of the team's doping, and he removed a collection of Lance Armstrong's yellow jerseys from his office after the USADA brought its charges against Armstrong. But now, reports Susanne Craig at DealBook, Armstrong may blow the whistle on Weisel, in hopes of¬† persuading sports regulators to allow him to compete again: Since October, when the anti-doping report was issued, Mr. Weisel has found himself in the middle of a media storm. The report did not name Mr. Weisel, but did say that a ‚Äúsmall army of enablers, including doping doctors, drug smugglers, and others within and outside the sport and on his team‚Äù helped Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong, in hopes of mitigating his lifetime ban from Olympic sports, might implicate Mr. Weisel and other team owners, according to people briefed on the case. So far, Mr. Weisel said, neither Mr. Armstrong nor any rider on the team has said that he discussed doping with Mr. Weisel or that he witnessed Mr. Weisel participate in or observe any act of doping. For Lance Armstrong to sell out a team-mate as a way of furthering his own aims won't come as a surprise to those who have watched his behavior in recent years. But it won't help Thom Weisel much, either. SEE ALSO: Here's My Verdict On The Lance Armstrong Interview

On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs upped the ante on its call that 2013 will mark the end of a long-running bull market in gold by introducing a new forecast: the bank's commodity strategists see the shiny yellow metal falling to $1200 per ounce by 2018. However, despite having a bearish 5-year forecast for gold prices, Goldman's 3-month forecast is actually quite bullish. In fact, strategists¬†Damien Courvalin and Alec Phillips write in a note to clients today that they expect gold to reach $1825 per ounce over the next few months ‚Äì up from current prices around $1690 ‚Äì as the debt ceiling debate drags on in the United States. "As a result, with gold prices up only modestly over the past week, we see current prices as being a good entry point to re-establish fresh longs in the gold market before the run up to the debt ceiling debate," Courvalin and Phillips write. The strategists use a number of charts to illustrate their thesis. The first shows how gold prices ran up in 2011, when Congress faced the same debate about raising the debt ceiling:  However, given a number of global macroeconomic factors adding to uncertainty at the time, Courvalin and Phillips concede that the debt ceiling debate itself did not contribute all $150 to the run-up in prices during that episode. Still, the two point out that there have been six debt ceiling debates in recent memory ‚Äì and during three of those debates, gold rose 10 percent:  The Goldman strategists write: There were six instances between 1996 and 2007 when the debt limit was reached and the Treasury resorted to using ‚Äúextraordinary measures‚Äù. For half of these, gold prices rallied by c.10% in the month leading to the increase of the debt limit, a similar magnitude to that in 2011 (Exhibit 6). Finally, there is only one precedent that we are aware of, in July 1957, when the Treasury exhausted its borrowing authority and was¬†forced to delay scheduled payments. Contemporary observers cited failure to make payments to government contractors as a contributing factor in pushing the US economy into recession. The impact was exacerbated by the fact that the debt limit actually declined as it had only been temporarily raised for a year back in July 1956 (temporary increases in the debt limit were the norm until the 1980s). And while gold prices did not trade at the time, the subsequent 15% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average suggests a potential significant move in gold prices. It's unclear what the impact on gold will be this time around, but it even has the bearish-gold types over at Goldman hopeful for a short-term boost.
Thomas WeiselThe drama surrounding Lance Armstrong has cast a harsh spotlight on a man who was one of his biggest supporters: Thomas Weisel, co-owner of the disgraced cyclist's U.S. Postal Service Team. Weisel, who's known on Wall Street for advising Yahoo and other tech giants, says he only recently learned Armstrong doped while riding for the USPS Team, The New York Times reported last night. "Any allegation that I was aware of or condoned or supported doping by any team rider is false," Weisel said. A whistleblower suit filed by Armstrong's USPS teammate Floyd Landis alleges Weisel's connections helped make it possible for the entire team to dope while taking sponsorship money from the government. That suit is currently under seal but was leaked yesterday a few hours before Armstrong's big confession to Oprah Winfrey aired on primetime television. Landis' suit suggests Weisel had enormous financial influence over the U.S. Cycling Federation, the nation's governing body for cycling. When U.S. Cycling's parent company USA Cycling was having financial problems, it was Weisel who stepped in to reorganize it, according to the suit, which cites Weisel's biography "Capital Instincts." Weisel set up a nonprofit called the USA Cycling Development Foundation, which gave between $500,000 and $725,000 a year to USA Cycling between 2000 and 2003, the suit alleges, citing IRS tax forms. From 2002 to 2008, Jim Ochowicz served as president of the board of USA Cycling while also working as a broker at Weisel's investment bank, Landis says. The suit adds: "Mr. Landis is informed and believes that these conflicts of interest and overlapping relationships between USA Cycling, the USA Cycling Foundation, and Thomas Weisel helped make it possible for the USPS Team to carry on the extensive program of systematically doping team athletes during the period relevant to this complaint." The suit went on to add that based on the level of control Weisel had over the team, he was "knowledgeable about, and approved of, the doping program involving the USPS Team." Weisel says he's cooperating with federal authorities and upset by the allegations. "I am as dismayed as everyone else to see a sport that I love and have supported scandalized by this inexcusable behavior," he told The New York Times. Business Insider was not able to immediately reach a representative of Weisel for comment.
YoutubeIf you ever wondered what industry is the American' economy's most accurate bellwether, here's some pretty good evidence that it might be trucking. In the just-released minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's December 11, 2007 meeting, then-St. Louis Fed Governor William Poole recounted what he was hearing from his nonfinancial business contacts about orders and sales. Most reported softening activity, but nothing dire. But not Poole's trucker. From the December 2007 transcript: UPS is expecting a peak season that is milder than in the previous years; my contact believes that the economy is not going into a negative but is clearly slowing down. The company is leasing eleven fewer aircraft this year. To meet the peak, they always lease extra planes for shipping. They are probably holding about steady on capital outlays. My contact at FedEx says that the outlook is very soft, not much buildup toward the holiday peak. The retailers that they talked to are anticipating a softer season, not an absolute decline, but slow growth. International business remains very strong. This company is reducing capital expenditures by 10 percent from its previous expectation. My contact in a major company in the trucking industry says that we are in a recession, the worst he has seen in twenty to forty years. The company is reducing its fleet size by 10 percent, is cutting capital spending quite substantially, and has no good news. This all the more incredible given the NBER later determined December 2007 was the month when the Great Recession began. SEE MORE:¬†The Story Of Japan's 1980s American Invasion &gt;
International hacking group Anonymous has taken over INDEC, Argentina's Bureau of Statistics, Urgente24 reports.†Authorities have yet to reclaim the site since the group announced the hacking over Twitter yesterday. Argentina has come under intense international pressure for INDEC's inflation statistics. Last month, the International Monetary Fund met to discuss whether or not the country should be penalized for refusing to reform a system that has lead to fines and jail time for statisticians who insist official government numbers are too low. In September, IMF Christine Lagarde said the country may need to be "red carded."†To which Argentina's President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner replied that her country would "accept no threats or pressure" from the IMF. The IMF is set to decide Argentina's fate at the end of the month. On Monday, INDEC announced Argentine inflation for 2012 at 18.4%. Independant analysts put it at 25.6%. Meanwhile, obviously, Anonymous is getting its message across. "AsÌ responde el pueblo a sus mentiras NADIE vive con $5,50" ó This is how the people respond to your lies. No one lives on $5.50," the group said in a tweet (according to Urgente24). In the Tweet below, they say that they will cede control of the website when the Argentine government stops lying.

Drn/Getty ImagesMyanmar is accepting bids for 18 onshore oil blocks in its second, according to UPI.com.¬† Myanmar is said to have anywhere from 11 trillion - 23 trillion cubic feet in natural gas reserves.¬†It is also said to have 50 million barrels of crude oil reserves, according to the EIA. This creates a huge investment opportunity for energy giants to tap into the resource rich nation. Myanmar was isolated from the west for a long time. While Asian companies from China and India tapped into its resources, western companies were prevented from doing so until sanctions against the country started being lifted in the first half 2012.  By June it was reported that General Electric and Chevron were pushing to get a license by the end of 2012. And their eagerness was understood. Chevron for instance has held a controversial stake in Yadan gas field and a natural pipeline but couldn't expand its operations because of U.S. sanctions.¬† Interested companies can bid for three blocks but have to partner with the State owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) or one other state-owned enterprise. Western companies have been wary of partnering with MOGE, which is still said to have close ties with the former regime that reportedly made secret arrangements to "sell gas to China and Thailand, and is associated with the controversial Chinese pipelines being built through Burma to China," according to The Irrawaddy. MOGE was blamed for the Ministry of Energy's decision to postpone the auction of new offshore blocks in September last year. Companies have two months to make a bid. The sites being auctioned account for a third of Myanmar's 50 onshore blocks.  SEE ALSO: Mark Mobius Says 2 Things Need To Happen Before Investors Can Flood Into Myanmar &gt;
APRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, who said two weeks ago that a government shutdown "might be necessary" as a step to curb federal spending, said in an interview published Friday that Congress "will raise the debt ceiling." "We will raise the debt ceiling. We're not going to default on our debt," Cornyn told The Houston Chronicle's editorial board. He added, firmly, that "we're not going to default." Cornyn joins a growing list of conservatives that appear to be backing off on a potential debt-ceiling fight, arguing that the risk of default is not worth it. Rep. Paul Ryan said Thursday that Republicans are discussing a possible short-term increase in the nation's borrowing limit. Cornyn told the Chronicle that prioritization of payments in the event the U.S. breaches the debt ceiling could work, "but my hope would be that we would not even go there." Two weeks ago,†Cornyn wrote in a Houston Chronicle op-ed that it was†"unacceptable" that Obama has said he won't negotiate over the debt ceiling:† [Obama] has already signaled an unwillingness to negotiate over the debt ceiling. This is unacceptable. The president should immediately put forward a plan that addresses these deadlines, and he should launch serious, transparent budget negotiations. The biggest fiscal problem in Washington is excessive spending, not insufficient taxation. Tax cuts didn't cause this problem, so tax increases won't solve it. If we don't reduce spending and reform our three biggest entitlement programs ó Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security ó then we will strangle economic growth, destroy jobs and reduce our standard of living. With the national debt above $16 trillion, and with more than $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities hanging over us, our toughest fiscal decisions cannot be postponed any longer. Cornyn concluded in that op-ed by writing that a partial shutdown might be necessary "to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country,†rather than plod along the path of Greece, Italy and Spain." See all the conservatives urging the GOP to give up the debt ceiling fight &gt;
The Atascosa Ranch is walking distance from the US/Mexico border, just outside of Nogales, Arizona. It‚Äôs owned by Dave Lowell, an affable 84-year-old man who‚Äôs spent the past 75+ years hunting for buried treasure. Today, he‚Äôs known as the most successful mining explorationist of the past century, having discovered an unprecedented seventeen ore bodies, including the world‚Äôs largest copper mine. Last week, Lowell and his wife, Edith, invited us to Atascosa for lunch. We brought our cameras and sound equipment, and recorded a conversation with one of mining‚Äôs greatest outliers of all time. J. David Lowell was born February 28, 1928, to a modest family, not too far from Atascosa (the ranch belonged to his uncle at the time). Lowell was first exposed to mining at age 7, when his father, a mining engineer, put him to work. When Lowell pursued his college education at Arizona and then Stanford, he concurrently worked at mines and on exploration programs. Not too long after he had completed his degrees, Lowell had become one of the foremost experts on copper deposits. Lowell is probably best known today for co-authoring the Lowell-Guilbert Model, a guide to large, low-grade porphyry copper deposits published in 1970. Throughout most of his career, Lowell used the model to locate some of the most profitable mineral finds in the history of mining, such as the 1981 discovery of the Escondida deposit in Chile. Containing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of ore, Lowell and his colleagues found it at the cost of a mere $2.5 million. CEO.ca Over lunch of elk tacos and Meixcan fried beans, Lowell was modest about his success. But he offered a theory as to why major mining companies don‚Äôt make discoveries as efficiently as prospectors like Lowell. Major mining companies have a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make mistakes‚Äù approach, which ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt fit at all with the profile of the mad scientist who discovers mines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen something like one in five hundred good-looking targets will become a mine, a successful explorationist needs permission to be wrong four hundred and ninety-nine times.‚Äù Here he paused. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anything my career says about me, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm very good at being wrong.‚Äù Despite being a pro about being wrong, Lowell does admit to limitations. Having ‚Äúno taste for shareholder relations,‚Äù he recalled giving a presentation to investors in 1995 that resulted in the share price of one of his companies falling from $35 to $15 during the time it took him to finish his talk. The shares recovered shortly thereafter. On the changing impact of technology on mineral exploration over the span of his lifetime, Lowell holds that it‚Äôs been ‚Äúvery little.‚Äù He believes that ‚Äúgeophysics has been very oversold,‚Äù instead favoring ‚Äúdrill holes and geochemistry‚Ä¶ The best guide to ore is ore.‚Äù Lowell also voiced doubts that technology would be able to revolutionize mineral exploration the way 2D and 3D Seismic has for the oil and gas business, at least in the near future. The commodities super-cycle is in tact, Lowell believes. There‚Äôs elasticity in mining companies‚Äô profit margins, he told us, but not in the demand for the underlying commodities they produce. For that reason, large, undeveloped, low grade copper deposits will need to be put into production, sooner than later. When asked about his favourite jurisdictions for exploration currently, he told us he favors Chile, Peru, New Guinea, Mongolia, Nevada, and some parts of Africa. But he qualified his dispositions by recalling that attractive jurisdictions are constantly changing. ‚ÄúPlaces like Arizona were very attractive as a place to explore for copper deposits, and now Arizona is about as bad as Venezuela,‚Äù he chuckled. When we moved on to the role luck has played in his career, Lowell avoided answering directly. Instead he responded that ‚Äúminefinders who make one discovery are much more likely to find another.‚Äù His basic philosophy is that of persistence, and it shows ‚Äî his career is equally productive after retirement age as it was before. At age eighty-four, Lowell is not slowing down. With financiers Dave De Witt and Marcel De Groot of Pathway Capital (‚Äúas efficient, honest and reliable as partners get‚Äù), Lowell is developing several projects, including a titanium-iron deposit in Paraguay, which he believes is the largest of its kind in the world. Other active projects are under wraps for now, as to avoid competition. Investors who rode his Arequipa Resources shares from .20 to $30.00 in 1995 will surely be watching Lowell‚Äôs upcoming public ventures. An autobiography is also in the works. It was an honor to spend time with Dave at his ranch, and we‚Äôre pleased to share some video, pictures, and sounds of the day. We hope you enjoy the following short film about the greatest outlier and maverick the mining industry has known in recent memory, J. David Lowell. ¬†
The Federal Reserve just released transcripts to all of its meetings from 2007, the year the U.S. housing market took a turn for the worse and the economy entered recession. By the time the FOMC met in March, economic data had begun to weaken, and stocks and mortgage markets were starting to look shaky. The president of the San Francisco Fed, Janet Yellen ‚Äì now the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve and a possible candidate for the next chairmanship ‚Äì relayed to the committee a story about the bubble brewing in private equity, and how it could lead to financial instability. Below are Yellen's remarks: Despite the recent turmoil in equity and mortgage markets, a reassessment of overall risk has yet to occur. We are still in an environment of low long-term yields, ample liquidity, and what appears to be a generally low level of compensation for risk. For example, I recently talked with the principals of several major private-equity funds, who were not just amazed but also appalled about the amount of money their industry has attracted. [Laughter] One partner said that he would have no difficulty immediately raising $1 billion. Indeed, one of his biggest problems is would-be investors who get angry at him because he is unwilling to take their money. This unwillingness reflects his difficulty in identifying deals that are likely to yield adequate returns even though, for the buyout firms, debt also is available in what they depict as very attractive so-called covenant-lite terms‚Äîperhaps too attractive given the vulnerability of some of the highly leveraged yields. My contacts suggest that some private-equity firms with similar assessments of the shortage of profit opportunities are less restrained and do take additional money, partly because of the large upfront fees that are generated by these deals. So just as we have seen in mortgage markets, the bubble in private equity, as my sources characterize it, and the overabundance of liquidity more generally raise the risk of a sharp retrenchment in credit and higher risk spreads with associated risks to economic growth and, conceivably, even financial stability. Sure enough, a few months later, banks began taking big writedowns on credit investments and financing for private equity deals dried up, signaling a top in the market.
BCA ResearchTaxes on income, profits and capital gains account for 47% of tax revenue in the U.S. compared with a median 30% in other OECD countries.There are plenty of different ways to look at a country's tax rate. For instance, if you look at tax as a percentage of GDP, the U.S. has a relatively low rate. However, BCA Research goes one step further and considers the make up of those tax revenues. It turns out that the U.S. relies pretty heavily on incomes as a source of tax revenue. BCA believes this should be addressed when considering tax reform. "The U.S. tax system is desperately in need of reform. Tax revenues as a share of GDP need to rise, but this should be done by sweeping away all the loopholes and this could even allow marginal rates to come down. Ultimately, a national sales tax will probably be needed. This would broaden the tax base and reduce the heavy reliance of the U.S. on income taxes. Taxes on income, profits and capital gains account for 47% of tax revenue in the U.S. compared with a median 30% in other OECD countries." This is not to say that taxes on incomes should come down.¬† Rather, the U.S. should better diversify its sources of revenue.

OWN We hosted a school potluck at our house last night, but at 9pm, I was able to sneak into a bedroom and watch the Lance Armstrong interview. Here are some thoughts: Bottom line, it was a weird interview. Armstrong took responsibility for a lot of what I hoped he would take responsibility for. But if part of the point of publicly coming clean is to ask people to forgive him and start to root for him again, it doesn't seem like he's mentally and emotionally where he needs to be. It is just not okay to use your vast wealth and power to try to destroy friends and colleagues for doing nothing more than telling the truth about you. It is just not okay to sue so many former colleagues (who are telling the truth) that you can't even remember whether you sued one person in particular. (Armstrong assumed he had sued Emma O'Reilly, a former team trainer, because "we" sued so many people, but he didn't remember that suit in particular). It is just not okay to lie repeatedly, indignantly, and under oath and then not convey some regret or explanation for that. So it sounds to me as though Lance Armstrong still has a ways to go before he really understands why so many people are so pissed at and disappointed with him. Given that he has already had many years to think about it, I wonder if he ever will. SEE ALSO: Betsy Andreu Unloads On Lance Armstrong After His Bizarre Interview
DealbreakerLet the after-the-fact, hindsight mockery begin begin. Today, the Federal Reserve released its federal open market committee meeting transcripts for 2007. When we last dug through old FOMC transcripts, we found some amazing examples of how far off the Fed's forecast ended up being. Here is the opening statement from Chief Economist Dave Stockton for the December 11 session: Despite all the financial turmoil, the economy avoids recession and, even†with steeply higher prices for food and energy and a lower exchange value of the dollar, we achieve some modest edging-off of inflation. So I tried not to take it personally when I received a notice the other day that the Board had approved more frequent drug-testing for certain members of the senior staff, myself included. [Laughter] I can assure you, however, that the staff is not going to fall back on the increasingly popular celebrity excuse that we were under the influence of mind altering chemicals and thus should not be held responsible for this forecast. No, we came up with this projection unimpaired and on nothing stronger than many late nights of diet Pepsi and vending-machine Twinkies. This is all the more incredible given the NBER later determined December 2007 was the month when the Great Recession began. SEE MORE: The Story Of Japan's 1980s American Invasion&gt;
Wikimedia CommonsThe Japanese market rallied 2.86% last night. We're getting used to huge moves each day, as the stock market has been on fire since early November. The reason? After years and years of weak growth and deflation, new prime minister Shinzo Abe has promised ultra-aggressive easing on both the fiscal and monetary side of things. But the task is not without huge challenges. Bienville Capital Management has put together a fantastic guide to the state of Japanese stocks, the policy options available to the Bank of Japan and the ministry of finance, an explanation of why the yen could go much lower, and the huge structural challenges being faced by the economy. It's probably the best guide we've seen yet on the topic, by far. Huge thanks to Bienville Capital for their permission to run their fantastic presentation.

The Sinocism newsletter is compiled by Bill Bishop, and republished here with permission.†Be Informed About China.†The Sinocism China Newsletter.†Free. This morning China announced (Reuters) that 2012 Q4 GDP growth was 7.9%, just above the expected 7.8%, and full year 2012 GDP growth was 7.8%, the slowest since 1999. I am looking forward to analyst commentary on whether or not the numbers actually add up.Tension between China and Japan continue. In China and Japan square up: the drums of war The Economist writes that war is possible: Watch Chinese television these days and you might conclude that the outbreak of war with Japan over what it calls the Senkaku and China the Diaoyu islands is only a matter of time. You might well be right. Since Japan in September announced it would ìnationaliseî three of the islands that had been privately owned, China, which has long contested Japanís sovereignty over them, has also started challenging its resolve to keep control of them. So both countries are claiming to own the islands and both are pretending to administer them. China this week announced its intention to map them thoroughly. Something has to give. US diplomats are in the region and have called for ëcooler headsí in the island dispute (New York Times, official transcript of press conference in Tokyo here). If one of China's goals with the Dioyu escalation has been to drive a wedge between the US and Japan, it may not be achieved. Reuters reports that the US and Japan are reviewing defense guidelines amid tension with China: "We would like to discuss Japanese Self Defence Forces' role and U.S. forces role with eyes on the next five, 10, 15 years and on the security environment during those periods," a Defence Ministry official told reporters, without elaborating.The revision is due because of drastic changes in the security environment over the past 15 years including China's maritime expansion and North Korea's missile development, the Japanese government has said. Japan's Prime Minister Abe visited Southeast Asia this week on a trip that seems designed to enrage China. The Mainichi Shimbun reports that Japan and Vietnam to deepen security ties amid China's growing assertiveness: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Tan Dung agreed Wednesday to deepen bilateral security cooperation in the face of growing China's maritime assertiveness on the first leg of Abe's three-nation tour of Southeast Asia.Japan and Vietnam, both involved in territorial rows with China, confirmed their opposition to "changing the status quo by force" in the South China Sea, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko said, indirectly referring to China's disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines in the waters. Meanwhile, Former Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama has been in China and on a visit to Nanjing apologized for wartime crimes (Xinhua).Reuters has an excellent look at Chinese military officials and their use of the media in China's military hawks take the offensive: In a political system where civilian officials hew to tightly scripted public positions, these uniformed pundits, both serving and retired, appear free to go well beyond the official line. Almost all of the most-outspoken generals are military academics or theorists.Foreign military analysts are uncertain if the hawks represent a majority opinion in the 2.3 million-strong military or exercise real influence over foreign policy. It is also unclear if operational commanders share the views of these so-called "activist officers."However, there is one generally agreed explanation for their prominence: The PLA now has something to talk about. The military budget has soared to almost $200 billion, according to some Western estimates - the world's second-highest military budget behind the United States. That money has paid for the warships, strike aircraft and missiles allowing the PLA to plan for distant conflict. For the first time in its modern history, China has the firepower to contest control of disputed territory far from its coastal waters. There is a lot of money in being a hawk, in China and the US.Surprisingly, there can also be money, and other benefits, in being a Marxist theoretician. A senior official has been removed from his post for an "improper life style" (Xinhua): Yi Junqing, director of the Central Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has been removed from post for "improper life style," central authorities said Thursday. Jia Gaojian will replace him as the bureau's director.

Morgan Stanley reported earnings today that beat expectations. Analysts expected profits of $0.27 a share and the bank reported profits of $0.45 a share excluding accounting charges (see an explanation of that below). Of course share price and profits are interesting for a bank that was seeing losses of $0.15 a share this time last year, but in Morgan Stanley's case they're not as interesting as what's going on with compensation costs. The bank's CEO James Gorman has been the most vocal CEO on the Street about the need to cut costs in the business of banking. He's said that Wall Street has "too many overpaid bankers", and in Q1 2013 already announced 1600 layoffs and 100% deferred compensation for any employee making over $350,000 (except for wealth managers). In the first 9 months of 2012, the bank cut 4200 jobs.† It doesn't help that activist investor Dan Lobe has taken a stake in bank and made it clear that he thinks that some Morgan Stanley bankers are overpaid as well. That said: It's important to see what Gorman's hard line has done to his bank's bottom line.†Compensation expense of $3.6 billion in the current quarter declined from $3.8 billion a year ago. From the full year 2011 to the full year 2012, compensation expense declined from $16.3 billion to 15.6 billion, a change of 4%. Yup, just 4%, which means we may not have seen the last of the bloodletting from Morgan Stanley. Part of that is because if you include the accounting charges mentioned above, Morgan Stanley's profits only hit $0.25 a share. The charge is a debt valuation adjustment (DVA). It places a value on the company's debt, and if that increases, it reflects how expensive it would be for the company (Morgan Stanley) to buy it back. According to Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley took a $2.3 billion hit this year when its credit spreads tightened. So there's still some ways to go here.

The euro fell sharply against the dollar around 7:45 AM. The move is being connected with comments made by ECB Executive Board Member¬†Beno√Æt¬†C≈ìur√© around the same time about LTRO repayments. There's been chatter about European banks possibly beginning to repay loans early to the ECB from the central bank's LTROs (long-term refinancing operations) initiated in 2011. The loans were offered to troubled eurozone banks to boost liquidity in the banking system. Early repayments of the loans would likely put upward pressure on interbank borrowing rates, because banks would have to turn elsewhere for short-term funding. Bloomberg's Katie Linsell explains: Banks can soon start repaying about 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) of cheap loans that the ECB provided under its longer- term refinancing operations to avert a credit crunch. Concern the Frankfurt-based central bank will tighten its collateral rules also helped push indicators of future interbank borrowing costs higher. ‚ÄúThe repayment of the LTRO money has the potential to throw key market trends into reverse,‚Äù¬†Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG in¬†Frankfurt, wrote in a note. ‚ÄúReportedly the ECB is mulling plans to restrict loan collateral. This would add to the pressure on peripheral banks to reduce ECB funding,‚Äù though only marginally, he wrote. C≈ìur√© just said that he doesn't expect LTRO repayments to have any impact on EONIA, one of two main interbank borrowing rates used in the eurozone. However, with those borrowing rates rising in recent days, perhaps on expectations that early repayments would affect impact EONIA, the euro has rallied as well. Thus,¬†C≈ìur√©'s comments may have sparked the selloff. The euro fell from around 1.3270 to 1.3195 after¬†C≈ìur√©'s comments, but it's since rebounded a bit: Thinkorswim

Chinese economic growth was a primary driver of the world-wide economic recovery from the great depression.¬† Thanks to a massive stimulus program initiated and implemented by the Chinese (a purely Keynes based program), China went on a massive infrastructure build.¬† This in turn increased the country's demand for raw materials which drove the economic growth of raw materials exporters like Australia, Brazil and Russia.¬† In essence, the BRIC countries -- thanks to China's spending -- prevented the world from collapsing into a world wide depression. However, over the last 18-24 months, the Chinese central bank increased rates and raised reserve requirements in an effort to slow inflation and stave off a real estate bubble.¬† Here is a chart from the St. Louis Fed system of the Chinese discount rate:  Notice the increase at the end of 2010 from 2.8% to 3.2%.¬† This had the intended overall effect one would expect from the central bank increasing rates and reserve ratios: the Chinese economy slowed (slow, however, is a relative term, as the economy is still growing at a 7.7% clip).¬†¬† Just as importantly, inflation slowed:  Note that the year over year percentage change dropped from over 4% in late 2011/early 2012 to the 2.5% readings we see now.¬† In addition, the current inflation spike is largely attributed to a cold winter which is spiking food costs, a situation which should abate in the Spring.  Finally -- and certainly not to be overlooked -- is the transfer of power to a new generation of party leaders which also occurred last year -- a situation which is not conducive to bold strokes.¬† I believe that this process has greatly hampered the economic decision making ability of China.¬† However, with prices now more under control and the transfer of power complete, China appears ready to grow again. Let's take a look at the overall situation to get a better feel for what might be in store for 2013. One of the most read and perhaps most influential Chinese economic¬† report is is the HSBC manufacturing index.¬† Here is the summation from the latest report:After adjusting for seasonal factors, the HSBC Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index‚Ñ¢ (PMI‚Ñ¢) ‚Äì a composite indicator designed to give a single-figure snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing economy ‚Äì posted 51.5 in December, up from 50.5 in November, signalling a modest improvement of operating conditions in the Chinese manufacturing sector. Moreover, it was the highest index reading since May 2011.¬†Output at manufacturing plants in China expanded in December, and for the second month in a row. Although the rate of expansion was modest, it was the fastest in 21 months. Total new orders also increased but at a faster pace than in November, the quickest since January 2011. Exactly 15% of panellists noted increased order volumes, a number of which attributed growth to increased client demand. Meanwhile, new export orders fell slightly following a modest increase in November. Just over 12% of firms reported lower new export orders in the latest survey period. Fewer export sales were linked to weak demand in Europe, Japan and the US.  Here is a chart of the composite index:  While this index has been right below an expansion reading for about a year, note it never collapsed.¬† This tells us there was still activity, but it was more subdued.¬† However, the last two months we've seen an increase about the 50 level, indicating an expansion is now a possibility. Moving on to the Services index, see the following summation of activity:The HSBC China Composite PMI data (which covers both manufacturing and services) signalled a modest expansion of business activity during December. Output has now risen for four consecutive months. Moreover, the rate of growth quickened slightly from November to the fastest in the current sequence. The HSBC China Composite Output Index posted 51.8 in December, up from 51.6 in November. Output increased across both the manufacturing and service sectors during December. The rates of expansion were broadly similar, with both sectors signalling modest growth. However, the rate of expansion in services slowed further, with the HSBC China Services Business Activity Index recording 51.7 in December, down from 52.1. New orders also rose in both the manufacturing and service sectors during December. Growth of new business in the service sector was slightly faster in December than in November, but remained modest overall. Total new orders in the manufacturing sector also grew at a stronger pace in December, and largely drove the increase in composite new orders,¬† which rose at the quickest rate since October 2011.  Notice that during the same period when manufacturing was slowing, services also printed more modest numbers.¬† However, this sector of the economy remained positive in comparison to manufacturing's slightly negative reading. China is attempting to reorient its economic model from an export-oriented model to a consumer led model.¬† On that note, the Chinese consumer is certainly doing their fair share as evidenced in Chinese retail sales:  Notice that during the period of the manufacturing slowdown, Chinese retail sales were still increasing at a very fast clip, indicating domestic demand was still very much alive and in decent shape.¬† Here is the summation from the  In November, the total retail sales of consumer goods reached 1,847.7 billion yuan, up by 14.9 percent year-on-year (nominal growth rate. The real growth rate was 13.6 percent. The follows are nominal growth rates if there‚Äôs no additional explanation). Of the total, the retail sales of consumer goods of industrial enterprises (units) above designated size was 939.5 billion yuan, increased 15.1 percent. From January to November, the total retail sales of consumer goods reached 18,683.3 billion yuan, up by 14.2 percent year-on-year (actual increase was 12.0 percent after deducting price factors). The total retail sales of consumer goods increased 1.47 percent in November, month-on-month.
WASHINGTON (AP) ó Most Americans think jarring economic problems will erupt if lawmakers fail to increase the government's borrowing limit. Yet they're torn over how or even whether to raise it, leaning toward Republican demands that any boost be accompanied by spending cuts. According to an Associated Press-GfK poll, 53 percent say that if the debt limit is not extended and the U.S. defaults, the country will face a major economic crisis. An additional 27 percent say such a crisis would be somewhat likely, while just 17 percent largely dismiss the prospects of such damage. Separately, Republican officials said Wednesday that GOP lawmakers may seek a short-term extension of the debt limit, thus avoiding a default as early as next month by the U.S. Treasury while they try to negotiate spending cuts with President Barack Obama over the next few months. "The worst thing for the economy is for this Congress and this administration to do nothing to get our debt and deficits under control," said Rep. Paul Ryan, the party's 2012 vice presidential candidate who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. The poll's findings echo many economists' warnings that failure to raise the debt ceiling and the resulting, unprecedented federal default would risk wounding the world economy because many interest rates are pegged to the trustworthiness of the U.S. to pay its debts. Obama and many Republicans agree with that, though some GOP lawmakers eager to force Obama to accept spending cuts have downplayed a default's impact. When asked which political path to follow, 39 percent of poll respondents support the insistence by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that deep spending cuts be attached to any measure increasing the debt ceiling. That's more than the 30 percent who back Obama's demand that borrowing authority be raised quickly and not entwined with a bitter fight over trimming the budget. An additional 21 percent oppose boosting the debt ceiling at all. The survey was conducted as the two parties gird for a debt-limit battle that is likely to dominate the next two months in the capital. The fight is sure to underscore partisan differences over how to curb federal deficits that have surpassed $1 trillion for four straight years. Obama insists that besides spending cuts there should be more tax increases on the wealthy, which the GOP opposes. While saying he will refuse to negotiate on the debt ceiling, Obama has said he will bargain separately on finding ways to reduce the annual federal deficit. Despite the majority in the survey who fear severe economic problems if the debt limit is not raised, in a separate question only about 3 in 10 supported the general idea of increasing the ceiling. Four in 10 opposed it, with the rest expressing neutral feelings. Democrats were about twice as likely as Republicans to support boosting the borrowing limit, while Republicans were likelier than Democrats by a similar margin to oppose an increase. The government reached its $16.4 trillion borrowing limit Dec. 31 but has avoided default by using cash from pension and other funds it administers, money that will eventually be replaced. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said his ability to use such bookkeeping measures will be exhausted by early March or sooner. Wayne Wiedrich, 46, an engineering inspector in Williston, N.D., said in a poll follow-up interview that he agrees that failure to boost the debt ceiling would risk severe problems. "But on the other hand, it's not doing the economy any good to raise the debt limit, print money and spend money we don't have. One of these days China will come knocking on our door and say, 'We own you,'" he said, referring to the country that holds more U.S. debt than any other nation. Homemaker Sherry Giordano, 59, of Feasterville, Pa., disagreed. "It has to be done," she said of raising the borrowing limit. "We shouldn't risk our reputation or spend money and time arguing about it. We have to pay our debts." The survey showed slight shifts in concerns about the economy and federal budget deficits. Eighty-six percent consider the economy a top issue, down 5 percentage points from last summer, while 76 percent have the same view on federal deficits, up 7 points since then. Around one-third expect the economy to worsen over the next year, the highest figure in AP-GfK polling in nearly two years. Less than 1 in 4 think the economy is in good shape, a fairly stable number since last summer. Despite the slight edge people give the GOP's debt limit path, the survey showed Obama with some advantages as he begins his second term. Fifty-four percent approve of how he is handling his job, a figure that has changed little over the past year. That is more than triple Congress' 17 percent approval rating, which edged down 6 percentage points since early December, before the two sides' "fiscal cliff" fight ended with Republicans largely accepting Obama's demands to raise taxes on the country's highest earners. Democrats also have a slight 41 percent to 36 percent advantage over Republicans as the party more trusted to handle the economy. Both Obama and Congress have fallen in the public's esteem after their last battle over the debt ceiling. In AP-GfK polling in June 2011, the president held a 52 percent approval rating. By August, it had declined to 46 percent after down-to-the-wire negotiations with Congress. Congressional approval ratings fell even further, from an already weak 21 percent in June to just 12 percent after the year's debt limit standoff finally ended. When it comes to finding savings to balance the budget, nearly half prefer cutting government services as the GOP wants, 3 in 10 would rather increase taxes and about 1 in 10 would do both. The percentage backing cuts in federal services has dropped 13 percentage points since the spring of 2011, while the number supporting tax cuts has changed little. The poll also highlighted how public support dwindles when people are asked about specific cuts. Given four ideas for reducing budget deficits, only one got majority support: charging top earners higher Medicare premiums, backed by 60 percent. That included roughly even proportions of Democrats and Republicans, and majorities of all income groups in the poll. Only 30 percent back slowing the growth of annual Social Security benefit increases, which Obama agreed to accept in failed talks with Boehner on crafting a deficit-reduction compromise during the "fiscal cliff" fight. Just 35 percent support gradually raising the current Medicare eligibility age of 65, and 41 percent support defense cuts. The poll involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 randomly chosen adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. It was conducted from Jan. 10 to 14 by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Corporate Communications. ___ AP news survey specialist Dennis Junius contributed to this report.

Despite the problems facing the U.S. economy, the dysfunction in Washington and slowing global growth, stocks continue to rise on the basis of what we view as false assumptions.¬† These assumptions are as follows: 1)¬†¬†¬† ¬†Since almost every central bank in the world is aggressively easing, the market cannot go down. 2)¬†¬†¬† Although the U.S. is facing a fight in Washington over the debt limit, the sequester and the expiration of the annual federal appropriation, various political threats over the last two years have passed without substantial market damage, and the same will happen this time. 3)¬†¬†¬† S&amp;P 500 earnings will rise to $108 in 2013, resulting in a current P/E multiple of only 13.7. 4)¬†¬†¬† The economic recovery will kick into full gear once the problems in Washington are solved or again "kicked down the road." We disagree.¬† Despite massive ease by the Fed and stimulative fiscal policy, the economy has grown at only a 2.2% annualized rate since the recovery started in the 2nd quarter of 2009.¬† That pales in comparison to the average of 3.6% between 1950 and 1999----and that period included both recoveries and recessions.¬† The Fed, however, has run out of ammunition.¬† The funds rate has been near zero since 2008 while each successive round of quantitative easing has had less and less effect.¬† GDP estimates for the 4th quarter of 2012 are only between 0.5% and 1.5%. Economic growth has shown few signs of being sustainable on its own.¬† It is worth pointing out that GDP growth has consistently been overestimated throughout the recovery.¬† The Fed, for instance, originally forecast GDP growth of 4.5% for 2012. Moreover, fiscal policy, which has previously been supportive of economic growth, is fast becoming a headwind instead.¬† The fiscal cliff agreement, although celebrated by the market, raised taxes and reduced spending by enough to slice between 1% and 1.5% off GDP this year.¬† No matter how the upcoming debates are resolved, they are all about cutting deficits through some combination of spending reductions and tax increases.¬† A portion of this will be applicable to 2013, and result in additional deductions from economic growth. In our view S&amp;P 500 earnings for 2013 will come in far under the $108 forecast by the consensus.¬† Earnings in the 3rd quarter were substantially under predictions made earlier in the year while revenues were about flat year-over-year. The 4th quarter results are likely to be no better.¬†¬† Furthermore, cyclically smoothed reported (GAAP) earnings are only at about $75, meaning that the market is significantly overvalued, rather than cheap. Investors are also ignoring the headwinds from slowing growth or recession across the globe.¬† Europe and Japan are in recession while China is slowing down, meaning that the export-dependent emerging economies will be hit as well.¬† The new Japanese government has now taken actions to devalue the yen in order to increase exports.¬† This is already increasing the strength of the euro to the consternation of the EU, which is likely to take action to defend its currency.¬† The potential result is a global currency war in which everyone loses. Investors think that once Washington gets its act together the economy will be off to the races. We doubt that will be the case.¬† For about 25 years consumers binged on debt and reduced their savings rates as real household income stagnated.¬† We are now in a period where consumers will be paring down debt and raising savings rates, resulting in tepid spending at best for some time to come.¬† In this kind of climate capital expenditure growth will also remain sub-par in response to lack of demand for products and services. The cyclical bull market is now almost four years old and is close to the historical average in terms of both amplitude and duration.¬† At this point it is out of sync with economic growth and valuation, and the risks seem far greater than the potential rewards. ¬†¬†¬†¬†

As we wrote about yesterday, one of the biggest moves in currencies has been the Euro rallying against the Swiss Franc. Back in the crisis days, the euro plunged against the Swiss Franc, as everyone rushed their money into Switzerland, to escape the crumbling Eurozone. Then the Swiss National Banc -- fretting about the strength of its own currency and the potential negative economic ramifications -- put a ceiling on Franc strength, and so the Euro didn't move against the Franc for a long time. But now that fears are subsiding in Europe, we're seeing the opposite of the run on Europe, and a run back into Eurozone, as folks repatriate their cash back out of Switzerland. The Euro had a huge week against the Franc, and it's continuing today, as this chart from Bloomberg shows. Bloomberg The Davos conference in Switzerland is about to start. The timing of this move is just perfect timing, as visitors to Switzerland will finally catch a bit of a break.
In case you missed it, Japan had a huge day. The Nikkei surged 2.8%.  The story remains that the government is pursuing aggressive monetary and fiscal easing. That's weakening the yen, boosting inflation hopes, and boosting stocks. According to Nikkei.com, the big rally comes as the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance (Japan's Treasury Department) are talking about cooperating more on policy. This is one of the most taboo concepts in modern economics. Traditional economists will go pale, and the blood drain from their faces at the mention of non-independent monetary policy. The Treasury is supposed to do fiscal policy. The central bank is supposed to do monetary policy. And that's that. Well Japan is in the process of breaking that rule, and the market is loving it. And as economist Paul McCulley wrote in a new paper, that's a good thing... in times of liquidity traps, etc., you need the government and the central bank to move together, with the same purpose, even if it means "monetizing" the debt or lost independence.
Wikimedia CommonsUS futures, Europe are all pretty much going nowhere right now. That's fine. Those markets have been on a tear. But it was a huge night in Asia. Chinese stocks rallied 1.4% on the back of a decent GDP report, which saw Q4 growth hit 7.9%, slightly above expectations. And the ongoing Yen depreciation show in Japan caused the Nikkei to jump 2.8%, one of its biggest session gains in a long time. Hong Kong also gained 1.12%.
