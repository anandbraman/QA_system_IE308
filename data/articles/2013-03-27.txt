ReutersRising inflation, higher property prices, and policymakers' focus on growth has raised a few questions about Chinese monetary tightening.Â  But there has been much confusion about what metrics to track. Should we be watching broad money supply, measures of credit like loan growth, total social financing (TSF) and so on, or interest rates.Â  In a new note, Bank of America's Ting Lu writes that the three best indicators of China's "monetary stance" are seven-day repo rates, revised TSF growth, and loan growthÂ  Based on these indicators, Lu writes that monetary policy will be 'neutral' in the first half of the year and will be modestly tightened in the second half. The seven-day repo rate is expected to stay between 3 - 3.5 percent in the first half of the year. Bank loan growth is expected to be around 15 percent and is expected to ease to 14.3 percent by the end of the year. Revised TSF growth is forecast to be between 18 - 20 percent in the first half of the year, before easing to about 16 percent in the second half.
Cypriot banks re-open from their long holiday at noon Cyprus time or 6 AM ET. The country has already announced capital controls (limits on how much money people can withdraw or transfer from their accounts) to prevent a mass exodus. But the demand for money is expected to be huge, and people are bracing for some kind of a run, perhaps. This convoy of trucks -- photographed by Reuters -- was reported by local media to be carrying tons of euros to prepare for the bank reopening. REUTERS/Andreas Manolis  The full Reuters caption: A policeman stands guard in front of trucks carrying containers at the Central Bank in Nicosia March 27, 2013. The contents of the containers could not be verified by Reuters but local media reported they contained cash for the banks' reopening on Thursday. Cyprus is set to restrict the flow of cash from the island and may curb the use of Cypriot credit cards abroad as it tries to avert a run on its banks after agreeing a tough rescue package with international lenders. 
It's a risk off night. US futures are lower as is the Aussie dollar. The big weight: China, which is getting taken down amid a barrage of reports about new regulations in the real estate and financial sectors. The main Shanghai Composite is down 2.3%. These two images/tweets from CNBC's Deirdre Wang Morris tell more about what's going on. Seems to be an issue related to expectations of more property curbs and also fresh regulations on China's infamous wealth-management products, per this story in the WSJ.

Despite concerns about a Chinese economic slowdown, Yale professor and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, Stephen Roach continues to be optimistic on the Asian giant. During a debate with Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates at Asia Society, Roach said he differs with Chanos on one key thing: China's ability to change its economic model. Roach believes that China is rebalancing its economy and moving away from exports and investment, to consumption and services-led growth. Chanos on the other hand argues that China is unlikely to change its economic model, and if it does, it isn't imminent. For proof of such change in the next two or three years, Roach is looking at 5 key things: Chanos of course disagreed and said, "I don't believe that with or without an 18-year plan, that seven guys in a room can manage the economy and get it right. ...Central planning light is still central planning and it sows the seeds of its own demise. The model is fundamentally contradictory in the 21st century."
Yeah, some things in life are inevitable. That's why it was no surprise, though still endlessly amusing, to find that while depositors of Laiki Bank (aka Cyprus Popular Bank) on the island itself have been unable to get to their money for 10 days now, Laiki's 4 branches in the UK have all that time simply remained open for business. Which also means that richer clients in Cyprus will lose between 40% and 100% of their savings above €100,000, unless they were smart enough to fly to Britain in time and transfer it all to another bank. Still, Laiki Bank UK is simply a branch of the mothership Laiki Bank on Cyprus, with the difference that deposits fall under UK deposit "compensation" laws. Unlike Bank of Cyprus UK, Laiki is not incorporated under UK law. And I had been wondering why everyone was talking about Russian depositors in Cyprus, but nobody mentioned the Brits, who must have tons of bank accounts there, the island being a former colony and all. I guess perhaps I have my answer now. Laiki has had UK branches since 1974, nothing strange there, long running ties (though never incorporation). But it also has majority interests in banks in Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Malta and other countries. Maybe someday we'll find out what happened there since March 16. For instance, how much money was taken out at Laiki Moscow in the past 10 days? For the moment, I'd be satisfied with details on what went on in its UK branches. What remains at Laiki will need to be used to pay off debt. But if the ship has been leaking like a sieve all the time, how much is left to do that with? And whatever has been taken out will come at the expense of what has not: it could easily be the difference between losing 40% or 100%. Just a guess, to be sure, but that's all anybody has right now. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (who today sent another plane carrying €13 million in cash for British soldiers stationed in Cyprus) says he's working on a plan to exempt British branches - and their clients - of Cypriot banks from the worst of the Laiki mess, i.e. make all British citizens whole. Leaving the UK branches open for business, and not telling the outside world, would seem to be a firm step in that direction. Think maybe the 4 branches have called their (best) clients with a warning or two? After a friendly call from Osborne's office? Barclays has "offered" to speed up opening accounts especially for the purpose. Good patriots... Holland and Britain made 340,000 savers at Iceland's Landesbanki whole when it collapsed in 2008. Will they do the same this time? For all those people who moved their money and accounts to Cyrpus to avoid domestic tax schemes? This has the makings of a good story. Unless you're simply a hard working Cypriot living on Cyprus. Then you're simply screwed.
One of the most frustrating and depressing aspects of U.S. politics right now is that so little federal money is being spent on domestic public infrastructure. We're happy to spend a staggering ~$800 billion a year on our military--another worthy cause. But we are so appalled by the amount that we spend on our domestic infrastructure that we recently chopped public construction spending from $320 billion to $275 billion a year. Given our high unemployment rate and extraordinarily low borrowing costs, now would be a perfect time for the government to commit a few trillion dollars over the next decade to bringing our decaying infrastructure into the 21st Century. After all, high-quality infrastructure improves life for everyone in the country, not just rich people or middle-class people or the other voting blocks that our two big political parties are always sucking up to. Infrastructure spending also doesn't train people to expect handouts or support wasteful consumer behavior--two complaints about social programs like food stamps and Medicare. Infrastructure spending creates jobs throughout the economy. And it reduces unemployment and social program spending (because more people go back to work). But infrastructure spending is not just not being increased in the U.S.--it's getting cut. If you spend a lot of time within our country's borders, you get used to how old and decrepit much of our infrastructure is. But step outside the U.S. for a few days, and you remember. I've spent the last few days in the UK, a country whose government is even more obsessed with cutting government spending than our government is. The UK is so insistent on cutting spending that it has thrown its economy into what looks like a triple-dip recession (needlessly so, in the opinion of many respected economists). But the UK still finds money to spend on its public infrastructure. Such as this dime-a-dozen commuter train line from London to Hampton Court in the picture below. I can't remember ever riding in a Metro-North train that looked like this. The London train was also perfectly on time, of course. With digital ticketing (the same digital ticket system that works with the London subway.) And it has all the other attributes that citizens in most developed countries expect their trains to have. [UPDATE: I have now been informed that this is a private train line (subsidized by the government) running on public track. And some folks on Twitter are complaining that, since the line was privatized, prices have soared and rush-hour is jammed. So this particular international comparison with the U.S. may not be apt.]   Business Insider, St. Louis Fed Business Insider, St. Louis Fed Yes, maybe this train's just a one-off. But the other trains, subways, and buses I've ridden on were clean and new, too. If even the austerity-obsessed UK can buy public transportation equipment like this, can't we? Is that really so much to ask? In case you prefer data to pictures, here's some data for you. US public construction spending has declined sharply over the last five years: Business Insider, St. Louis Fed US public construction spending, in fact, has now hit its lowest level as a percent of GDP since the this data series began in the early 1990s: Business Insider, St. Louis Fed US military spending, meanwhile, is 3X as big as US public construction spending. And it has barely decreased at all: Business Insider, St. Louis Fed Yes, if we trim military spending, we won't be able to fight quite so many wars in so many other countries at once.  But our bridges, roads, trains, airports, electrical grids, and schools in our own country are old and deteriorating.  So even assuming that was have to cut federal spending--which I, for one (and, more importantly, many respected economists) don't think we have to--is this really the way we want to spend our money? Really? Or is it just that our government in Washington has become so bought-off and dysfunctional that it can't even make choices that will benefit everyone?
On a long solo car trip last week, I listened to several podcasts to pass the time. One was a classic: The Invention of Money, originally released by NPR's Planet Money team back in January of 2011. I highly recommend listening (or re-listening) to it in full. The podcast is an effective reminder of how any currency in a monetary system is a fabricated construct. A simpler way to explain this is to say it has value simply because we believe it does. Through the centuries – in historic cultures like that of Yap Island who used giant, immovable stone disks for commerce, to today's United States, whose Dollar fiat currency exists primarily in digital form – "money" is able to be exchanged for goods and services because society agrees to accept it (at a certain rate of exchange). But what happens when a society starts doubting the value of its money? The podcast goes into the mind-blowingly simple process by which new money is created in America by the Federal Reserve (or the "Fed"). That is to say: The banks then, if they want to, lend this new money out into the economy on a fractional basis, adding even more "thin air" dollars to the nation's money supply. This unique ability in America lends the Fed enormous power. The power to create new money from nothing. With no limit. And with that power, the Fed can control and/or influence economies and markets the world over. Should such power exist? And if so, should a single private entity owned by the major players in the banking system be allowed to wield it? Such power certainly has its dangers. Back in 2011, the Planet Money team described the normally staid Fed as having "gone to central-bank Crazytown". Panicked by the global credit contraction, the Fed began a series of programs intent on combating the deflationary force of credit defaults. It essentially force-fed liquidity (a.k.a. freshly-printed dollars) to the world, using ham-fisted tactics that it had fastidiously eschewed over the previous century: As the financial crisis unfolded, the Fed created...trillion[s of] dollars, which it lent out as emergency loans to all the big names on Wall Street: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, huge banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. The Fed lent money to private equity firms, hedge funds, and even regular companies like Verizon, GE, and Harley Davidson. And it wasn't just the recipients of that cash that were new. It was also what the Fed was requiring in return: the collateral. In the past, in the rare instances that the Fed used its powers to serve as the lender of last resort, it demanded the highest quality collateral in return. Assets that were safe and would hold their value. But in 2008, the Fed started accepting all sorts of...collateral that just months ago it never would have touched. The sheer amount of new money that the Fed created was unprecedented. From the time we went off the gold standard of 1933 until 2008, the Fed had created a net total of $800 billion. In the months after the financial crisis, that number nearly tripled to almost $2.4 trillion. [The Fed was] spending more newly created money in just 15 months than [it] had created in its entire history up until 2008. And what effect did this fast-and-loose money-printing bonanza have? The big banks were able to recapitalize their damaged balance sheets while continuing to pay themselves record bonuses. Commodities, priced around the globe in U.S. dollars, became much more costly as many more dollars competed for the same amount of real assets. And financial assets, like stocks and bonds, marched upwards, raised by the unrelenting rising tide of Fed liquidity. Notice however, that the economy itself did not fundamentally improve in the way the Fed had hoped it would. While a collapse of the system was averted (delayed?), economic growth has remained sluggish, unemployment high, and real wages stagnant or worse. Of course, the reason for this is simple. Money is not wealth. It is merely a claim on wealth. You can't print your way to prosperity. History is abundantly clear on that.  With the clarity of hindsight, it's now obvious how the Fed has now painted itself into a corner. Here's how the stock market has fared during the Fed's rescue efforts:  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, the picture above is worth several trillion dollars (some would argue as much as $9 trillion). The financial markets have become dependent on new Fed dollars. If you look at the few gray segments of the chart, the stock market swoons nearly immediately once the Fed halts its balance-sheet expansion. For whatever reason (perhaps because it's owned by banks?), the Federal Reserve has chosen to use the price of financial securities as the signaling device that its efforts are yielding results. But the markets, like any junkie, demand greater and more frequent infusions to reach new highs. Note how the trend of successive Fed programs yields smaller and shorter-lived boosts. The Fed lives in fear of re-entering recession while unemployment and wealth inequality remain stubbornly elevated. With so many families teetering at the edge, things could get ugly very quickly if a fall in asset prices were to create a "reverse wealth effect" that triggered another recessionary slowdown. So as long as low single-digit GDP growth persists, the Fed's hands are tied. It must continue to print. No matter that the rising price of financial assets grossly benefits the top classes – namely the 1% who own 40% of the entire nation's wealth. In stark contrast, the bottom 80% of Americans own only 7%. No matter that the Fed's money tsunami is creating asset bubbles (again) in stocks, bonds, college tuition, housing, commodities, etc. – further eroding that bottom eighty percent's ability to form capital to fund its future. The Fed has gone "all in" here. There is no Plan B. Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic. Perhaps the Fed has just the right talent and tools we need to finesse our way out of the challenges we face. Unlikely. As for the talent, the key body that makes decisions on the money supply is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Many of its members have only had academic and/or government positions throughout their working careers. Voting members with actual business operating expertise, or experience running a commercial bank, for that matter, are rare. And as for tools, the Fed only really has one: the interest rate. It can move it up or down. But the effects take time to be felt in the markets. And it is a blunt, imprecise tool, at best. Again from the Planet Money podcast, where interviewer Alex Blumberg is talking with Gerald O'Driscoll, former vice president of the Dallas Regional Federal Reserve: Alex Blumberg: I sort of think of it like a joystick. You move it too far in one direction, you get out-of-control inflation. You move it too far in the other direction and then you can really sort of put the brakes on the economy. Is that too simplistic a way of thinking about it or is that? Gerald O'Driscoll: I mean, it's okay to think about it that way. I winced a little when you said that, because the joystick presumes a very precise control, which is exactly what they don't have. Alex Blumberg: Right. Gerald O'Driscoll: It's more like you're moving a super tanker and you start moving the wheel and there's no effect that you can see for quite a while. In fact, the inner sanctum itself, where the all-important FOMC meetings takes place, seems much less like the rarified Olympian god-chamber we'd expect, and more like the conference room from Office Space: Whatever you imagine the room looks like where you can create one and a quarter trillion dollars, this is not it. It is not grand. It is not ornate. It is not ceremonial. It has four grey cubicles, it has computer screens, and there's no other way to say this: It's a mess. There are papers and notes scattered around. There is a yoga ball someone has been sitting on. And there is a basketball net, possibly Nerf brand. This is where the magic happens. The reality is, the Federal Reserve is like any other organization. Human. And fallible. And like any other organization, it makes its best assessment of what the future holds and places its bets accordingly. For those who want to argue that the Fed, with its cadre of hyper-degreed academics and its insider access, has superior information and thus the ability to predict the future with unparalleled accuracy; I humbly ask you to watch the following:  In Hollywood, they say you're only as good as your last movie. By that metric, the Fed's latest sanguine prognostications should be taken with a huge amount of salt(ed popcorn): Cyprus does not pose a threat to the U.S. economy or financial system and there are no signs of stock market bubble, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday. The Fed chief told reporters that the central bank was monitoring the situation in Cyprus. "At this point, we're not seeing a major risk to the U.S. financial system or the U.S. economy," he said. And while the cheap money supplied by the Fed has pushed up stock prices, Bernanke said the central bank isn't measuring the success of its policies against moves in stocks. He also said the recent advance was not out of line with historical patterns. "I don't think it's all that surprising that the stock market would rise given that there has been increased optimism about the economy and...profit increases have been substantial," he said. Sound familiar? Are you feeling comforted yet? So, how much confidence can we really have in the Fed to navigate these yet uncharted monetary waters, with so many variables and unknowns, and its less-than-spot-on record? Honestly, we'd be fools to assume much. Cyprus has awakened the world to the reality that central planners can appropriate their money with the bang of a gavel. And while we don't yet know with certainty how things will unfold in Cyprus, we can project that events there have shaken society's confidence in the soundness of fiat currency in general. If we know it can be confiscated or devalued overnight, we are less likely to unquestioningly accept its stated value. This doubt that strikes at the very foundation of modern monetary systems. Cyprus is meaningful in the way that it shines a light on both the importance of hard assets and the risk it poses to market stability. It certainly increases the risk of our prediction of a 40%+ stock-market correction by September, as investors begin to realize that current high values are simply the ephemeral effect of too much money, instead of a sign of true value. At this point, prudence suggests we prepare for the worst (by parking capital on the sidelines, investing in our personal resilience, etc.) and add to our hard asset holdings (like precious metals bullion, productive real estate, etc.) as insurance to protect our purchasing power. The dollar may strengthen for a bit versus other currencies and perhaps the financial markets, but the long-term trend is a safer and surer bet: Dollars will be inflated. There will be more of them in the future than there are today. So, while our dollars still have the purchasing power they do, we should use the window of time we have now to exchange paper money for tangible wealth at today's prices. Those with a shorter time horizon, higher risk tolerance, and capital to spare may want to start considering a strategy for going short the financial markets. Next stop: Crazytown!
Marc Faber, who authors the Gloom Boom &amp; Doom newsletter, is usually pretty bearish on stocks and bullish on gold. Lately, though, gold doesn't seem like it can catch a bid. "Despite the continued reverberations regarding the Cyprus bailout and its involvement of bank deposits, gold struggled to maintain the positive momentum created in the first two weeks of March and instead now looks very likely to move lower, towards $1580/oz," wrote Deutsche Bank commodities analyst Xiao Fu in a note this morning. So, what does Faber have to say about it? This morning, on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Alix Steel, Dr. Doom was asked why gold wasn't holding up. Here's his explanation: When you print money, the money does not flow evenly into the economic system. It stays essentially in the financial service industry and among people that have access to these funds, mostly well-to-do people. It does not go to the worker. I just mentioned that it doesn't flow evenly into the system. Now from time to time it will lift the NASDAQ like between 1997 and March 2000. Then it lifted home prices in the U.S. until 2007. Then it lifted the commodity prices in 2008 until July 2008 when the global economy was already in recession. More recently it has lifted selected emerging economies, stock markets in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, up four times from 2009 lows and now the U.S. So we are creating bubbles and bubbles and bubbles. This bubble will come to an end. My concern is that we are going to have a systemic crisis where it is going to be very difficult to hide. Even in gold, it will be difficult to hide. Faber is, of course, still bearish on U.S. stocks. He told Bloomberg that he sees "considerable downside risk" in the market.
FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Why Companies Should Stop Calling On Bullish Analysts At Conference Calls (The Wall Street Journal) A study by economists Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy at Harvard, and Dong Lou at the London School of Economics looked at conference calls by U.S. companies between 2003 - 2011. They found that companies that called on more bullish analysts during conference calls "often just met, or barely exceeded earnings forecasts â€“ something that can be a sign of manipulated earnings â€“ and were more likely to restate earnings later," according to The WSJ. They were also more likely to have a follow on public offering after the event to help share prices. Moreover, they found that a portfolio that shorted these companies and were long the rest would be more likely to beat the market by 10 - 12 percent a year.  Advisors Are Preparing To Deal With Clients When Interest Rates Rise (Financial Planning) Advisors expect interest rates to rise and are preparing their clients for such an event. While many investors chasing yield have diversified into riskier investments, they look at rising interest rates as an opportunity to rebalance their client's portfolios. Wesley Long of Private Client Services at Wedbush anticipates that rising interest rates will cause the value of some existing bonds to decline and says clients need to be prepared for these changes. Corporate Cash Hoarding Is One Of The Most Perpetuated Myths In Finance (Citi) "When it comes to popular finance myths, cash hoarding by corporates may be one of the most perpetuated. ...What's misguided is the narrative, in our view, in particular among equity investors. What we most take issue with is the implication that corporates have lots of cash to return to shareholders. Indeed, there's plenty of data to the contrary that challenges the prevailing notion that corporates are the picture of good health." Citi Research Fred Hickey Is Shorting Tech Stocks (Business Insider) Tech stock expert Fred Hickey made a rare bearish call on Twitter saying, "for the first time in a long time, I have begun to short big-cap techs. Despite money printing rally, techs have rolled over â€“ for good reasons." He went on to says that he will "NOT be pressured into buying tech stocks in a dangerous, unsustainable Fed-induced rally. Stop the wise cracks." Hickey said he will have all the details in a note next week.Affluent Investor Confidence Rises In March (Spectrem) The Spectrem Affluent Investor Confidence Index (SAICI) which looks at investment confidence in household with over $500,000 in investible assets hit an 11-month high.

JCPenney is raising its prices in order to mark them down again, James Covert at The New York Post reported. CEO Ron Johnson is trying to restore traditional sales at the struggling department store chain. Last year, he vowed to wean customers off coupons, but the strategy failed and traffic plunged, leading to painfully low sales numbers. "Somewhat oddly, this shows that JC Penney's products were priced pretty fairly," Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions, told us. "However, it was the marketing and entrenched mindset of the consumer that led to an epic failure of the strategy." JCPenney said that the move gives customers more motivation to come into stores. "While our prices continue to represent a tremendous value every day, we now understand that customers are motivated by promotions and prefer to receive discounts through sales and coupons applied at the register," JCPenney spokeswoman Daphne Avila told Reuters. For example, a t-shirt that had an "everyday" price of $5 is now $6, which allows JCPenney to offer a bigger discount. It's a very common tactic in retail. "Mark-up to mark-down is a pricing strategy whereby retailers set regular merchandise prices high and then turn around to offer customers discounts," explained Panos Mourdoukoutas at Forbes.Â "The policy has been working well for retailers, as it hypes consumer emotions, making them feel smart and talk to other consumers about it." The Post's sources explained that the prices were taken from old lists. One JCPenney insider said that a JCPenney department exec "just pulled that spreadsheet and went off those prices." The move goes against a lot of Johnson's previous rhetoric. Natalie Zmuda at AdAge points out that Johnson said in early 2012 that his former boss Steve Jobs would've called JCPenney's promotions "insanity." "At some point you, as a brand, just look desperate," Johnson said last year. Well, there you go.
Christina AvraamOfficials are doing everything they can to prevent capital from fleeing Cyprus after the country's banking sector melted down. George Iordanou, a Cypriot PhD Candidate at the University of Warwick whose bank protest photos we ran earlier this week, says the country already has a much larger problem on its hands: people themselves are already planning to leave.Â  He told us via email that two of the most popular private schools are already struggling to fill spots, though it was not immediately clear when the schools, Grammar and Pascal, began accepting applications. In any event, he writes, brain drain seems imminent: Many people are planning to leave the country. I live in the UK and I have gotten various calls from people asking for my help - whether it is easy to get a job, a house and so on. My response was that they shouldn't come to the UK without a job since the cost of living is substantial and their chances of getting Â a job are not very favourable. Those who have degrees from UK universities seem to be more inclined to leave, although this is a totally empirical observation. Australia is a very popular destination. For some reason everyone talks about Australia. Not about specifics - e.g. work visas and so on - rather it being an attractive option.Â  He also says a top advertising firm in Nicosia has just let go half its workers. He declined to name the firm to protect a colleague's identity.Â  The good news, he says, is that daily life has actually been rather normal, at least for now. There's been no panic buying, though he adds that may be because cash withdrawals have been restricted. Â  But everyone remains worried: People seem not to have understood what is to follow. We are all stressed and anxious and we have a theoretical idea of what is coming (poverty and sharp decline in our standard of living) but these remain abstract concepts. I guess reality is going to hit soon. Thursday is going to be scary.
Eike Batista is in trouble. The Brazilian billionaire who once said that he would become the richest man in the world is now fighting for his fortune — and he has plenty of people out there wagering that he will fail. According to Bloomberg, shares on loan for his flagship oil company OGX jumped to 267 million this week. That means 21% of the shares of Batista's company are currently borrowed. That means investors could be shorting 21% of his company's shares right now. It's a dire situation to be sure, but Batista, ever full of swagger, has said that those betting against his empire are just spreading rumors and gossip and would eventually be “caught with their pants down." The numbers tell another story. Personally, Batista has lost $6 billion in the last year, meandering on and off Bloomberg's list of 100 richest billionaires. Forbes called him 'the biggest loser of the year,' calculating that he lost $2 million an hour in 2012. Forbes and Bloomberg disagree as to whether his net worth in total has fallen $19.4 billion (Forbes) or a whopping $26 billion (Bloomberg) over the past year. Worse yet, are the reports that he's facing collateral calls from creditors. From Bloomberg: Among Batista’s biggest creditors is Sao Paulo-based Itau Unibanco Holding SA, with about 5.5 billion reais ($2.8 billion) in loans outstanding, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Batista borrowed about 4.8 billion reais from Banco Bradesco SA and 1.6 billion reais from Grupo BTG Pactual, not counting a credit line of $1 billion BTG provided earlier this month, the people said. The BTG deal was spearheaded by Andre Esteves, a legendary Brazilian banker who guided BTG from a $2.5 billion investment bank to a powerhouse worth $15.4 billion. Esteves said he would be taking care of Batista's finances, but even that hasn't calmed investors. Batista is still getting massacred. To understand why and how, you have to understand how his empire is structured. Batista owns 6 companies trading on Brazilian stock exchange Bovespa's Novo Mercado, the section for companies that have achieved the highest standard of corporate governance. All 6 companies are controlled under umbrella firm EBX (all Batista's companies end with X to symbolize multiplication). They are: The company that's really getting pounded is OGX. Its stock has plunged 85% over the year, and bondholders have started feeling skittish as well (OGX bonds due 2018 fell to a record low last week). This all because last month OGX revealed that it missed production targets by 25%, and lost $142 million in Q4. Now the company has decided to cut the size of its only producing oil field, according to Bloomberg. It is, however, still planning to make over $1.3 billion of investments this year and has about $1.6 billion cash on hand. That said, according to the FT, investing in the company may not be enough. The problem is that Batista's talk isn't living up to EBX's walk. “He hasn’t delivered on his promises and the market has got tired of it,” says Pedro Galdi at SLW brokerage in São Paulo... As a conglomerate of mainly start-up companies, already weakened by a global funding squeeze, EBX relies on the good will of the market, says Oswaldo Telles at the BES Espírito Santo bank in São Paulo. “It is essentially a group of ideas, not of businesses – there is no business that is ready and generating cash,” he says. That's why, after the collateral call news came out, Batista announced that he would sell a part of his stake in MMX to raise some cash. He personally has a 54% stake in the company. MMX has seen better days too, though. Two CEOs have left the company in less than 2 years, and it was recently handed a $1.86 billion fine for unpaid taxes, according to the FT. Wikimedia CommonsHotel GloriaAnd there are smaller worries. Improvements to Batista's luxury Rio de Janiero hotel, Hotel Gloria are behind schedule and may not be ready for the 2014 World Cup. The billionaire does have some bright spots on the horizon though. He's doing a maritime equipment deal with BP, and more importantly, LLX, his logistics and infrastructure company has had a banner year. The stock rallied 19% in the last month and the company just scored a contract to build off-shore drilling structures with Brazilian state oil company Petrobras. Of course, Petrobras has its own problems. So the pressure is on for Batista to turn his entire empire around, and fast — not just because he said he would be the richest man on the planet, and not just because (as he's always said) he sees himself as a soldier responsible for bringing Brazil's success to the world. It's because Batista will automatically lose a chunk of EBX if he doesn't perform. No one knows yet how much. Last year, he sold over 5% of EBX preferred stock (worth around $2 billion) to Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Development Company. As part of their "strategic partnership" Batista agreed to return over 5% annually, or forfeit an unknown amount of his company in 2019, according to Bloomberg. Perhaps it's time to sell one of his three jets, or maybe one of his two yachts. These are desperate times.
Currently the Federal Reserve is using unemployment rate and inflation rate thresholds to guide monetary policy.  Specifically, the Fed says it expects to keep monetary policy easy as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and the inflation rate is below 2.5 percent. In a presentation given at the Global Interdependence Center conference in Dubai, David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors presented a chart tracking the Phillips curve (Simply put, the Phillips curve is the relationship between unemployment and inflation.  According to the theory, a low unemployment rate is correlated with a higher rate of inflation.) As you can see, the path has been quite volatile. Some attribute the surge in energy prices as tipping the economy into recession in late 2007, which would explain the lower right corner of the chart.  And as unemployment rose, prices fell, which is in line with the Phillips curve theory. And while curve is much closer to the Fed's threshold, it still has a ways to go. Here's Kotok's commentary: Slide 12 tracks the Phillips curve, or inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation rate. The concept was introduced to me by Thomas Synnott, a colleague at the National Business Economic Issues Council (NBEIC). Synnott uses the tracking system shown, with monthly data points. He describes it as an “under-damped oscillatory system.” The idea is to show the difference in shifts in duration, slope, and composition of the Phillips curve. One can see the pre-crisis levels in blue, the shift during the crisis in red, and the current green expansion period, through February 2013. The Fed’s target is marked with an “X.” Clearly there is a large gap between the current situation, in February 2013, and the Fed’s targets of 6.5 percent for the U3 unemployment rate and 2.5 percent for the inflation rate. Again, if we were to use the U6 in this curve instead of the U3, the gaps would be much more extreme. Cumberland Advisors
AP ImagesStephen PeyserPeople are talking about Goldman equity trader Stephen Peyser, who is also a professional lacrosse player. He's mentioned in a Bloomberg News article about how his former Johns Hopkins classmate, pro-lacrosse player Paul Rabil, is tapping into his Wall Street network to build his brand and the sport's image.  Wall Street firms have a habit of hiring lacrosse players. Just last year, Bloomberg Businessweek published a story about the "lacrosse mafia" linking a bunch of people in finance to the sport. Since Peyser, 26,  works in finance and plays professionally we decided to learn more about him.  He should definitely be included in our hot-shot Wall Street athletes list in the future.  Pesyer, who is 6-foot-2 and weighs 215 lb., plays for the Long Island Lizards in the Major Lacrosse League. Before that, he played in the NLL for the NY Titans.  During undergrad, he played midfield for Hopkins and helped the team win two NCAA national championships. He graduated from Hopkins in 2008.    We also learned that he likes to eat avocados, enjoys skiing and that his brother Greg also works in finance and plays lacrosse professionally. Before joining Goldman, he worked at JPMorgan Chase, FINRA records show.  Check Peyser out below when he was at JHU:  
The Cyprus stock market once had a good run. Opened in 1996, it reached as high as 5,500 points in the fall of 2007. That was just before the country entered the Eurozone. But right now the Cyprus market is closed indefinitelyÂ as a result of the country's financial meltdown. And as soon as it reopens, it will restart one of the greatest wipeouts in market history, as TD Securities' Richard Gilhooly notes in an email sent to clients. The market's already fallen 94 percent since the Greek crisis began three years ago. Right now, the market trades around 100.Â Here's the chart showing the collapse since 2008: Bloomberg.comÂ  Even before Lehman, the CSE had already fallen back to 3,300 points by Summer 2008. Gilhooly says when trading restarts, it could instantly fall another 50 percent, and something larger is not out of the question. "The size if the market is tiny, but could still offerÂ insights into the total damage inflicted on the island economy," Gilhooly said in a note. "For reference, Iceland fell 95% from peak to trough by March 09." Gonna get ugly.
REUTERS/ Bart MaatJeroen DijsselbloemLet me preface this by first saying that by no means would I consider myself a Euro apologist. I think the Euro crisis has been poorly handled from the start, and that the latest period of calm is nothing short of a farce, only thanks to the European Central Bank’s efforts to do “whatever it takes” to save the Euro, back in July 2012. But an end might be in sight for the Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis – and it’s not an exit that anyone has been looking towards. The past few days have been mired by endless speculation over the precedent the bailout of Cyprus might set for other peripheral countries. After all, the Euro project is about equality and unity; and given the progression of the crisis, we know that each step has set the precedence for the next step. That is to say, the Cypriot bailout – one which looped in depositors to take the fall for banks’ poor investing (gambling) decisions – is now considered a “template” for the rest of Europe. By now, everyone has recycled the fact first brought to light by The Economist in this week’s issue: of the 147 financial crises since 1970, none of them resulted in depositors taking losses before Cyprus, according to the IMF. This is a unique case indeed.  But is it really a unique case? Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem seems to disagree. In a revealing joint-interview with the Financial Times/Reuters yesterday, Mr. Dijsselbloem said that: “We should start pushing back the risks. If there is a risk in a bank, our first question should be: “Ok, what are you the bank going to do about that? What can you do to recapitalise yourself?” If the bank can’t do it, then we’ll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders. We’ll ask them to contribute in recapitalising the bank. And if necessary the uninsured deposit holders: “What can you do in order to save your own banks?” So then Cyprus is not a unique case, it is the “blueprint” (another one of Mr. Dijsselbloem’s carefully chosen words) for future bailouts. The Euro has been hit quite hard as a result of this comment, falling from just under $1.3000 against the US Dollar into the mid-$1.2800s in a few hours on March 25. Everyone, including myself, was focusing on the latter half of the quote: those uninsured deposit holders would join their constituents as candidates to recapitalize a downtrodden bank.  I posited this morning that “The big question now: if you have over €100,000 in a country whose banking system is on life support, do you feel that your money is safe?” This was a direct reference to Italy and Spain, the two countries closest to the core affected by the debt crisis. Mainly, I would be terrified if my savings were past the €100,000 threshold – news broke today that a Swedish EU member of parliament was setting forth legislation that would put uninsured deposit holders (over the said €100,000 threshold) on the chopping block ahead of tax payers for bailout proceedings. This is a big deal in the short-term, but maybe not in the long-term. On second glance, the main point that everyone should be taking away from Mr. Dijsselbloem’s comments is the first part of the sentence, when he said “We should start pushing back the risks.” We need to go to the root of the crisis to understand where the risks are stemming from: the strong interrelationship between banks and their sovereigns. Banks buy sovereign debt, sovereigns invest in the banks – it’s an endless loop where each party has their hand in the other’s pocket as well. To truly end the European sovereign debt crisis, this strong interrelationship needs to be severed. A potential tax on uninsured deposit holdings is just the way to end it. Before Cyprus, when a bank needed bailouts, they would go to their sovereign for funds. The sovereign would recapitalize the bank, and in return, the sovereign would get an investment in the bank. With the European economy in the gutter, quite frankly, many banks’ losses keep piling up, putting further strain on the sovereigns, while the banks don’t see a true penalty; moral hazard. The public debt racks up, government revenues can’t keep up the pace to pay off their own debt, and voila: the sovereign needs a bailout as well. We’ve all been led to believe that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) would be the facility by which these sovereigns would receive emergency funding. But the ESM is derived from tax payer money, which in effect would mean that the connection between sovereigns and banks remains. Mr. Dijsselbloem said that “We should aim at a situation where we will never need to even consider direct recap.”Now, like in Cyprus, it’s clear that tax payers won’t contribute to bailouts going forward. Essentially, Mr. Dijsselbloem has placed deposit holders in front of the tax payers for bailouts. Risk is now diverted away from the sovereign – the severing begins. But why is levying a deposit tax, if you will, the right move? In short, depositors are the life blood of a bank. Without depositors, the bank collapses. If a bank in a peripheral country is taking on extra risk to generate windfall profits – a quick and haphazard way of trying to cover holes in the balance sheet – it will be forced to curb its risk taking in order to shore up Tier 1 capital ratios, thereby preventing panic among its depositors. In the instance of a crisis on the sovereign level, banks with higher capital ratios could withstand the impact of sovereign debt writedowns, and the ‘Greek sovereign-Cyprus financial’ loop won’t happen again in the Euro-zone. Of course, to get to the end of the crisis now looks like a messy road – selling of assets to raise capital, which would likely put upward pressure on peripheral bond yields. The pace of raising capital could be quick, now that Mr. Dijsselbloem has seemingly fumbled his words, with many calling him ‘inept’ in his wake. Luckily, the ECB has its OMT safety net in place – the facility that has quite literally saved Italy and Spain – and with its key rate at 0.75%, it could easily slash 50-bps to cushion the economy amid balance sheet contractions.  There may be some words lost in translation, but Mr. Dijsselbloem is no idiot – he’s the President of the Eurogroup. I still believe that this crisis is going to get a lot worse – but I’m also considering the notion that Mr. Dijsselbloem may have unlocked the door to truly “pushing back the risks,” by changing the pace and direction of the Euro-zone crisis. Now that banks have skin in the game, the game is about to change.
The Boston Company Asset ManagementYesterday, Citi commodities analysts Seth Kleinman and Ed Morse declared that "the end was nigh" for oil demand.Â  They're not alone. Last month, the BNY Mellon's asset management subsidiary, the Boston Company, published a paper called "End of an Era: The Death of Peak Oil." AOL Energy's Peter Gardett pointed us to it. In brief, peak oil theory argues that oil production will peak, then fall sending prices surging. Ultimately, supply is unable to meet demand and prices become unbearable, sending the global economy to the edge. The team, led by Robin WehbÃ©,Â makes arguments similar to Kleinman and Morse's: the rise of natural gas as an alternative fuel to oil, combined with increasing fuel efficiency, is causing crude demand to sink. WehbÃ© and co. add that U.S. consumption has also become much more price elastic. They observe the following:Â  Team WehbÃ© decline to make a call on crude prices, and actually say they won't even necessarily go down.  Rather, they argue, the aforementioned trends will put an end toÂ supply-shortage-related price spikes: "...the likelier scenario is a gradual increase in global demand with ample sources and time for supply growth. Thus, we bid farewell to the days of Peak Oil." It was fun while it lasted.
Wall Street pundits talk about it all the time: corporations are sitting on record levels of cash. According to Moody's, non-financial corporations are sitting on around $1.5 trillion worth of cash. Bulls argue that this means companies could unleash this cash in the forms of capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks. However, Citi High Grade Credit Strategist Jason Shoup thinks this assessment is a bit short-sighted. "When it comes to popular finance myths, cash hoarding by corporates may be one of the most perpetuated," he says.Â  "What's misguided is the narrative, in our view, in particular among equity investors. What we most take issue with is the implication that corporates have lots of cash to return to shareholders. Indeed, there's plenty of data to the contrary that challenges the prevailing notion that corporates are the picture of good health." Shoup argues that we need to consider cash relative to other financial metrics. For example, he looks at cash relative to debt, which is considered a proxy for a company's a ability to service its liabilities. "That ratio is rapidly plunging and, at least to our minds, implies that further shareholder friendly behavior will likely be funded with more borrowing at the margin," he writes.

">RTIt's durable. It's portable. It's fungible. And it carries intrinsic value. Surely we're referring to gold and silver, ya? Nope. Gold and silver bugs have now transferred these arguments â€” the ones they used to insist Â that their metals were the only safe investment â€” to something seemingly gold and silver's antithesis: Bitcoin. Bitcoin is aÂ form of electronic cash designed to bypass financial institutions. It's created by computers, which "mine" for it by cracking preset algorithms. The biggest advocates of Bitcoin on the internet are folks that for a long time were non-stop touting gold and silver as the true forms of money that could be used to rebel against the existing regime. Max Keiser has pushed silver like crazy for years. He even advocated the notion that somehow if you bought silver, then you were harming JPMorgan. Another huge precious metal bug is the Canadian Jeff Berwick, who uses the monicker The Dollar Vigilante. Now both have gotten the Bitcoin bug and are pushign the merits of Bitcoin on their websites:Â  Huffington Post/Dollar Vigilante Asked if it could someday match silver or even gold prices, Keiser responded by email that Bitcoin could someday capture "between 1 and 10 percent" of the entire global currency market, which "implies a price of between $100k and $1 mn."Â  Bitcoin will thrive because itÂ helps merchants avoid banks, Liberty Blitzkrieg blog author Michael Krieger writes: I think it represents another way toÂ fight back against the current repressive and immoral monetary systemÂ that has a strangle hold on the planet. Â Â  And Zerohedge calls bitcoin "the only market that is open,"Â and it's become a huge subject on the site.Â Â  Bitcoin remainsÂ prone to hacks and technical glitches. But the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent weeks thanks to a variety of factors:Â the crisis in Cyprus, an announcement that the Treasury Department now seeks to regulate Bitcoin exchanges, and a spike in Bitcoin interest from Spaniards.Â  These days the price of gold and silver aren't doing much, and people have lost their obsession with it.
Jim Dyson/GettyJustin Bieber's popularity is hitting an all-time high around the world. Unfortunately, he/she is a sheltered adolescent surrounded by a fawning entourage and legions of highly-paid people whose job it is to tell him how great things are. And so, as you might expect, he seems to be losing his grip. The last few weeks have featured a raft of bizarre incidents involving the pop product, including shirtless meanderings through international airports, embarrassing Twitter rants, an alleged physical confrontation with a next-door neighbor and fist fights with the paparazzi in broad daylight. Justin's behavior is very much like what we've begun to see here in our own economy and stock markets. There is a giddiness with which any negative opinions or concerns are dismissed by traders and even the financial media. Much of the optimism is driven not by equity market valuations or by the economic growth picture. For the most part, investors have seized upon the housing recovery as their cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre, their rallying cry as more and more risk is taken across asset classes. I'd like to point you toward the following, from a MarketWatch story on IPOs: Real-estate and property offerings are up nearly 40% from last yearâ€™s rates to more than $14 billion. In a sign of the changing tide, two home builders, Taylor Morrison Home Corp. and TRI Pointe homes Inc., filed for IPOs at the end of 2012 â€” the first home-builder IPOs since 2004. Companies such as Enova International, Nationstar Mortgage (a stock thatâ€™s up 150% during the last year), Homeloan Servicing Solutions and even Ally Financial registered for follow-on offerings in the fourth quarter, according to Ernst &amp; Young. Last week, Aviv REIT Inc. , a sort of double play in that it finances long-term skilled-nursing facilities, priced an IPO that raised $264 million and gained 14% its first day in the market. Another real-estate offering, Five Oaks Investment Corp, which invests in residential-mortgage-backed securities, raised $61 million. And more are on the way. American Residential Properties, a REIT specializing in single-family properties, just filed for an offering raising up to $300 million. More from the Wall Street Journal: Enthusiasm for housing-related IPOs has spread beyond builders. Realogy Holdings Corp, owner of real-estate-agent brands such as Century 21, has surged since its October offering. Shares ended Friday 55% above their IPO price. Since its IPO Dec. 14, Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp, which acquires and leases single-family homes, has climbed 6.1%, almost double the 3.3% rise for the S&amp;P 500 over that time. And I''m sure I don't need to post a chart of the homebuilding stocks over the last few years. The industry's shares have essentially outperformed everything in sight. No one is saying the ebullience is completely unjustified, only that the optimism may be way ahead of where it should be. There's a turning point in every superstar's career where the fame and fortune begin to poison what made that star likeable and bankable to begin with. An oversaturation combined with superfluous amounts of attention and adulation. The same can be said for any investing or economic trend once it capture's the public's fancy. I fear that bullishness surrounding the US housing recovery may be racing toward that turning point way too quickly, in an unsustainable trajectory that bears watching. Slow down Justin, slow down housing bulls.

CNBCArt Cashin's note today is particularly conspiratorial. Cashin, UBS Financial Services' director of floor operations, addresses a rumor going around that the government has been beefing up its arsenal. Where Are Those Black Helicopters Heading? â€“ For weeks and weeks the blogosphere has been on fire with stories about massive purchases of ammo and weapons by Homeland Security.Â  The questions raised are now morphing into the main stream media and even some Wall Street watering holes.Â  A few members of Congress have begun to raise questions. If you haven't yet heard any of this, here is one of the less incendiary references by our pal and fellow street veteran, Jim Brown in Monday's Premium Investor: You may have seen the news stories on Homeland Security ordering 1.6 billion rounds of ammo, 7,000 machine guns and 2,700 armored personnel carriers for delivery later this year. At the height of the Iraq war the military was only using 5.5 million rounds a month and there were 500,000 soldiers. Those 1.6 billion rounds would fuel a war of that size for 30 years. They recently put out an "emergency order" for riot gear, body armor and "bullet proof checkpoint booths." What are they preparing to defend? Why are all the orders being placed on an "emergency" basis? Responses from Homeland Security, at least the ones I've seen, have been rather vague.Â  That tends to fan the flames rather than dispel the rumors. Friends who are hunters and gun club members tell me that the best investment over the last twelve or sixteen months was probably rifle ammunition.Â  They claim the price has doubled and almost tripled.Â  So far, there is no ETF that I know of. There have been reports of guns and ammo selling out.Â  But this has largely been attributed to the prospect of tighter gun control laws.
Instagram/oscarellyspittLike Western democracy, Socratic philosophy, written histories, epic poetry, and every other foundational pillar of high culture, spring break began in ancient Greece. Called "Anthestreria" by the local teens, and their parents, it was a festival dedicated to Dionysus, the god of wine and whoopee and just about every excuse to party. For three days, people would dance, singers would perform, women would deck themselves with flowers, and Greek men would compete to see who could be the fastest to drain a cup of red wine. Two thousand years later, practically nothing has changed except our taste in chugging alcohol. While Anthestreria is immortalized in terracotta wine vessels in world-class museums (below), you might think today's spring break rituals are as easily forgotten by history as they are by memory-blighted college students. But for the American cities that host students, the impact is not so brief, as John Laurie explained in his fascinating economic study Spring Break: The Economic, Socio-Cultural and Public Governance Impacts of College Students on Spring Break Host Locations. The paper begins, as spring break did, in Greece, before the rise of Christianity put an end to kylix head-stands and other childish things for two thousand years. It wasn't until the mid-twentieth century that modern spring break emerged. In 1934, Sam Ingram, a Colgate College swim coach, was looking for a warm place to keep his swimmers in shape. He chose the small, quiet town of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. More swimming instructors followed. During World War II, rich Ivy League students, who occasionally visited Bermuda during their spring breaks, were suddenly spooked by rumors of German U-Boats roaming the Caribbean. The best intracontinental alternative was to meet up with the swimmer co-eds in Florida. And so, Ft. Lauderdale became the first official home of the American Anthestreria tradition. The Spring Break EffectFast-forward six decades and, by the early 2000s, nearly 40 percent of college students travel en masse for spring break, spending "nearly $1 billion" in Florida and Texas alone, according to Laurie. In addition to the peculiar joy of reading a paper with these sort of topic sentences -- "Spring Break has a temporal as well as descriptive definition" -- it makes a substantive point about the economic benefits of spring break to the cities receiving hoards of boozing college students. The spring break effect is, in a word, meh. But how exactly do you measure "the spring break effect"? Laurie graphs sales taxes and hotel development taxes for various undergrad hotspots in Florida, Texas, and Arizona. His overall conclusions are: (1) Spring break can be great for some small businesses and bars that make their money selling cheap rooms and liquor on volume; BUT ... (2) It's not a dependable revenue generator for the counties at large, which suggests the economic benefits of the event are overrated, even for the most popular destinations; AND ... (3) The only local industry that is clearly and consistently stimulated by spring break is law enforcement. What Hath Spring Break Wrought? The Panama City StoryJust inside the armpit of Florida's panhandle, looking into the Gulf of Mexico, sits Panama City Beach, the "spring break capital of the world." Every year, the area draws up to 500,000 college students -- that's 42 co-eds for every city resident counted in the 2010 Census. For many years, Panama City has been MTV's home base for spring break coverage, and partiers spend $170 million during six-week period, according to a 2004 study. Sounds like quite the stimulus. But Laurie's research in Bay County (home to Panama City) found that "the sales tax collected in Bay County during the month of March is actually the lowest of any month" before ticking up in April. Here's the chart:  What about hotel taxes (i.e.: tourist development receipts)? It's a similar story. July is the year's clear winner. March and April, while a huge improvement over February, are hardly better than May or September.  Â  How is spring break so economically tame? Here are two conclusions, besides the possibility that Laurie's data simply does not properly reflect the benefits of spring break. First, college students are cheap and poor. They buy bad booze in bulk, they sleep five to a room, they lie out under the sun with nothing but alcohol and tanning lotion, and they hunt around for the best deals for dinner and accommodation, even if it means staying in a different city and driving to the beach every morning. Second, although the spring break effect is weak, it's still there. March and April are considerably more lucrative for Bay County than January and February. In defense of college students, maybe they don't spend as much money as the four-person families who fill out Florida over summer vacation, but they might pull forward the spring vacation season by a few weeks. If you're wondering how half a million people leave so little a mark, however, the proper response is that they do leave an unmistakable mark on local crime and non-criminal citations. March is by far the year's worst month for public safety in Panama City Beach.   The Spring Break Legacy"More crime than tax receipts" would be the five-word summary of the Panama City experience, as painted by Laurie's research. America's most famous spring break city is hardly an outlier. "The overall trend between cities regarding both average business sales tax and average hotel tax is that during Spring Break, [Florida, Arizona, and Texas] counties show low levels of sales tax collected," Laurie concluded. "In fact, the month of March is very poor for all three counties." It is notable that almost all of the cities in the paper saw extraordinary business and income growth in the mid-2000s. But since these years coincided with the heyday of the housing boom rolling through the sunbelt, it's reasonable to suggest that spring breakers might not have been the first (or 100th) most important factor in Florida's economic development. Perhaps the only conclusion to draw from the paper is one you could have guessed even if you knew nothing about Anthestreria, Bay County, or MTV. Spring break might be a boon to certain hotels and bars looking for late-winter pick-up. But it's hardly a metropolitan stimulus. It's hot, cheap, mid-semester jaunt for poor indebted college students living off bad beer, cheap grain alcohol, and hormones. These things are timeless. But upon them, great cities are not built.
Dow Jones has details of the new capital controls that Cyprus will impose on its banks when they re-open in order to prevent a full-fledged bank run. Capital controls are usually a last-ditch effort by policymakers to prevent market outcomes that seem unavoidable. In this case, confidence in Cypriot banks has been shattered in the wake of the financial crisis of recent days. Banks have been shut down since March 15, and depositors have had only limited access to their cash. It's become fairly obvious after seeing the lines at ATMs in Cyprus that depositors are trying to get that cash out as soon as they can. So, here is the Cypriot plan to try to mitigate that. Details come via Dow Jones: *Cyprus to Suspend Cashing of Checks, Allow Check Deposits -Officials *Cyprus Capital Control Decree Valid for 7 Days Starting Thursday -Officials *Cyprus Capital Control Measures Apply to All Accounts Irrespective of Currency -Officials *Cyprus Capital Controls Apply To All Banks, Not Just Those Involved In Bailout -Officials *Cyprus to Cap All Card Transactions at EUR5,000 Per Person, Per Month -Officials At any rate, it certainly doesn't sound like fun for depositors in Cypriot banks.
Courtesy of The Daily ShowThree years after enactment of the landmark legislation extending health care coverage to 27 million uninsured people, many in Congress and a majority of Americans are coming face to face with a daunting reality.  Consumers will face higher insurance premiums, insurers will see a 32 percent increase in medical claims costs, and almost everyone in the upper middle class or higher will pay a slew of new taxes.  The projected 32 percent hike in medical claims, based on a new report out Tuesday, is the latest bit of bad news for President Obama’s signature health care reform law. That’s likely to boost premiums for at least some Americans purchasing individual plans as the health care reform law continues to take hold. Millions of now-uninsured people will be covered as the market for directly purchased insurance more than doubles with the help of government subsidies. But costs will rise because spending on sicker people and other high-cost groups will overwhelm an influx of younger, healthier people into the program. The report by the Society of Actuaries could turn into a big headache for the Obama administration at a time when many parts of the country remain skeptical about the Affordable Care Act. The Senate’s vote last week to strike down a new sales tax on medical devices was a feel-good measure directed at manufacturers but with no  practical effect. As an amendment to the fiscal 2014 budget, the repeal lacked the weight of law. The 79-to-20 vote did signal growing displeasure among Republicans and Democrats alike with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act and the $1 trillion of new taxes it will generate over the coming decade. Many legislators and voters alike oppose the law, even while strongly supporting some of its provisions – such as allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26 and requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide insurance. MEDICAID EXPANSION While much of the controversy over health care reform has centered on Medicaid expansion efforts and an “individual mandate” to  force the uninsured to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, the impact of the new tax provisions on businesses and individuals has begun to attract more attention. Congressional Republicans have repeatedly called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that its new rules and taxes will have a “devastating” effect on the health care industry and could push the economy back into a recession. Freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., offered an amendment to the Senate budget last week that would overturn the health care reform legislation– the 36th time that a Republican has introduced such a measure in the chamber. The Democratic-controlled Senate defeated the Cruz amendment, but the GOP-controlled House recently approved its version of the 2014 budget with a provision to eliminate Obamacare. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., warned the law will add more than $1.2 trillion in spending to the federal balance sheet in the next decade while imposing onerous taxes on businesses and individuals to pay for it. “The Affordable Care Act, with insurance exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion, accelerates the trend of ever-increasing marginal tax rates on lower income individuals,” he said in his budget document. Ryan’s budget touched off a flurry of competing views and false claims about the law’s set of taxes. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., declared that there’s “$1 trillion in middle-income tax increases” in Obamacare. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, responded on a Sunday talk show that “there are not $1 trillion in taxes in Obamacare,” calling Johnson’s claim “completely untrue.” Both lawmakers were wrong. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the new law will generate $1 trillion of new tax revenue between 2013 and 2022, contradicting Wasserman Schultz’s assertion. As for Johnson’s claim about taxes largely falling on the middle class, liberal and conservative experts agree that the new taxes target high-income taxpayers, employers who fail to provide health care to their employees, and health care companies, including drug and medical device manufacturers and insurance providers. EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE AS INCOME According to Paul N. van de Water, a senior fellow and health care expert at the liberal leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the new health and tax policies will “significantly strengthen our nation’s economy.” “Some provisions will encourage consumers to be more cost sensitive in purchasing health insurance and health care services,” he said in recent testimony. “Among these provisions are the inclusion of the cost of employer-sponsored health coverage on W-2 forms, the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage, and limitations on the use of tax-advantaged accounts to pay for health-related expenses.” Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that if anyone is disproportionately nicked by the health care reform law, it is wealthier individuals and families. “Certainly the big taxes – the ones that bring in the most money – are clearly aimed at people with incomes over $250 K or $250 K,” Antos told The Fiscal Times. A good example is a measure that will broaden the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) tax base for high-income earners.  Under the current law, salaried workers pay a tax on their wages to support the Medicare hospital trust fund, but wealthier people with substantial interest income or dividends do not pay HI taxes on that income. The Affordable Care Act will raise the tax rate by 0.9 percent from the current 1.45 percent on married couples filing jointly who make more than $250,000 a year and unmarried taxpayers earning more than $125,000 a year. That measure alone will raise $318 billion in new tax revenue over ten years, according to CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation – or nearly a third of the overall tax increases called for in the legislation. Beginning in 2018, the new law will also impose a 35 percent excise tax on employer-provided health plans that exceed $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.  Currently, there is no limit to the tax deductions employers can claim for providing health insurance to their workers. This new provision – designed to raise $111 billion over ten years – would  be a roundabout way of imposing a cap. It also would discourage employers from offering their workers more expensive insurance policies.  The law also requires insurers to spend between 80 and 85 percent of every premium dollar on medical care, rather than on administrative costs and advertising. If insurers exceed that, they have to rebate the excess to their customers. Insurers are expected to rebate $1.1 billion this year alone, according to one report. Antos said the impact of penalties or new taxes on insurers is hard to assess because their “reaction ultimately is to spread any additional costs [they incur] over the insured population.” Once the law is fully implemented, it is expected to generate $55 billion in penalty payments from the uninsured individuals and $106 billion of penalty payments from employers over the coming decade, according to the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation.    More from The Fiscal Times:
flickr / fairlybuoyantEuropean bank stocks are getting slammed today as fears over the Cyprus precedent take hold across the euro zone. In Italy, Monte dei Paschi is down 5.3 percent, Banco Poplare SC is down 4.4 percent, andÂ Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna andÂ Banca Popolare di Milano are both down 4 percent. BofA credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen flagged Italian banks as most at risk in the wake of the Cyprus deal. Spain is getting hit too, though â€“ CaixaBank is down 3.7 percent, Banco Popular EspaÃ±ol is down 3.5 percent, Santander is down 2.4 percent, and Bankinter is down 2.3 percent. Even the biggest French banks â€“ BNP Paribas and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale â€“ are down 3 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. It's pretty clear what markets are taking away from the Cyprus bailout deal, which forced haircuts on uninsured deposits as a way to help pay for the rescue: the carte-blanche bailout regime in Europe may be over, and markets may have to reprice other European banks accordingly. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said as much in an interview with Reuters and the FT on Monday: But he said that investor skittishness could ultimately make the financial sector healthier since it would raise the cost of financing for unsound banks. "If I finance a bank and I know if the bank will get in trouble, I will be hit and I will lose money, I will put a price on that," Mr Dijsselbloem said. "I think it is a sound economic principle. And having cheap money because the risk will be covered by the government, and I will always get my money back, is not leading to the right decisions in the financial sector." Of course, many of these banks have also had a pretty good run in the past few months as part of the broader rally in risk assets that has swept across the developed world, so this could just be a bit of a correction at work as well.
YouTubeA friend of mine lost his job at [put in super high-powered internet company]. He had already been â€œwarnedâ€ and whatever else they do when aÂ bureaucracyÂ wants to slowly fire you. They tied him up to a chair and poured whip cream on him and let a rabid dog lick it off. That sort of thing. He had to turn in his â€œbadgeâ€ and they changed his passwords. I felt bad for him but we both knew he was miserable at the job. He IMed me the next day: â€œHow can I learn poker?â€ He wrote, â€œSince I have a lot of time to spare I figured I should learn poker. Do you have any tips on this?â€ The answer is yes: I once spent 365 straight nights playing poker. I barely slept. During the day I would study the game. Videos and books. The day my first daughter was born I left the hospital to play poker. In the summer I got myself a place in Atlantic City and I would take a helicopter down each weekend. I would play for 36 straight hours and come back. I went to Las Vegas whenever I could. I played in all the underground clubs in the city. â€œDo you want to learn poker to have fun or to make a living?â€ He said, â€œto make a livingâ€. Me: Are you a game player? Him: Yeah Me: I mean, are you in the top 99.9% of either scrabble, chess, backgammon, Go, or Bridge? Him: I play scrabble. Me: Does that mean you are a tournament player of scrabble? Him: I beat my friends and family all the time at scrabble. Me: Do you know what â€œstemsâ€ are? Him: It sounds familiar but I donâ€™t think so. Me: Then you donâ€™t know how to play scrabble. Stems are six letter combinations of the most popular letters that if you add a seventh letter you will most likely have a legal 7 letter word. For instance, â€œSATINEâ€ is the best stem. Example: add â€œEâ€ to â€œSATINEâ€ and you get ETESIAN. Add â€œXâ€ to SATINE and you get SEXTAIN. And so on. SATINE, SATIRE, RETINA are the three most popular stems. But you need to know the top 15 or so popular stems. Do you know the Q without U words? Like QAT QOPF QI QANAT? Do you know all the 3 and 4 letter J words? Him: No. Iâ€™ve never studied a game per se. I just play games. Me: Ok, you canâ€™t learn poker yet. Him: Can I learn scrabble and poker simultaneously? Me: No, you will lose all your money at poker AND you wonâ€™t have fun doing it. Scrabble, or chess, or backgammon, or POKER takes thousands of hours of intensive study. With scrabble, for instance, you need to learn all of the tricks above, plus rack skill, the endgame, theÂ psychologyÂ of it. The statistics, etc. And then you need to play other hard-core players and beat them. Then you can learn poker. The reason I am saying this is that to learn poker thereâ€™s actually four things to learn. 1) you need to learn how to learn games 2) then you learn poker 3) you need to learn how to be a stone-cold killer. The psychology of the game. i.e. you need to learn what it feels like to lose a lot. A LOT. 4) for poker: you need to learn about money. When you lose money itâ€™s a different psychology than just losing a game. Him: Ok, Iâ€™ll learn scrabble but are you sure I canâ€™t learn poker at the same time? I know how to play already and I play a lot. Me: Â  In Texas Hold-em after the flop if you are four cards to a flush, what are your exact odds of getting a flush by the river? Him: [no response. ] Me: Donâ€™t look it up online. Whatâ€™s the answer. Him: [no response] Me: Thatâ€™s one statistic you have to learn. You have to learn 1000 of those statistics at least. And thatâ€™s before you even start playing and learning the psychology. Him: Where can I learn those statistics? Me: By learning scrabble first. Him: Ok, Iâ€™ll learn scrabble first. Me: It takes 1000s of hours to learn Scrabble. Every great poker player I know is a stone-cold killer. You have to kill or be killed. Most great poker players I know are great at all other games and have been since they were kids. A friend of mine spent 20 years becoming a chess master, another 5 becoming a great backgammon player, and it took him 10 years before he made a dime from poker. Now heâ€™s made about $5 million from poker. Everyone thinks heâ€™s a nice guy but when you meet him you also say to yourself, â€œthis guy is a hard core criminal.â€ Thatâ€™s what it takes. Him: I want to learn Me: learning a game teaches you how to be a killer you don't want to learn how to be a killer while you are losing money because that's a different skill you have to learn â€“ how to lose money better to first learn games. then learn about money this is a long way of saying: i dont think you should learn poker focus that time and energy on other things Him: [no response] â€“ One thing I didnâ€™t say: poker is not fun. It seems like itâ€™s a game but it isnâ€™t. You sit around a table of disgusting guys and everyone is laughing and trying to be friends but all you do is lie to each other and try to take each otherâ€™s money. Itâ€™s also boring. You have to play for 12 hours straight every day. And if you are good, maybe you get to play in 2 or 3 hands per hour if itâ€™s a full table. BORING. Another thing I didnâ€™t mention: time doesnâ€™t have to convert into just money. Figure out why you were miserable at your last job. The same things will cause you to be miserable at anything you do. There are exercises to be more calm and happy with life situations. Learning a game with the hope of making money while sitting around seldom works. Better to hug people. Better to make friends. Better to take a drawing class. To kiss someone. To eat well and sleep well and use your free time to get in shape. From this foundation will blossom new opportunities. This foundation will sit below the house you eventually live in. Donâ€™t waste it sitting around a smoky table with a bunch of people who will lie and steal from you. Be around people who love you. Love is the best way to flourish. â€“ Reading List:Â  â€œEverything Scrabbleâ€ by Joe Edley â€“ has all the stems, the Q without U words, 3 letter words, puzzles, psychology. â€œChessâ€ by Laszlo Polgar. Polgar is an interesting story. He had a theory about raising kids. Indoctrinate them at the age of 3 and home school them to be focused on one topic. His three daughters are the best female chess players ever. He also had a theory of chess learning. Many, many easy problems instead of few difficult problems. So his book is 5000 problems of varying skill. Anyone who gets through that book will be a chess master. â€œBackgammonâ€ by Paul Magriel â€“ the bible of Backgammon. But then I recommend Bill Roberts books starting with â€œBackgammon for WInnersâ€. â€œHold-em Poker for Advanced Playersâ€ by Sklansky. This is only the starting point with the basic stats. Then I would get books that go through hand-by-hand decision making. [Note: all of these books are just BOOK #1 to read to even get your foot in the door. Then there are many more after that to actually get good.] Better reading list:Â  â€œ10 Things to Do if You Were Fired Yesterdayâ€
Flickr / Eu Council EurozoneJeroen DijsselbloemEuropean officials – including Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem – have been making comments in the wake of the Cyprus bailout deal that have been more than a little unsettling for investors in European banks. Dijsselbloem sparked a controversy this week when he suggested in an interview with Reuters and the FT that the way banks were bailed out in Cyprus – specifically, the haircut to uninsured deposits as part of the restructuring process – could be the new way that the euro zone handles bank bailouts in the future. That would mark a radical departure from what has been the predominant approach in Europe since the start of the financial crisis – authorities ensuring depositors that they won't be at risk, and that their money is safe in banks across the currency area. BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Hans Mikkelsen thinks Dijsselbloem has given us a glimpse of the "end game" in the euro area – the eventual transfer of risk back from the taxpayer – which has been shouldering most of the weight of bailout efforts so far – back to those who loan money to the banks in question, through purchases of bank bonds and deposits in bank accounts. Fellow BAML analyst Richard Thomas says that because of this, at BofA, they "embrace a view that banks will never look the same post-Cyprus." After all, according to Thomas, "it is not reasonable to expect depositors to be able to distinguish between banks with strong and weak capital ratios but also – and perhaps more importantly – to be able to anticipate whom policymakers will deem worthy of rescue and who not." So, what happens next? Thomas, who has been a big proponent of the idea of a "Great Rotation" out of investor money out of fixed income funds and into equity funds in the United States, envisions something a little different going down in Europe. Thomas writes in a note to clients: Yet large depositors have clearly been put on notice that they should be careful where they invest. In our view, this could push larger sums out of the banking system into managed funds, e.g. money market funds or fixed income funds, and will likely spread deposits across a country’s banking sector at the insured level (which may be positive for risk assets). For the banks themselves, it underlines the work that they still have to do in terms of building capital buffers that will satisfy bondholders (and depositors) of the remoteness of the risk of their suffering any capital loss. This should mean more subordinated issuance over the next few years, in our view. However, Thomas is not so negative on the prospects for euro zone banks. "In terms of investible Eurozone banks," he says, "we reiterate our view that Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain have already been recapitalised and are already in programs which we doubt will be revisited any time soon." With those four banking systems addressed, Thomas flags Italy as the most relevant risk – but he says that "even our worst estimates" of how much Italian banks might need in a bailout amounts to only 5 percent of Italian GDP. Furthermore, since Italian banks have a lot of bondholders, Thomas doesn't see a scenario in which depositors would have to take a haircut, because there are enough bondholders to cushion the blow in a restructuring. There is, of course, Slovenia, which seems to be teetering on the edge of needing to ask for a bailout, and Thomas thinks that situation could cause a further deterioration in investor sentiment in the short term, "but this is Cyprus-like in its specificity and has little read-across arguably to the mainstream European banks," he writes. So, it's a different world now. Especially for depositors. The market has reacted pretty negatively to this realization so far, as European bank stocks have tumbled this week. Whether investors continue to dump them en masse or decide that the risks aren't as great as this week's selloff suggests remains to be seen.
CNBCAlmost everyone agrees that the U.S. housing market is making a big comeback. But some, like economist Robert Shiller, believe we're starting to see bubble-like mentality in certain local markets like Phoenix and Las Vegas. Florida is apparently "on fire" and California is seeing buying frenzies. Southern California Public Radio caught up with bond legend and long-time SoCal resident Jeff Gundlach. Gundlach says he is seeing a "buyer's panic" in the area as prospective buyers scoop up the limited supply. "People are fighting with other people," he noted, engaging in bidding wars in which houses go on the market and immediately receive dozens of offers. "It's almost the same type of environment I remember from the late 1980s," said Gundlach, a longtime Southern California resident. "People would be writing out offers on the roofs of their cars – and there would always be several cars lined up." He attributes the local mania to the low levels of housing starts and the Federal Reserve's extraordinary efforts to keep borrowing rates low. Read more at SCPR.org.
Reuters/Gary HershornThe pending home sales index fell 0.4 percent month-over-month (MoM) in February to 104.8. This missed expectations of a 0.3 percent decline.  Click here to refresh &gt; On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, pending home sales were up just five percent, missing expectations for a 8.7 percent rise. January's numbers were revised down to show a 3.8 percent MoM and 9.6 percent YoY rise. A regional breakdown shows that PHSI was up on a monthly basis in the West and Midwest, rising 0.1 percent to 101.4, and 0.4 percent to 103.6 respectively. It fell in the Northeast and South. In the former it was down 2.5 percent to 82.2, and in the latter it fell 0.3 percent to 118.8. Pending home sales slipped because of declining inventory. "Only new home construction can genuinely help relieve the inventory shortage, and housing starts need to rise at least 50 percent from current levels," said Lawrence Yun NAR chief economist in a press release. Pending sales is a "forward-looking indicator based on contract signings," as defined by NAR. We've already seen new home sales fell 4.6 percent in February, and existing home sales were up a modest 0.8 percent on the month in February. Tracking these figures on three and six-month averages gives us a better picture of the housing market.
MyStarfire.comForbes has a cover story on billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn who is sporting a more relaxed look these days complete with facial hair. One of the things Forbes reported was that "Icahn sold his 177-foot yacht because he got bored spending time on it; the investor has discovered that, for him, happiness means pursuing his activism actively."  That's right, he got bored of a ship with amenities such a as a helicopter pad, jacuzzi, gym and staff of twelve including a personal chef.  Back in 2008, Icahn put his yacht "Starfire" up for sale for $37.5 million, the New York Post reported. It's definitely a dream ship and now we're going to take a photo tour. 
Tiger Woods is back on top of his game, and as Matthew Futterman at WSJ notes, there's a fun comparison to be made between Tiger's career trajectory and that of the Dow Jones which is at all-time highs. Both the Dow and Tiger hit their low points in 2009, and have been climbing back since. But even if the connection between Tiger's career and the stock market is coincidental, it doesn't mean that Tiger Woods doesn't have an important message for people who care about the economy. Yesterday Tiger and his sponsor Nike came out with a new ad that, "raised eyebrows" in the media. nike People were annoyed because it states a matter-of-fact truth, that ultimately if you win tournaments and do good, then nobody cares about your past flaws or anything like that. Of course the message is 100 percent true, which is probably why it bothered people. But it extends beyond sports to economics. Back in 2012, at a conference put on by The Atlantic, Larry Summers said (HT: @conorsen): ...the single most important determinant of almost every aspiration the country has, whether it is healthy government finances, or rising wages for middle class families, whether it is reducing poverty, or whether it is maintaining leadership in the world, is the rate of growth of our economy over the next decade. And so, if we do not succeed in maintaining sustained economic growth, at a rate that puts a rising fraction of our population back to work, we will not succeed in anything else, including we will not succeed in repairing the government budget situation. And so maintaining a policy focus on assuring an adequate level of demand, and growth in demand, whether that means promoting exports, whether that means reforming and spending appropriately on infrastructure, whether that means appropriately design tax reform, is a critical issue. To put it another way: 'Growth Takes Care Of Everything." As we've said a bunch of times in the past, the only way to close the deficit is to grow. Nothing else will work. So you see: Winning/Growth Takes Care of Everything. If you really want to extend this further, watch this old Tiger Woods commercial from early 2010, near his low point where the voice of his deceased father talks to him about learning lessons from his collapse. That was what we were all talking about back then, learning the lessons of the crisis (Less credit! Less irresponsible consumerism! Learning our lesson!). But these days, we're just back to winning, and all that old hand wringing about fixing core fundamental problems has been forgotten about.  
Forbes' latest cover story is a huge spread on billionaire hedge fund manager, corporate "raider", and Wall Street legend Carl Icahn. The man's been hard to ignore lately. At the beginning of the year he joyfully jumped on the other side of long-time nemesis Bill Ackman's epic short position in Herbalife. Most recently, he's been mixing things up in the deal to take Dell private. Basically, he's everywhere. And the best part of this Forbes spread is that you find out exactly why. It's very simple. From Forbes: Icahn says he respects the new breed of activist investors like Meister, Daniel Loeb and Barry Rosenstein. (â€œGood guys,â€ he calls them.) But what separates him is that they run money that can be recalled by their investors. Icahn, by virtue of his postmeltdown revamp, wages proxy battles and issues tender offers with so-called permanent capitalâ€“money under his complete control. And given how large that permanent war chest is, he can target companies previously thought unassailable. â€œRight now,â€ says Icahn, waving around an aluminum ruler like a cavalry saber, â€œwithout selling anything, we can write a check for about $10 billion.â€ With that kind of ammo Icahn can take on a cash-rich company with a market cap of as much as $50 billion. That's why, for Icahn, a company like Dell is completely in play. He took a $1 billion position in the company after reading about the deal in the newspaper. Since then, he's told Dell's board he's interested in a controlling interest in the company. It's classic Icahn, with absolutely no compunction about taking the company Michael Dell founded in his college dorm room away from him. From Forbes: â€œMichael may have messed himself up,â€ says Icahn. â€œHe put himself in a position where he may lose his company, since normally it would have been very hard to take his company away, because he owns 15%.â€ For what it's worth, Icahn's investment funds have returned an average of 25% over the last four years, and he's up over 12% year to date. So perhaps Wall Street should just submit to its over-lord. Read the full piece at Forbes&gt;
The U.S. financial markets are often cited as the deepest and most liquid markets in the world. While this may be true on an absolute basis, it isn't so much relative to GDP. In a recent report, the McKinsey Global Institute charted the sizes of country stock and bond markets and measured it relative to GDP: To compare the size of financial systems, we calculate financial depth at the country, regional, and global levels. This is calculated by dividing the financial assets of a country or region, as defined above, by its GDP. There are large variations across countries, and in general countries with higher income levels have deeper financial systems (Exhibit A2). McKinsey Global Institute

SocGen's ultra-bearish analyst Albert Edwards has his take on Europe post-Cyprus. His prediction: Yes Europe is going to break up and yes, Cyprus is a worrisome template. The Troika have managed to exponentially increase concerns on how safe retail deposits are in the eurozone. It matters not that the final Cypriot bailout plan did not touch smaller savers unlike the original proposal of a 6¾% tax (haircut) for ALL deposits under <U+0080>100,000 in ALL banks (including foreign bank subsidiaries). The fact that this plan was originally sanctioned, despite deposit insurance, will have shaken small saver confidence to the bone. It certainly has shaken my confidence. I know from first-hand experience the extreme difficulty for a European citizen to open an account in another European country <U+0096> it is nigh on impossible for the man in the street. If <U+0091>Joe Sixpack<U+0092> in Spain or Italy or wherever is thinking the Troika are circling their country in the future, it is entirely rational, as Mervyn King suggests, to panic! (The Bank of England Governor, Mervyn King once said it was not rational to start a bank run but rational to participate in one once it has started.) But euro-Joe Sixpack is left with the choice of stuffing his money under the mattress or buying <U+0091>safe<U+0092> financial assets (maybe overseas mutual funds or gold?), or indeed spending the money on goods and services. Meanwhile, in a story posted by Deutsche Bank Bernhard Speyer raises similar points: The ramifications of this decision by the European institutions are no less serious, as it has undermined the agreement to create a banking union that they had just lavished themselves with praise for achieving. For by creating the impression that deposits are no longer safe as they strived to solve the financial problems of the Cypriot state, they have revived the vicious circle of fiscal and financial instability – the so-called “sovereign-bank nexus” – that the banking union is specifically designed to eradicate.  As became evident subsequently, it would have been possible to devise a bailout package that excluded small savers the first time around. Back when they rescheduled Greek government bonds the EMU states had already committed the “original sin” of stripping the aura of safety from an asset class previously regarded as secure – the negative repercussions of this decision are still apparent, although the policy was reversed subsequently. It is puzzling that the same mistake has been repeated with deposits that are insured.
There are a lot of things to worry about in Europe: Italian political chaos. Cyprus. The mouthing off of Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem. As such the Euro is hitting a 4 month low. FinViz SocGen's Sebastien Galy writes: We almost reached our first target of 1.28 in EURUSD, opening up the next level at 1.26, both levels driven by our models. It suggests a strategy of selling on short covering to target the new lower range with a bottom at 1.26. As a reminder our year end forecast goes into the 1.20s. Models have worked surprisingly well for eurusd (for us not our twin), the last short covering came close to 1.31 given by the 80 percent quantile model, though our traders nailed it perfectly with a call for 1.3050.
Flickr / alles-schulmpfThis is an interesting comment found in Greek newspaper Ekathemerini: “Thanks to political mismanagement, we now have a first: capital controls in the eurozone,” said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel in Brussels and a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “How long is temporary? It could turn out like Iceland, extending to many years.” Since the Cyprus deal last weekend, there's been a lot of talk about how in a sense Cyprus has already left the Eurozone. That's because in a regime where there's capital controls -- laws that prevent people from quickly moving their money out of a bank -- a euro in a Cyprus bank isn't worth what a Euro in a German bank is worth. You'd much rather have your money in a German bank, where there's no limits on withdrawals or transfers. If we're talking about capital controls for years, then that really means bad news for the 'Cypriot Euro.'
Most markets are pretty uneventful this morning, but Italy is sinking again. The Milan market is down about 1.1%. FTSE MIB The government continues to be in a state of chaos following the elections in late February, which failed to produce a winner.

Yesterday Ford CEO Alan Mulally said he was concerned about the weakness in the Japanese yen, the implication being that the diving currency is giving an advantage to competitors who can sell for less. This story is part of a broader meme, that there's a "currency war" going on, as various countries and their central banks attempt to manipulate their currency lower to boost exports. Since not everyone can be an exporter (exports are someone else's imports) and total global net exports always equal zero, the argument made by some is that the currency war is a zero-sum game that ultimately accomplishes little for the world, while destroying and weakening paper currency. Goldman Sachs is out with a big on the subject of 'Currency Wars' and one of the primary arguments made in there is that there isn't one going on. Instead, we're just seeing prudent monetary easing and the decline of real rates in some countries, which has, yes, resulted in weaker currencies. The prime examples are Japan and the UK, although the former has engaged in much more outright easing, while the latter has seen its currency fall due to rising inflation expectations and a decline in real rates, rather than anything special that the Bank of England is doing. The key argument from Goldman is not just that there isn't a currency war, but that what is going on is good for the world as a whole. It's not zero sum. Says Goldman's Kamakshya Trivedi: Rather than a “currency war” interpretation that implies offsetting winners and losers, monetary easing, even when it is competitive or non-cooperative, is not a zero-sum game. While the effect on any individual country is ambiguous, from a global perspective it is unambiguously expansionary; at the least, activity is boosted in the country implementing the easing, and, depending how exchange rates adjust, this boost may (or may not) be shared by other parts of the world; at the most, the easing in one country is matched by easing in another (leading to no change in the exchange rate), which is certainly expansionary on net for the world. This expansionary impulse should prove supportive for asset markets, especially risky assets such as equities. So perhaps it’s no coincidence that even as the focus on so-called currency wars has increased, major equity markets around the world have rallied, even where the currency hasn’t depreciated. To back up this idea that Japanese loosening isn't just some ploy to boost export oriented industries, Trivedi points to this chart which shows that during the great run of the Nikkei (the Japanese stock market) in recent months, it's the domestic-focus companies that have outperformed the exporters, which is not what you'd expect if the focus were just on yen depreciation. Goldman Sachs Bottom line. What we're seeing is classical monetary policy to boost domestic demand. There's no war and the whole world can benefit.
Some perspective on this blazing hot, can't-stop market from Dan Greenhaus at BTIG:  While everyone is focused on Cyprus and what they have to look forward to, it’s important to remind people that it will not be the last, tiny, seemingly meaningless country you’ll hear about. Slovenia, which as of January had no need “whatsoever” for a bailout, is starting to see its borrowing costs rise and increasingly being mentioned in press reports but our conversations with clients suggests zero tolerance for hearing anything about this. That might suggest to some complacency or a disregard of risks; maybe so. But as the first chart below illustrates, the S&amp;P 500’s 2013 gain still trails its 2012 gain over a similar time frame (+12.6% then v. 9.7% now), suggesting that maybe investors are accounting for risks in 2013 whereas they were not in 2012.

It's a pretty quiet day in markets, but one standout is silver, which is the one big fat red spot. It dove early this morning. Kitco
Shutterstock.com / Andriy MarkovIt's another quiet day in world markets. The big Asian markets, Japan and China, both ended pretty much flat. US futures are a hair higher. Europe isn't going anywhere. The Euro has dipped a bit this morning, but nothing too special. The big story continues to be the Cyprus fallout, although even that is having a limited to non-existent impact on the market.
Citi credit strategist Jason Shoup offers an interesting stat about corporate cash balances in a recent note to clients. "Using the Russell 3000 as a universe, we see that the top 20 corporates with the most cash on their balance sheets at the end of 2012 hold over $650 billion - almost 40% of all the cash and marketable securities of Russell 3000 companies," writes Shoup. "And among those top 20 companies, cash balances have grown between 15-20% for the last year, while the rest of the companies have seen far lower growth in the 0-5% range (see figure)." It gives you a sense of how skewed things can be in the financial markets. Citi Research
