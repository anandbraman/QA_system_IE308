REUTERS/Rick WilkingApple CEO Tim Cook spoke for the first time Thursday following the celebrity nude photo leak.Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Thursday night that the company will increase security on iCloud following targeted attacks that leaked nude photos of celebrities online. In the interview, Cook reiterated Apple's earlier statement that the attacks were targeted toward specific individuals. The hackers were able to use various methods to guess those indivduals' passwords. It was not a widespread hack of iCloud. As a response to the attacks, Apple plans to have new security updates to its iCloud and iTunes login system within two weeks. The updates will notify users directly on their devices whenever someone tries to access their account from a new, unregistered device or tries to change a password. Before, users only got an email. But while those notifications may be able to give users some time to alert Apple that someone could be trying to hack into their account, they still won't be able to stop the kind of attacks used to access iCloud data like photos.  To fix that problem, Cook said Apple will make improvements to its 2-step authentication security feature, a system that requires users to input a second code sent to another registered device in order to access an iTunes account. For example, users with 2-step authentication can get a push notification sent to their iPhone containing a unique secondary password when setting up an iTunes account on a new iPad for the first time. But 2-step authentication doesn't cover all aspects of iCloud, including photo storage. Cook said 2-step authentication will apply to iCloud when Apple releases iOS 8, its new mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads, in a few weeks. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Vincent WestThe mean incomes for all U.S. income brackets are still below 2007 levels according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. The Fed broke down the income brackets into three groups: the bottom 50%, the next 40%, and the top 10%.  From 2007 to 2010 all three groups saw mean incomes decrease. The downwards trend continued for the bottom 50% for the next three years, and the next 40% saw no significant change in either direction. While the top 10% continue to have incomes at lower levels than what they had in 2007, they saw a sharp surge from 2010 to 2013. Here's the graph: Federal Reserve The report also revealed the relationship between the median and mean incomes. In real terms, median income rose "steadily" from 1992 to 2007, fell from 2007 to 2010, and fell again from 2010 to 2013. On the other hand, mean income grew at a faster pace than median income since 1989. And every year mean income is above median income, which "reflects the concentration of income in the top of the income distribution", according to the video. The mean then rebounded from 2010 to 2013, but you can see that the median continued to decline. Federal Reserve You can watch a video of the report here. FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesIf you want good investment performance, forget you have an account. On this week's Masters in Business program on Bloomberg Radio, Barry Ritholtz talks with James O'Shaughnessy of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. Ritholtz and O'Shaughnessy spend much of their discussion talking about the ways people screw themselves when investing, because nothing gets in the way of returns quite like someone who thinks they have a great idea.  O'Shaughnessy discusses a number of interesting analyses he has done with regard to the length of holding periods (spoiler: the shorter you hold a stock, the more likely you are to lose money) among other things. But O'Shaughnessy relays one anecdote from an employee who recently joined his firm that really makes one's head spin. O'Shaughnessy: "Fidelity had done a study as to which accounts had done the best at Fidelity. And what they found was..." Ritholtz: "They were dead." O'Shaughnessy: "...No, that's close though! They were the accounts of people who forgot they had an account at Fidelity." There are numerous studies that explain why this happens. And they almost always come down to the fact that our minds work against us. Because of our behavioral biases, we often find ourselves buying high and selling low. Ritholtz also follows with some of his experiences in estate planning, where a family fighting over some inherited assets might not touch them for say 10 or 20 years while they work out the problem, and later find that those 10 or 20 years are the best period of performance. The absolutely terrible investment decisions that people make are something that just can't be emphasized enough.  We recently highlighted this chart from Rich Bernstein that shows just how terrible you are at investing: don't forget it.  Richard Bernstein Advisors FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Mike StoneFor a couple of years now, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said it is weighing the benefits of a proposed disclosure of political contributions by public companies. A new survey of CFA Institute members supports the idea of disclosure, but with some caveats. Interest in corporate giving gained following the US Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens Unitedcase, which ruled that corporations could contribute to political campaigns. According to opensecrets.org, donations in Congressional elections that year grew to $3.6 billion, nearly 50% higher than in 2008. Growth in spending on Congressional races grew just 0.6% between 2010 and 2012. The survey of randomly chosen CFA Institute members from the United States, which closed on 4 August, was conducted to determine whether CFA Institute members would support a disclosure requirement related to companies’ political and charitable contributions. This information already is publicly available for companies through websites such as opensecrets.org, which looks at political giving over a number of years. The responses from this survey, however, indicate that these disclosures aren’t sufficient. Investors want these gifts to be made part of the standard disclosures included in the Management Discussion &amp; Analysis that companies must provide as part of their year-end SEC filings. The respondents indicated they are not so troubled with companies contributing their — as in shareowners’ — money for political purposes so long it is properly disclosed. Of the 1,511 survey respondents — a 5% response rate with a +/- 2.5% margin of error — 60% said companies should be able to make political contributions; 70% agreed they should be able to make charitable contributions. Nevertheless and regardless of the type, the respondents said that companies should have to disclose those contributions. The preferred means of disclosure was the annual 10-K that public companies must file with the SEC. CFA Institute By comparison, just 27% of respondents said companies shouldn’t be allowed to make any political contribution (6% said they shouldn’t be able to make charitable contributions). And just 13% said companies should be able to make political contributions and not have to report them to shareowners (24% said the same about charitable gifts). Disclosures should go beyond mere tallies of contributions made, said respondents. A significant percentage — 88% — said the disclosures should include information about companies’ policies on political giving. Another 85% said they should name the organizations and/or causes that received the gifts. Portfolio managers comprised the largest contingent of members who responded, accounting for 21%, compared with 14% who said they were research analysts. At the same time, 43% of respondents have more than 20 years of experience in the investment business. Another 31% have between 11 and 20 years of experience. Shareowners have always wanted to know how companies and company executives are investing their money. That they are as interested in knowing about political giving is certainly a new twist on that old theme. FREE AppDownload

Multifamily Housing Is Booming, And It Doesn't Look Like A Bubble (CFA Institute) "The rebound in housing starts has been uneven between single-family and multifamily housing," writes David Schawel, CFA. "Single family has rebounded from a trough of ~400k annual starts to ~650k, but well below the peak of 1,800k in 2006. It’s a very different story in multifamily housing where housing starts are now at levels equal to or greater than pre-crisis at ~440k." "The strong rebound in multifamily housing is understandable from a number of perspectives," Schawel added. "A secular movement towards multifamily housing led by demographics and changing preferences is a trend going forward. Further aiding this shift in our domestic housing “mix” is the relative looseness in multifamily housing credit availability compared to single-family credit, which remains much tighter than pre-crisis times."

Just Because You Can Afford To Take A Risk Doesn't Mean You Should (Kitces.com) "The traditional approach to evaluating risk tolerance involves gauging a client's attitudes about risk, their financial capabilities to take risk and mixing them together into a composite score that can be assigned to a portfolio," says financial planning expert Michael Kitces. "Yet the fundamental problem with this traditional approach is that it confuses someone's capacity to take risk with their actual need or desire to do so." "The end result is that wealthy clients who don't want or need risk end out being given moderate growth portfolios anyway, young clients who have a long time horizon but no desire for risk end out with equity-centric portfolios that may scar them for life, and clients who have unrealistic spending goals end out with impossibly conservative portfolios doomed to fail," cautions Kitces.  The World's Attention Is On The Bond Market (The Felder Report) According to investment advisor Jesse Felder, the most important assets classes in the world is the 10-year US Treasury bond. "So far this year bonds have performed very well as this rate has declined – foiling the best laid plans of all the bond bears (and there have been loads of them)," Felder writes.  "But the bulls can’t quite plan their victory parade just yet because right now this critical interest rate is sitting at a critical technical level, a crossroads, actually," says Felder. "The downtrend for this rate is well-established. It might be the longest tenured trend, in fact, of any major asset class out there right now." FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/U.S. Air Force photo/Randy Gon/Handout  ">Thomson ReutersAn F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter takes off on a training sortie at Eglin Air Force Base, FloridaBy Randall Palmer, David Ljunggren and Andrea Shalal OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada is likely to choose between two major U.S. firms when it buys a new fleet of jet fighters, excluding two European competitors, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 stealth fighter and Boeing Co's F-18 E/F Super Hornet were deemed more suitable for the variety of tasks the military has laid out. That would mean the exclusion of Dassault Aviation SA's Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, jointly made by BAE Systems PLC, Finmeccanica SpA and Airbus Group NV. The fighter selection has proven enormously problematic for Canada's Conservative government, which in 2012 scrapped a sole-sourced plan to buy 65 F-35s for C$9 billion ($8.3 billion) after a parliamentary watchdog savaged the decision. Ottawa then set up a special secretariat to compare the merits of the four contenders. It is deciding whether to hold a competition or go ahead with the initial plan to buy F-35s, which would likely prompt accusations that it was acting in bad faith. Polls show the Conservatives of Prime Minister Stephen Harper could lose the next federal election, which is set for October 2015. The source said that while the F-35 had scored well on the various tests laid out by the secretariat, the Super Hornet was almost as capable and had the advantage of being cheaper. The secretariat was not asked to make a recommendation about which jet to buy. A spokeswoman for Public Works Minister Diane Finley, who has day-to-day responsibility for military procurement, said ministers were reviewing a number of reports, including information on fighter capabilities, industrial benefits, costs and other factors. "Until a decision is taken, all options remain on the table," Alyson Queen said for the minister. The $400 billion F-35 program, the largest in Pentagon history, is already late and well over budget. U.S. officials said on Wednesday they were nearing a fix for the engine that powers the F-35. The failure of Pratt &amp; Whitney's F135 engine grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer. Flights have resumed but with certain restrictions on speed and other maneuvers. A potential attraction for Canada is that Lockheed's bid offers Canadian industry some $11 billion in work building airplane components. Three other sources familiar with the deliberations said Ottawa had been poised last month to announce it would buy the F-35s. That plan changed when Harper – concerned about the political fallout - suggested that Canada could wait since it did not need to replace its existing CF-18 jets until 2020. One of the three sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Harper could still announce in coming weeks Canada would buy the F-35 and skip a new competition but that "ultimately, it will be a political decision." Boeing's bid would likely include more traditional offset agreements, giving contracts to Canadian firms. Dassault says it is prepared to eventually build the Rafale in Canada. Analysts and opposition critics suspect the government will delay the decision until after the next election. If Canada puts off buying new planes for too long, it would likely have to upgrade its current fleet of aging CF-18s, which date back to 1982, at a cost that some analysts estimate could top $1 billion. Lockheed said on Thursday it was continuing to support the Canadian government and the special secretariat as Ottawa weighed its options. A Boeing spokesman said the company continued to support the Canadian process. Harper is in Wales for a NATO summit, where he is under pressure to boost Canada's defense spending in the face of instability in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Disney"But why is the rum gone??"Rum is often associated with tropical vacations, fruity mixed drinks, and life at sea. But it's not for the faint of heart. Thanks to the experts at FindTheBest, we found the 13 best bottles of rum that even pirates would drool over. Rums were ranked by their Smart Rating scores, which FindTheBest based on the rums' scores in four different rum tasting competitions, as well as reviews from experts at Wine Enthusiast Magazine and the Beverage Tasting Institute. Where ties in Smart Rating scores occurred, we used price as a tiebreaker, ranking lower-priced bottles of rum higher on the list. Plantation uses a blend of its oldest reserves to make its distinctive 20th Anniversary Rum. Drinkers will note a creaminess that comes from years of aging. Montecristo Rum is gold and old — 12 years, to be exact. There's a hotness in the first sip that dissipates into the drink, but it's a characteristic that won this rum a prestigious Double Gold honor in the 2011 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Tommy Bahama may be best known for its tropical apparel, but the Bahamas are known for rum. The Golden Sun Rum conveys the exotic spices and relaxed attitude of the beautiful, Caribbean islands. Aged 15 years, Pusser's Rum hails from the British Virgin Islands and sports subtle flavors of vanilla and honey. With a molasses-like smoothness, rum aficionados appreciate the fact that there's little to no burn from the alcohol. FindTheBestDiplomático Añejo Rum A Cuban formula rum from the Dominican Republic may seem like a juxtaposition, but Vizcaya does it well. Spicy and buttery, the VXOP Cask 21 warms on the way down. Cruzan's Single Barrel Extra-aged Rum is a full-bodied blend so complex that adding a mixer would be considered blasphemy. Its deep color and caramelized aroma evokes the taste and smell of bananas foster. It may be the cheapest rum on the list in price, but certainly not in flavor. Diplomático Añejo Rum is the youngest rum in the brand, aged four years, but its youth lends to its energetic notes of cocoa and coffee. Gosling's Family Reserve Old Rum is considered "the ultimate sipping rum," according to FindTheBest. Aged in dark barrels, this rum's sweetness enables it to be enjoyed like a digestif. Dictador 20 is a dark rum aged in charred barrels for, as the name implies, 20 years. This rum won Double Gold at the 2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. This aged Venezuelan rum is revered for its sweet and smokey taste, and its absence of the harshness that other liquors often have. The $20 price tag is an incredibly reasonable one, given the quality. The Ron Abuelo Centuria is the most expensive bottle on this list, but well worth the price. Thirty years give this rum time to develop a rich and complex taste, with hints of the white oak from the barrels in which it's aged. Also from Ron Abuelo, the 12-Year-Old Rum has a soft mouthfeel and tropical flavors of vanilla and dried fruit. It has a boozy smell, but not to worry — it doesn't carry over upon drinking it. Cachaça is a type of white rum made with fresh sugar cane juice, rather than processed sugar cane, that originates in Brazil. Leblon makes one heck of a cachaça, winning Double Gold year over year at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. The fresh fruitiness of Leblon's cachaça makes it the perfect liquor for your next caipirinha.

REUTERSLightning strikes over buildings during heavy rainfall in Kunshan, Jiangsu province.Stocks finished Thursday lower after an eventful morning that saw the European Central Bank unexpected cut interest rates and signal that it would begin an asset purchase program in October. Markets in Europe rallied after the ECB's announcement, and stocks in the U.S. opened higher, but lost altitude steadily during the day and closed with small losses.  First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Thursday: 1. The biggest story on Thursday was the ECB's decision to cut interest rates. Market expectations were for the ECB to keep rates unchanged, but the central bank decided to take its main overnight rate down to 0.05%, its marginal lending facility to 0.3%, and its deposit facility to -0.2%. These rates are down from 0.15%, 0.4%, and -0.1%, respectively. Following this announcement, the Euro plunged against the dollar, trading below $1.30, its lowest level since last summer.  2. At his press conference accompanying the rate decision, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would begin the purchase of asset-backed securities and Euro-denominated covered bonds in October. Draghi said the scale of these purposes was not known, but Draghi did say the ECB would be willing to expand the size of its balance sheet as part of these operations. The ECB staff also gave its updated inflation and GDP expectations, cutting its GDP outlooks for 2014 and 2015 to 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively, while projecting that inflation will come in at 0.6% and 1.1% in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  3. In Draghi's press conference, he reiterated many of the comments made at Jackson Hole in late August, when Draghi said that fiscal and structural reforms are also needed in addition to the ECB's monetary actions, to spur growth in the Eurozone. BI's Tomas Hirst noted that Draghi's comments Thursday can be read as a challenge to politicians around the Eurozone, namely German chancellor Angela Merkel, to pare their austerity programs with Draghi argues has impaired the Eurozone's economic recovery.  4. In the U.S., we got two pieces of employment data ahead of the U.S. monthly jobs report which is expected to be released Friday morning. Weekly initial jobless claims rose slightly, to 302,000 from 298,00 a week ago. ADP's monthly report on private payrolls showed that private employers added fewer workers than expected, with payrolls climbing by 204,000, down from July's 212,000 gain and lower than the 220,000 increase expected by economists.  5. Also on the U.S. data front, ISM's non-manufacturing PMI report for August came in at 59.6, up from 58.7 in July to mark the highest reading since August 2005.  6. Shares of oil giant BP fell nearly 6% after a court found that the company was grossly negligent in its 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company has already agreed to pay out $13.7 billion in damages, and the ruling on Thursday allows the U.S. to seek a maximum fine of $18 billion.  7. David Tepper, founder of $20 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, said that the bond rally is over, "It's the beginning of the end of the bond market rally," Tepper told Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle. "We are done." Tepper's comments come after Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Funds, one of the few people on Wall Street to predict this year's rally in bonds, told BI in early August that he expects the 10-year yield to remain between 2.2%-2.8% this year.  8. On Friday morning, we get the August jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expectations are for nonfarm payrolls to grow by 230,000 in August and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 6.1%.

With the labor market improving and after nearly six years of ultra-easy Federal Reserve policy, hawkish members of the FOMC have become increasingly vocal about the need to increase interest rates.  However, while these hawks generate a lot of headlines, they are a minority among voting members, occupying just two of 10 spots.  Next year, as the debate over rate hikes becomes more prominent, the annual rotation in voting FOMC members will further weaken the hawks and bolster the doves. This suggests that the risk lies with later rate increases, not earlier. Guggenheim Partners FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersFormer SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager Martoma walks out of the courthouse in downtown Manhattan, New YorkBy Joseph Ax NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday refused to throw out the insider trading conviction of former SAC Capital portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, saying the trial evidence "overwhelmingly demonstrated Martoma's guilt." The decision from U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, who oversaw the trial earlier this year, was in response to a request from Martoma and came ahead of his sentencing on Monday on conspiracy and securities fraud convictions. A jury found Martoma, 40, guilty in February of engaging in what prosecutors claimed was the most lucrative insider trading scheme in history, enabling SAC to make profits and avoid losses of $275 million in trades in Elan Corp and Wyeth. Elan was acquired last year by Perrigo Company Plc , while Wyeth is now a unit of Pfizer Inc . SAC itself pleaded guilty last year to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle criminal and civil charges. Martoma was convicted of trading on confidential tips from two doctors about a clinical trial for an Alzheimer's drug that was eventually deemed ineffective. In addition to refusing to toss Martoma's conviction, Gardephe denied his request for a new trial. The judge rejected his contention that the key government witness – Sidney Gilman, a doctor who testified as part of a cooperation deal that he had given Martoma the clinical results – was unreliable. "To the contrary, Dr. Gilman's account was – as to the key issues – supported by strong circumstantial evidence," Gardephe wrote. Martoma also claimed the jury was tainted by widespread media reports regarding his expulsion from Harvard for doctoring a transcript. But Gardephe said there was no evidence any juror had been exposed to that information. Martoma's defense lawyer, Richard Strassberg, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has recommended a "substantial" prison term beyond the eight years recommended by probation officers, according to court filings. An eight-year term would be among the stiffest insider trading penalties handed down in recent years. Lawyer Matthew Kluger received the longest U.S. insider trading sentence at 12 years after pleading guilty in 2011 to participating in a $37 million scheme. Martoma is one of eight SAC employees to be convicted of insider trading. SAC's founder, Steven A. Cohen, has not been criminally charged. The firm has changed its name to Point72 Asset Management and no longer manages outside money, instead focusing on Cohen's family fortune. The case is U.S. v.

Architects around the globe are racing to build the world's first 3D printed houses — a breakthrough with profound implications for housing affordability and customization. In China, a company named Winsun this year said it built 10 3D printed houses in just one day. The reported cost for each: just $5,000. In Amsterdam, a team of architects has started construction of the 3D Print Canal House, using bio-based, renewable materials. The site is both construction site and public museum; President Obama was among the visitors this year. Hedwig Heinsman, co-founder of DUS architects, the team behind the project, tells Business Insider that in addition to being ec0-friendly, "The main goal, I think, is really to deliver custom-made architecture." 3D printers build structures layer by layer. But at USC in California, Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis is pushing the fabrication process one step further with what he calls "contour crafting." He hopes to develop a gigantic 3D printer, able to print whole house in a single run, from its structure to its electrical and plumbing conduits. The revolution in 3D printed housing, in other words, is well underway. Produced by France Costrel. Edited by Sam Rega.

Via FlickrThis week's Bloomberg Businessweek cover story profiles Steven Ma, a 36-year-old former hedge fund analyst who is making millions guaranteeing families that he can get their children into a top college — or their money back. Ma is the founder of ThinkTank Learning, described by Bloomberg reporter Peter Waldman as "a chain of San Francisco Bay Area tutoring centers that operate out of strip malls." As long as an applicant can reach a certain GPA and SAT score — and the family pays tens of thousands of dollars — Ma guarantees his almost entirely Asian immigrant clientele admission to one of the best colleges in the country. According to Waldman, "Some 10,000 students—sixth graders to junior-college grads—use ThinkTank’s services now, generating annual revenue of more than $18 million." Here's how Ma makes his promises: Ma, a former hedge fund analyst, makes bets on student admissions the way a trader plays the commodities markets. Using 12 variables from a student's profile—from grades and test scores to extracurricular activities and immigration status—Ma's software crunches the odds of admission to a range of top-shelf colleges. His proprietary algorithm assigns varying weights to different parameters, derived from his analysis of the successes and failures of thousands of students he's coached over the years. Ma's algorithm, for example, predicts that a U.S.-born high school senior with a 3.8 GPA, an SAT score of 2,000 (out of 2,400), moderate leadership credentials, and 800 hours of extracurricular activities, has a 20.4 percent chance of admission to New York University and a 28.1 percent shot at the University of Southern California. Those odds determine the fee ThinkTank charges that student for its guaranteed consulting package: $25,931 to apply to NYU and $18,826 for USC. "Of course we set limits on who we'll guarantee," says Ma. "We don't want to make this a casino game." Via Wikimedia CommonsSteven Ma is the founder and CEO of ThinkTank Learning.Ma also offers "custom contracts" that can net ThinkTank over a million dollars. In one such case, Waldman writes, Ma would receive $1.1 million dollars if he could get a 16-year-old student with an "academic transcript [that] looked like a rap sheet" into U.S. News &amp; World Report's top ranked school — Harvard and Princeton were both tied for number one at the time. According to Waldman, "Ma would get nothing, however, if the boy achieved a 3.0 GPA and a 1600 SAT score and still wasn't accepted at a top-100 college. For admission to a school ranked 81 to 100, Ma would get to keep $300,000; schools ranked 51 to 80 would let Ma hang on to $400,000; and for a top-50 admission, Ma's payoff started at $600,000, climbing $10,000 for every rung up the ladder to No.<U+2009>1." More than just focusing on grades and scores, Waldman writes that Ma "tiger-moms the whole kid." Ma and about 30 ThinkTank "college-admission consultants" help students find community college classes, internships, and volunteer positions to help beef up their applications. The ThinkTank team will also "brainstorm and edit essays to 'strategically position' students' voices and résumés," Waldman notes. This brand of quantified college admissions is unsurprisingly derided by the people making the decisions themselves — college admissions officers. Richard Shaw, Stanford University dean of admissions and financial aid, called Ma's algorithm "ludicrous," telling Waldman, "Helping young people game the system is the wrong approach." However, Ma says he has the data to back up his guarantees. Using University of California, Berkeley — one of the most popular schools among his San Francisco-area clientele — as an example, he tells Waldman that the numbers prove that his methods work. This year, Berkeley took 17.3% of applicants, with a 4.18 overall high school GPA. According to Ma, he gets more students in with lower grades — 22% of ThinkTank clients applying to Berkeley were accepted, he says, with an average GPA of 4.15.

REUTERS/Stephen LamThe iPhone fingerprint scanner could be just the start.Apple looks bad after the theft of thousands of nude photos of celebrities allegedly taken from its iCloud servers, even if the company denies responsibility. The fiasco is one reason that company shares fell 4.2% on Wednesday, and some have warned it could spoil the expected Sept. 9 announcement of the iPhone 6 and a smartwatch. But Apple is not alone in cybersecurity vulnerability. Home Depot, Target, UPS, and thousands of other businesses have suffered major data breaches, while more than a billion passwords were recently stolen from around the web by Russian hackers, with untold more taken through the Heartbleed bug More than any one company, it's cybersecurity in general that is broken. Passwords have become unreliable, especially since few people have the wherewithal to create, remember, and update dozens of long and unique passwords — and solutions offered by password managers are unwieldy, as I've learned while using LastPass for the past few weeks. In the face of this crisis, Apple may be closer than anyone to a viable solution. It starts with the fingerprint sensor in the iPhone. Introduced in the iPhone 5S, this technology works much better than versions in other phones and while not infallible it is very secure, with fingerprint data stored in highly encrypted form on the device and nowhere else. So far this technology has been available for logging into iPhones and making purchases from Apple, but it was opened up to third-party developers earlier this summer. Letting other apps use it could make all mobile payments much more secure — so much so that analysts are warning PayPal and other mobile-payment competitors are in trouble. What's more, adding fingerprint technology to password managers, as promised by 1Password and hinted by LastPass, could finally make those programs work smoothly. And current fingerprint technology is just the beginning. A recent Apple patent for a way to change security requirements based on location mentions the possibility of "DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans, voice identification, cadence of typing, walking, talking, and other biometric identification methods." In other words, highly secure multifactor authentication systems are likely in the works. All told, these innovations could boost Apple's mobile security by leaps and bounds. As for nude selfies, however, we're still waiting for assurance from Apple that iCloud is safe or getting safer. It would be a game changer if Apple integrated fingerprint technology or other forms of multifactor authentication into web services. While that mere possibility is exciting, in the meantime you may be better of deleting those pictures. Disclosure: I am invested in Apple. FREE AppDownload
Screenshot via Bloomberg.comDavid Tepper calls the end of the bond market rally.David Tepper says the bond rally is over.  Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle, Tepper said, "It's the beginning of the end of the bond market rally. We are done."  Tepper, the founder of $20 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, made these comments following the ECB's interest rate cuts — and asset purchase program — announced earlier this morning. After starting 2014 at around 3%, the yield on the ten-year fell to less than 2.4% during the summer and is currently trading near 2.45%. Bonds in the Eurozone have also been rallying this summer, with the yield on 10-year German bunds falling below 1%. It's not clear if Tepper's call is for the end of this year's bond rally, or for a meaningful break from the nearly thirty-year bull market that investors have enjoyed since the U.S. 10-year topped out above 15% in the early 1980s. Tepper's comments also come after Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Funds, one of the few people on Wall Street who predicted this year's rally in bonds, told BI in early August that he expects the 10-year yield to remain between 2.2%-2.8%, with the risk that yields fall below 2.2%.  Here's the amazing run enjoyed in the U.S. 10-year over the last forty years.

REUTERS/Fred Dufour/PoolRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, with France's President Francois Hollande as he arrives at the Elysee Palace in Paris on June 5. French President Francois Hollande that a ceasefire and a political settlement in Ukraine were conditions for the delivery of a French warship built for Russia. "What are the conditions? A ceasefire and a political settlement," he told reporters, noting that the $1.6 billion deal was neither canceled nor suspended. "Today these conditions are not in place." Stopping the sale of two Mistral-class warships to Russia would cost France as much as $1.3 billion, a French diplomat told BBC. On Wednesday, Hollande reportedly decided to suspend delivery of the warships in a signal of Western cohesion amid Russia's continued escalation in Ukraine. Russia has reportedly paid much of the $1.6 billion contract, so Paris would have to reimburse that money as well as pay an extra $328 million penalty payment. Moscow still expects the warships to be delivered, noting that Paris would have problems finding a new buyer because the vessels were built to meet Russia's requirements with Russian equipment. "If the contract is suspended, the French side's headache will be worse than ours," Oleg Bochkaryov, deputy chairman of the government's Military-Industrial Commission, which helps oversee the defense industry, told Interfax. The first ship — called the Vladivostok — had been scheduled for delivery in October, and Russian soldiers were sent to France in June to begin training on the first Mistral.  Stephane Mahe/ReutersThe Mistral-class helicopter carrier Vladivostok is seen at the STX Les Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard site in Saint-Nazaire on Thursday.The Mistral helicopter carrier warships would plug a hole in Russia's military capabilities. Russia's Black Sea fleet is not believed to have the capacity to launch a land invasion, a problem an amphibious ship like the Mistral would solve.  France held out under U.S. pressure for a long time. Hollande was even prepared to push the deal through after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine. But on the eve of a NATO summit — where Ukraine will be a key topic — Paris decided to hold off for the time being. "Russian actions in eastern Ukraine have breached the foundations of security in Europe," read the statement from Hollande's office, which added that conditions were "not met" for the delivery to continue as planned.  FREE AppDownload
"Strengthening America's economic security by cementing its economic alliances is not simply an option, but an imperative," writes Miriam Sapiro in a new policy paper on the economic and strategic rationales of "an ambitious domestic and global trade agenda" for the United States. In "Why Trade Matters," Sapiro, a visiting fellow in Global Economy and Development at Brookings and former deputy U.S. Trade Representative from 2009 to 2014, argues that "[w]ith 95 percent of the world's population living outside of the United States, America cannot recover its economic footing as quickly or as effectively without the ability to deliver on an expansive trade agenda." These maps from Sapiro's report demonstrate important aspects of America's trade position in the world. Italics are quotes from her report. "Just as a more open trade policy helped the United States regain its economic footing after the Great Depression, U.S. trade policy today is designed to help America recover from the most serious recession of modern times," she writes.  via Brookings Institution During the past five years, increased exports have been responsible for one-third of U.S. economic growth. Last year U.S. exports of goods and services reached a record high of $2.3 trillion. America's exports to its 20 free trade agreement (FTA) partners have risen by 57 percent in the past five years, compared to just 44 percent for the rest of the world. Excluding oil, the United States has a trade surplus in goods of more than $15 billion, which has increased 70 percent since 2009,9 in addition to a trade surplus in services of $225 billion. These exports support over 11 million jobs, 1.5 million of which have been created since 2010. U.S. workers are playing a key role in expanding global value chains, which take advantage of advances in U.S. technology and energy independence. Sapiro calls the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) "the cornerstone of the Obama administration's economy policy in the Asia-Pacfic region."  via Brookings Institution The TPP partners together account for nearly 40 percent of global GDP and one-third of global trade, and span an area of nearly 800 million people. Taken as a whole, TPP countries are America's largest goods and services export market, valued at $698 billion. With the addition of Canada, Mexico and Japan last year, the group now includes three out of four of America's largest trading partners, in addition to some of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Today there are 525 million middle-class consumers in Asia, but that number is expected to jump to 2.7 billion by 2030.  "If the United States and the European Union can reach an agreement [on the Transatlantic Trade &amp; Investment Partnership], it will result in greater integration and cooperation within the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship," Sapiro writes.  via Brookings Institution Both economies are responsible for nearly half of global GDP and about one-third of all international trade, and have a combined market of over 800 million people. But notwithstanding the $2.7 billion in goods and services that flow each day and the $4 trillion invested in each other’s economies that support more than 13 million jobs in the United States and the EU, both sides believe their economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that eliminating tariffs and reducing non-tariff barriers to goods and services exports could generate billions of dollars in new exports and thousands of new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. "A successful outcome to [TPP and TTIP] negotiations would benefit not only the countries participating directly in them, but also their trading partners," argues Sapiro. via Brookings Institution Taken together, the countries participating in TPP and TTIP account for two-thirds of global GDP and half of global trade, and have a combined market of 1.3 billion consumers. Nearly 70 percent of U.S. exports already go to TPP or TTIP partners, and 84 percent of foreign direct investment comes from them. By 2018, TPP and TTIP markets are estimated to grow by $6.7 trillion. At the conclusion of both negotiations, the United States would enjoy liberalized trade with almost two-thirds of the global economy. A strong nation needs a strong economy that can generate growth, spur innovation and create jobs. This is true, of course, not only for the United States but also for its key partners and the rest of the global trading system. Much as the United States led the way in forging strong military alliances after World War II to discourage a resurgence of militant nationalism in Europe or Asia, now is the time to place equal emphasis on shoring up our collective economic security. A failure to act now could undermine international security and place stability in key regions in further jeopardy. Download and read the entire policy paper. FREE AppDownload
USCGBP shares were down nearly 6% Thursday after a court found the firm grossly negligent in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico disaster, Bloomberg reports. Fines are likely for the firm as a result of the decision. Earlier this year, an appeals court upheld a lower-court decision allowing the U.S. government to seek a maximum fine of $18 billion if Thursday's ruling of gross negligence came down.  The London-based firm has already agreed to pay out $13.7 billion, including a $9.2 billion settlement with spill claims victims. The company announced in July it was taking a $43 billion charge to cover any further penalties.  Eleven people were killed and 16 injured in the explosion. “BP’s conduct was reckless,” federal district judge Carl Barbier wrote in the decision in New Orleans federal court, Bloomberg said.  The precise penalties will be set following hearing scheduled for next January, the Financial Times' Ed Crooks says. BP has always denied gross negligence and is expected to appeal, he adds. Transocean and Halliburton were also found culpable but face lower fines. Their shares both climbed on the ruling. Click here to read the full story on Bloomberg.com » FREE AppDownload
© RIA-NOVOSTI/AFP Alexei NikolskyRussia's President Vladimir Putin (2nd right) visits a refinery of Russian oil giant Rosneft  in the Black Sea port of Tuapse in southern Russia, on October 11, 2013Moscow (AFP) - Russian state oil giant Rosneft, which has been hit by Western sanctions, will cut up to a quarter of the staff from its administrative headquarters in Moscow, the business daily Kommersant reported. "The company could cut 20 to 25 percent of the staff -- some 1,000 employees," the newspaper said, citing sources close to the company. Kommersant said that a number of employees at the Moscow headquarters had jumped in recent years, especially with the $55 billion (42-billion-euro) acquisition last year of rival TNK-BP. A company spokeswoman, speaking to AFP, denied plans for "massive job cuts" but acknowledged that "Rosneft is working to reduce its expenses, including by optimising its staff levels."  Washington has targeted state-controlled Rosneft, preventing it from raising anything but short-term funding in US markets, for its paramount role in Russia's oil industry and because its chief Igor Sechin is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. The US sanctions appear to be hurting the company's finances, with Rosneft appealing to the government for help to refinance part of $45 billion of debt it took on as a part of its drive to become Russia's top oil company.   FREE AppDownload

The companies are hammering out final terms of a deal and could announce their agreement as soon as next week, the people said on Thursday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Discussions are ongoing and could still take longer to finalize, the people cautioned. Representatives for GE and Electrolux declined to comment. GE's century-old household appliance business, which along with lighting generated $8.3 billion in 2013 revenue, could help the Swedish appliance manufacturer expand beyond its core European market where growth has trailed that of North America.

LOC Manufacturing in the U.S. will never be what it was. Employment in the sector is down nearly 50% from its May 1979 peak, and fell more than 10% during the Great Recession. But 3D printing, which last fall Credit Suisse forecast could grow up to 30%, has the potential to reshape how America makes stuff, creating new high tech jobs in the U.S. and bringing old ones back from abroad.    “I see manufacturing taking a profound turn with additive technologies in the next five years," S. Kent Rockwell, CEO of 3D printing firm ExOne, said in a recent PriceWaterhouseCoopers report. "We’ll see elite job shops grow, and new start-ups grow. We’ll also see blue-collar employees learn the technology and adapt and start wearing white shirts." 3D printing, which is also known as additive manufacturing, is the process of creating products and parts on site.  The labor input savings 3D printing can yield for employers are substantial — and at the same time, the technology appears poised to create markets for new, higher-skilled jobs. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, gave PwC the example of a small tool-and-die casting company whose costs start falling as their upfront investment in a 3D printing pays off, allowing them to take on larger-scale jobs that require more complexity. "As we see the possibilities of new materials expand and the cost of industrial printers go down, and the print speeds rise, you’ll see adoption not only by larger companies, but also by the smaller companies," he said. Paul said that viability could become an issue for those who aren't willing to make the leap. 3D printing is already reshaping job requirements at industrial conglomerates. GE Aviation, for example, is developing 3D printed (or additively manufactured) fuel nozzles to be used in its LEAP engine for commercial planes.  "I actually see additive as producing situations where you’re going to have higher-skilled positions that companies are going to need to fill, both on the technician level, and the engineering and design level," Greg Morris, who leads the GE team, told Business Insider. "And I frankly think you’ll see a different type of machining that will challenge the current state of machining, meaning you’ll get complex parts that a machinist will have to work with versus starting with a block of material. So you’re not replacing machinists, you’re just asking them to learn a little different skill set of what they start with and work with." Graham Flanagan for Business InsiderGE is now using 3D printing technology to create prototype parts, like this turbine.Graham Flanagan for Business InsiderHere's the finished product. The growth of 3D manufacturing may end up reverberating through global labor markets. Brian Krassenstein, founder of 3D Printing news site 3DPrint.com, says that as manufacturing costs rise in China and fall in the U.S., jobs at megafactories like Foxconn could begin to disappear.  "In fact, we have already seen this beginning to happen with Apple and Google," he writes. "Sure, many of these jobs will be suited best for machines, but someone has to maintain these machines, manage the supply chains, and oversee production." Large firms' search for more efficient labor that first gave rise to offshoring. If they can once again find it at home, they will act decisively. "3-D printing ... appears poised to bring about a global trade rebalancing, as the new economics of manufacturing rewards high-skill workforces like that of the U.S. and make supplies of cheap labor in countries like China less relevant," National Journal's Ben Schreckinger wrote recently.  "Upstream" manufacturing, the point at which goods are produced, is likely to feel the most effects from the growth of 3D printing. But the jobs impact could also flow downstream to retail. Angel investor Esther Dyson has written that furniture sellers and other household goods peddlers could start disappearing, replaced by individuals who manufacture and sell furniture at the same location.     TechProResearch60% of 624 firms surveyed say they're thinking about using 3D printing. "Over time, these print shops will replace thousands of stores carrying millions of items, some of which sit around for months waiting to be bought," she says. "They will print goods using designs from online services that offer designs for both open-source, free-design goods and branded goods that may not seem very distinct except for a logo." The impact 3D printing could have on manufacturing has already been acknowledged by President Obama, who launched the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama talked up the institute, which is run out of a manufacturing facility in Youngstown, Ohio.  "A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything," Obama said.  Not everyone agrees the technology's impact on labor will be so enormous. Right now, 95% of 3D printing is used to make small industrial parts like GE's nozzle. Writing on Gizmodo, Nick Allen, the founder of 3D printing company 3D Print UK, believes limitations on output quality will prevent 3D printers becoming a mass-market item. Thus, there will still be a need for people to hawk non-3D printed food and personal supplies. "3D printing will continue to grow in areas like the prototyping market, low-volume production runs (on very high-end machines), medical, aerospace — the list goes on," he writes. "But as an everyday household object? I’m not convinced."  Despite their growth, the biggest 3D printing firms, like 3D Systems and Stratsys, only employ a few thousand people. PwC found that 45.3% of manufacturers attributed their “lack of current expertise in our company to fully exploit the technology” as a barrier to implementing 3D printing into their business. But these are only the firms that are directly in the industry. Retail, product development, and manufacturing firms all potentially stand in 3D printing's firing line— and as International Labour Organization's David Seligson points out, 3D printing is likely to blur the line between jobs in these industries.  "Take, for example, the car company that wants to move from printing prototypes of components to printing those components at scale," he said. "That would effectively mean that its model-makers would be doing the work of assembly-line workers, which could lead to contractual disputes and complaints over deskilling, intellectual property and so on." It may simply be too early to say what the technology's lasting impact will be. Even 3DPrint.com's Krassenstein acknowledges as much.  "You could ask a hundred economists what they think will eventually happen once the 3D printing and robotics markets mature, and you will likely get a hundred different answers," he writes. "We have seen what technology has done in the past, destroying millions of jobs, but in the process creating tens of millions of new jobs. There is little reason to believe that this wave of progress will be any different." FREE AppDownload
AirbusA380s roll off the final assembly-line in Toulouse, France.Europe's Airbus said on Thursday that new orders topped 1,000 aircraft in the first eight months of the year as airlines order fuel-saving models, but cancellations continued to weigh on net orders, which remain behind those of rival Boeing. The planemaking subsidiary of Airbus sold 21 aircraft in August, a traditionally quiet month following the busy Farnborough Airshow in July, bringing its total gross orders for the year to 1,001 aircraft, monthly data showed. Adjusting for cancellations, Airbus reported 722 net orders between January and August. In the latest figures available for Boeing, the U.S. planemaker posted 981 gross orders between Jan. 1 and Aug. 26, or 918 orders after accounting for 63 cancellations. AirbusAirbus says the A320neo is 15% more fuel efficient than the A320. Airbus says the total of 279 cancellations it has announced this year are boosted by conversions from one product to another, as airlines hop out of the current-generation A320 single-aisle family into the newer and more efficient A320neo. It has argued Boeing will face similar pressure to convert orders when its own revamped 737 MAX approaches delivery, but some analysts have expressed concerns about the underlying level of cancellations as investors remain sensitive to any signs of weakness in recently strong demand for passenger jets. The A320neo is being readied for its first test flight with engines from Pratt &amp; Whitney, expected in the second half of the month. August's order figures included four more upgrades from the existing A320 to the A320neo from major single-aisle customer AirAsia, bringing the total number of A320 order conversions this year to 73. Cancellations also reflect the loss of an order for 70 A350 wide-body aircraft from Emirates airline in June, though Airbus is ahead of its net order guidance for the year. International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) meanwhile ordered eight A350-900 aircraft, exercising an option for its Spanish subsidiary Iberia in August. Airbus has now reached 750 orders for its next generation of long-distance aircraft, designed to compete with Boeing's lightweight, carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner. BoeingBoeing says it's 737MAX is 8% more fuel efficient than the 737.Separately, the head of the European Aviation Safety Agency told Reuters the A350 was on schedule to receive its safety certification by the end of September. It is due to enter service with Qatar Airways by the end of the year. In its latest update, Airbus also said it had delivered 389 aircraft between January and August. Boeing delivered 400 between January and July and was expected to issue August deliveries with an order update later on Thursday. Airbus is targeting around the same number of deliveries in 2014 as last year, when it delivered 626 passenger jets. It says net orders should exceed this. Boeing is targeting 715-725 deliveries in 2014. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Blaise Robinson and James Regan) FREE AppDownload

Rumor has it Park Hyatt New York could become the first new five-star hotel in New York in more than 11 years. The rating is determined by the venerable Forbes Travel Guide, which will send an inspector (and a second anonymous inspector) to review the hotel in the next six months. New York currently has eight 5-star hotels, the 11-year-old Mandarin Oriental being the most recently anointed. Should Park Hyatt qualify for the Forbes Travel Guide's top rating, it has to go above and beyond, providing "room amenities including fresh flowers and wine by the glass presented in the bottle and poured by room-service staff."

Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing survey climbed to 59.6 from 58.7 in August and besting expectations for 57.7. It's the highest reading since August 2005. The employment component hit its highest level since February 2006, which bodes well for Friday's non-farm payroll report. Every single component of the survey is now growing: ISM   And here's their sampling of anecdotes describing the state of the services industry: ISM Meanwhile, Markit Economics' survey hit 59.5, in August, better than an earlier reading of 58.5 but below July's 60.8 reading.  The composite reading of 59.7 was the lowest in three months.

FedExPaul Brandon has driven 34 years without an accident.Connecticut truck driver Paul Brandon has never hauled to Tucson, Tucumcari, or Tonopah. But over the course of his 34-year career in the industry, he has, as the song goes, driven nearly every kind of rig that's ever been made. And over 1.1 million miles, according to Brandon's employer Fedex Brandon, has never had an accident. This is one of the reasons the 55-year-old father of two just earned the title as one of the country's greatest truck drivers at the annual National Truck Driving Championships, sponsored by the American Trucking Association. Brandon won in the contest's 48-foot flatbed division, but one could argue he's actually No.1 in the country. Other drivers, including this year's ATA Grand Champion, have racked up more professional miles over their career without an accident. But to qualify, Brandon, who drives for FedEx, also had to maintain a clean record in his personal driving. That includes accidents in which he wasn't at fault. Brandon's 34 years as a driver best the grand champion's 28. How is a record like that even possible when, as Brandon recently asserted to Business Insider, truck drivers make more decisions in a minute than airline pilots? There's no trick, he said. "I keep my eyes on the road and my hands on the wheel and I pay attention," he said. "It's a constant vigilance at all times — there’s no taking your eyes off the road, no taking your hands of the wheel, every minute you're sitting there driving down the road, whenever you're stopped, don't be fiddling with the radio at a traffic light." "People have hobbies — my passion is truck-driving championships," he told Business Insider recently. "Saturdays and Sundays I go down to the yard [to train]. It can be a long summer, when my wife asks me to fix the kitchen sink and I'm still washing the truck trailer or painting the wheels. But I manage to find time." The competition sounds like something that could easily get picked up by ESPN 2. The skills course tests various forms of precision driving including braking, parking, and backing, all up against the clock.   There is also a written test that covers everything from safety to hazardous materials to first aid, and a pretrip course where drivers must root out defects planted by course administrators. Brandon says he started practicing in March, and his kids often found him asleep slumped over a book. Brandon's career took a relatively conventional course, at least as far as his generation goes. He grew up liking big machines, and thought about becoming a civil engineer. After some schooling, he worked for as a garbage hauler before meeting someone in the trucking industry who agreed to take him under his wing. That was the extent of his formal training. "I've done everything from drive dumpsters to flatbeds to liquid tankers, hauled frozen foods, just about everything at one time or another," he said. He's been on flatbeds for the past 14 years, running local pick-up and delivery routes in and around Connecticut. He says they're unique among rigs for the amount of manual labor they require outside of driving. "You have to chain stuff down, secure it, tarp it, watch it," he said. These requirements have improved safety records but have complicated the nation's mounting truck-driver shortage. We've previously discussed some of the perverse economic incentives that have led to the problem. Brandon insists the problem is cyclical and that trucking firms have already begun making increasing incentives to attract more drivers. "Companies are coming a long way with trying to give time off from work for drivers to be with their families and keep them rested, the pay packages are coming up to attract a lot of good people to industry," he said. "The question is can we keep pace with the growth?" He said he's not concerned about drivers being able to match his safety record, thanks to the proliferation of driver-aiding technology. "When I first started driving, if you had a spot mirror on the right side of a truck ... now they have lane departure systems, stability-control systems, forward Vorad [Vehicle Onboard Radar] systems, cruise control, the technology they have is quite amazing. And I think they'll be able to keep making it safer and drivers of today will be able to carry it on." &gt;The prize for first place in Pittsburgh is $1,000, a sum that pales against the thrill of putting on the gold belt buckle first-place finishers also receive. "There are only nine people in the country this year that are going to get a gold belt buckle," he said. "When you win a national title and get that gold belt buckle, you become one of the best of the best." Brandon says that after conquering flatbeds he's moving on to tankers. While retirement has crept into his psyche it is not an imminent threat — especially since he is still not technically a grand champion. "Once you get to a certain level, you want to get to the next level, then you want to get to another," he said. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski ECB President Mario Draghi  The European Central Bank's (ECB) simultaneous announcement of an asset purchase program and cuts to its main interest rates should provide a strong message to European leaders: We have done all we can, now it's your turn. The divergence of national economies within Europe, with the core (France, Germany, Netherlands) pulling away from the struggling periphery (Greece, Spain and Portugal), has meant that it has proven difficult for lower rates to translate into the higher bank lending needed to boost troubled economies. This has helped to exacerbate the underlying tensions within the monetary union and has begun to impact the health of the region's larger economies. ECB President Mario Draghi explicitly stated that the asset purchase program, under which the ECB will purchase European asset-backed securities (loans pledged against a collection of assets) from the market, is being undertaken to get around these transmission problems.  Used in concert with the already announced Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operation, whereby Eurozone banks can gain access to cheap funding from the central bank in return for higher lending, the idea is to get funding to small and medium-sized businesses that have languished as the Euro crisis has worn on. In essence, however, this will mean that the ECB is promising funding to banks to create asset-backed loans that they will then purchase. If that sounds circular, it should.  And it has caused financial writer Frances Coppola to worry that the ECB is exposing itself to a big moral hazard problem: [As] far as I can see, the SME ABS programme is either going to be too small to make much difference, or is likely to encounter serious problems with loan quality at some point, putting the ECB's balance sheet at risk. (I highly recommend reading the full post) As Coppola points out, while this scheme may be sufficient to help some healthy firms that have struggled to raise financing in recent years it relies heavily on a sharp increase in the supply of these types of loans. That, in turn, poses its own problems. The quality of the loans are linked directly to the health of the underlying assets that they are pledged against. Within Europe, firms with the greatest potential to benefit from this scheme will be concentrated in already healthy economies in the core. So just as with interest rate cuts, the countries likely to benefit most are the same ones that are least in need of it. Although Draghi pledged his commitment to "structural reform" within the Eurozone, he also repeated his call for a discussion on the overall stance of fiscal policy — suggesting he wants governments to ease up on their austerity programs and start spending again. In his press conference following the rate cut announcement, Draghi dismissed talk of a "grand bargain" between fiscal and monetary powers in the monetary union. However, he did add "we all just have to do our own jobs." The implication is that Draghi has done his job and — short of entering the topsy-turvy world of aggressively negative interest rates — has no more weapons at his disposal. He needs governments to step in, too. If I were Angela Merkel, I would read that as a challenge. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/David Manning A large sinkhole damaged this structure in Florida. I don't spend much time worrying that tornadoes, earthquakes or other acts of God will destroy my northern Virginia home. But, sinkholes freak me out. In May, a block-long sinkhole swallowed parts of a Baltimore neighborhood less than an hour's drive from mine. And a 12-foot-deep hole collapsed two backyards and threatened homes in Stafford, Virginia, about 50 miles south of mine. Sinkholes routinely swallow parts of Florida, the sinkhole capital of the U.S. And a 37-acre sinkhole in Assumption Parrish, Louisiana, opened two years ago and continues to devour land as I write. So, I'm not insane for worrying that a sinkhole has my name on it, even though I don't live in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania — places that see the most damage from sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A sinkhole is a depression where rainwater pools and seeps through the soil, dissolving rock and creating spaces and caverns underground. The land can stay intact forever. Or, one day the spaces grow too big, and the earth gives way. Most sinkholes don't open up over night; it's mostly a gradual process. Here are warning signs that your home is sinking. · Stair step-shaped cracks appear in your home's exterior and/or foundation.· Cracks widen in interior walls, ceilings, floors and around door and window frames.· Doors and windows are difficult to close without scraping frames or the floor.· Trees and fence posts slump for no obvious reason.· Circles of plants wilt because that can't get enough water, which drains into holes beneath the surface.· Rainwater pools in areas that once drained well.· A sunken area around your foundation, or an actual cavity, appears.· Water bills suddenly climb because a sinkhole is damaging your plumbing. I'd run screaming down the street. But you should follow these tips. 1. If a sinkhole threatens your house, get out immediately, and call your local emergency management organization, then your insurance company. 2. If you suspect a sinkhole is beginning, call your insurance company, which will send an adjuster to determine if the hole or depression needs further investigation. If it does, your adjuster will send a professional engineering company to your property to begin testing. 3. If a small hole opens, rope off the area to keep curiosity seekers away, and then call your insurance company and your local emergency management organization. If it's only 1 to 3 feet in diameter and depth, you may be able to fill it in with concrete and sand.

Sebastiaan ter Burg/FlickrWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs were far more weaker than previously thought in the second quarter, a government report showed on Thursday, which could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance for a while. The Labor Department said unit labor costs, the price of labor for any given unit of production, fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate instead of the 0.6 percent increase reported last month. Unit labor costs had increased at a rate of 11.6 percent in the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, they rose 1.7 percent. The Fed is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it ponders when to raise benchmark interest rates, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. Investors do not expect a rate increase until around the middle of next year. The Labor Department also revised its initial estimate for productivity, to show it increasing at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter rather than the 2.5 percent pace reported last month.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao) FREE AppDownload
FinVizThe Euro has fallen below $1.30 against the U.S. dollar.A series of surprising and aggressive moves from the European Central Bank today is sending shockwaves through the global financial markets. The ECB announced three rate cuts, including lowering the main refinancing rate to 0.05% from 0.15%, lowering the marginal lending facility rate to 0.3% from 0.4%, and lowering the deposit facility rate to -0.2% from -0.1%.  ECB President Mario Draghi also announced that the ECB would begin buying bonds, specifically covered bonds and asset-backed securities. The euro dropped from $1.3160 to a low of $1.2996, its lowest level since July 2013, and was trading just below $1.30 on Thursday morning after the conclusion of ECB president Mario Draghi's press conference. Stocks in Europe were rally on the news, with markets in France and Spain gaining more than 1.8%, while stocks in Italy closed with gains of more than 2.5%. In Germany, the DAX closed up 0.9%. European bonds were also rallying, with the yield on two-year bonds in Germany and France, among other Euro nations, all falling into negative territory. The yield on 10-year German Bunds, which has been falling sharply through the summer, was also at around 0.95%.  The rate cuts were a surprise to the market, as many believed the ECB was already at the "lower bound" for interest rates. In his press conference on Thursday, however, Draghi made clear that now this is the bottom for rates: "We are at the lower bound." All of these actions are intended to stimulate growth and boost inflation by keeping credit markets liquid and interest rates very low. Draghi announced that the ECB will begin buying asset-backed securities and covered bonds, though Draghi did not specify what the scope of this program would be. Considering that this program involves the outright purchase of asset-backed securities, it is considered quantitative easing, though Draghi seemed reluctant to attach this moniker to the actions announced Thursday in his press conference.  Draghi said the actions announced Thursday are aimed at "credit easing," and said that a broader asset purchase program was discussed at the ECB meeting, with some members wanting to do more, and others less.  In his press conference, Draghi did, however, make clear that the ECB is willing to expand its balance sheet, specifically saying it is comfortable with the balance sheet returning to 2012 levels.  In a note to clients, Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: "It is slightly surprising that this program will also include covered bonds, but it is in line with the likely objective of the ECB to present a program with a size that will meaningfully increase the ECB’s balance sheet, in the absence of sovereign bond purchases. A critical comment was also that the ECB intends 'significantly to stir' the size of its balance sheet, a clear signal that the ECB is now willing actively to expand its balance sheet." GDP growth in the eurozone fell to 0.0% in Q2. And the July and August economic data have suggested a failure to rebound in Q3. Deutsche BankLast Friday, we learned consumer prices in the 18-country eurozone climbed by just 0.3% in August, a slight tick down from 0.4% in July. Prices in Italy actually fell 0.2% year-over-year. This unending series of bad economic news in recent weeks had been putting increasing amounts of pressure on Draghi to act. On Thursday, Draghi also announced the ECB's staff projections for Eurozone inflation and GDP.  The outlook isn't great. In 2014, the ECB sees real GDP growing 0.9%, down from a prior outlook for 1% growth. In 2015, the ECB sees real GDP of 1.6% against a prior outlook of 1.7%. For 2016, however, the ECB raised its GDP projections to 1.8% from 1.7%.  The ECB also said it expects inflation to remain low, saying it sees inflation at 0.6% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015, and 1.4% in 2016.  Draghi said inflation expectations are still anchored, but that the ECB has begun to see an increase in downside risks for Eurozone inflation. Draghi also addressed the limitations of the ECB on Thursday, reiterating a sentiment similar to what he said at Jackson Hole last month. For economic growth in the Eurozone, monetary, fiscal, and structural reform is needed, but given that the ECB only has control over monetary policy, Draghi said that those responsible for each of these areas — namely central bankers and politicians — "simply need to do their jobs." "There is no grand bargain," Draghi said in response to a question about coordination between the ECB and Eurozone governments. In his speech at Jackson Hole, Draghi said, "Sovereign pressure also interrupted the homogeneous transmission of monetary policy across the euro area." And on Thursday, as Draghi emphasized the need for action on structural reforms from individual countries, he said countries shouldn't lose sovereignty, but share it. FREE AppDownload
Feng Li/Getty ImagesA worker drives a forklift past rows of Chinese shipping containers. WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in July to its lowest point in six months as exports rose to a record high, supporting views of sturdy economic growth in the third quarter. The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap fell 0.6 percent to $40.5 billion, the lowest since January. June's trade deficit was revised to $40.8 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the deficit to widen to $42.2 billion in July from a previously reported $41.5 billion shortfall in June. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit narrowed to $48.2 billion, the lowest since December 2013, from $48.9 billion in June, which could see economists raise their estimates for third quarter gross domestic product. Trade weighed on growth in the April-June period. Exports increased 0.9 percent to a record high of $198.0 billion in July, supported by a surge in goods, automobiles, parts and engines, as well as non-petroleum products. Imports rebounded 0.7 percent in July to $238.6 billion after declining in June. The rebound in imports is a sign of underlying strength in domestic demand. The increase in imports was driven by food and autos, which both hit record highs. Petroleum imports declined, which saw the petroleum deficit hitting its lowest level since May 2009. A domestic energy boom has seen the United States reduce its dependence on foreign oil. The politically sensitive trade gap with China was the highest on record in July.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Ben JobA customer uses an ATM machine near the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters, April 3, 2013.DUBAI/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs &lt;gs.n&gt; is reviving plans to issue at least $500 million worth of Islamic bonds, a sign that Islamic finance is going mainstream as big conventional banks seek to tap Middle Eastern money. The U.S. bank will meet investors in Qatar next Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on the following day to discuss issuing sukuk, a document from lead managers of the sale said on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Goldman. If the issue then goes ahead, Goldman will become only the second non-Islamic bank to sell sukuk, after the Middle Eastern unit of HSBC &lt;hsba.l&gt; did a ground-breaking $500 million deal in 2011. Other global banks are poised to follow suit. In recent months, France’s Societe Generale &lt;sogn.pa&gt; and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ &lt;8306.T&gt;, Japan's largest lender, have been preparing to issue sukuk in Malaysia. An initial attempt by Goldman to sell sukuk in 2011 ran into controversy as some in the industry accused it of failing to follow Islamic principles, which include bans on the payment of interest and pure monetary speculation. But the U.S. bank is now returning to the market as the Islamic finance industry grows rapidly, fueled by booming economies in the Gulf and southeast Asia. New issues of sukuk so far this year total $85.9 billion through 456 deals globally, up from $74.9 billion through 558 deals a year earlier, according to data from Zawya, a Thomson Reuters company. Those volumes remain small compared to conventional finance, but are now big enough to make it worthwhile for Western borrowers to get in on the act. Governments in non-Muslim countries are also starting to issue sukuk; in June, Britain became the first Western government to do so, while Hong Kong, South Africa and Luxembourg all plan sales this year. For some investors, Goldman is a symbol of Western banking, and its first attempt to enter the sukuk market - a $2 billion issuance program registered with the Irish Stock Exchange three years ago - was dogged by suspicions that it might exploit Islamic finance. Some analysts suggested Goldman might use the proceeds of the issue to lend money to clients for interest, or that the issue might not trade at par value, which could also contravene sharia principles. Although Goldman insisted that these concerns were unfounded and Islamic scholars had given its 2011 plan adequate certification, it never made a public issue of sukuk. This time, the U.S. bank appears to taking pains to avoid controversy. The document from lead arrangers said it would use a wakala structure for its sukuk, instead of the murabaha structure planned in 2011. Murabaha is a cost-plus sale arrangement which is commonly used in some parts of the Islamic world but has been criticized by some scholars for being too close to conventional financial engineering. Goldman's latest plan may indicate that wakala, in which one party manages assets on behalf of another, is becoming the structure of choice for big global banks. The HSBC issue in 2011 was wakala, and Societe Generale and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ have both chosen that structure for their plans. Initial indications are that Goldman's new sukuk plan may be received positively by the market. The involvement of top Western banks could help to develop Islamic finance by expanding its investor base and the pool of expert bankers involved in it. "It has always been my view that it's good for them to make a comeback. This is a market that welcomes all kinds of issuers," Daud Bakar, chairman of the sharia advisory council under Malaysa's central bank, told Reuters. "They need to make sure there is full disclosure on what the underlying project is. Also they need to consult with sharia scholars." Mohamad Akram Ladlin, executive director at the International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance, said: "As with any issuance it is encouraged if the purpose of it is for good: to develop infrastructure, to enhance Islamic finance, for example. "The earlier controversy was with their background, their image in the industry. There were also issues with the structure of the sukuk. If they can overcome these, why not?" Goldman Sachs chose itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank &lt;adib.ad&gt;, Emirates NBD &lt;enbd.du&gt;, National Bank of Abu Dhabi &lt;nbad.ad&gt; and the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank &lt;ipo-naco.se&gt; to arrange the investor meetings, the document from lead managers said. The sukuk would be issued through a vehicle called JANY Sukuk Co and be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs. The issue is expected to be rated A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's and A by Fitch Ratings, identical to the ratings of the investment bank, the document added.

AP ImagesMario Draghi.European Central Bank president Mario Draghi held a news conference after the latest monetary policy decision from the ECB saw the bank unexpectedly cut interest rates. Draghi announced that the ECB would begin a quantitative easing program in October, comprised of asset-backed securities and euro-denominated covered bonds. Draghi said the ECB was unanimous in its commitment to using additional and unconventional instruments if needed to address risks of a prolonged period of inflation. Draghi said the economic recovery in Europe was likely to be dampened by: unemployment, balance sheet adjustments in the private and public sectors, and negative loan growth. The ECB also cut its 2014 and 2015 GDP projections, while revising its 2016 projection upward. The ECB expects 2014 GDO of 0.9%, down from a prior view of 1%, while 2015 GDP is expected to come in at 1.6% against previous expectations for 1.7%. In 2016, the ECB sees GDP growing at 1.9%, up from 1.8% previously. Draghi also acknowledged that heightened geopolitical risks may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. The ECB said it expected inflation to remain low through 2016. Expectations for inflation in 2014 are 0.6%; 1.1% in 2015; and 1.4% in 2016. As he did in Jackson Hole, Draghi again said that fiscal policies had hurt economic growth, and he said that euro-area countries should not unravel the economic progress made with fiscal consolidation. Draghi added that important structural steps had been taken in some eurozone countries but not in others. The full text of Draghi's prepared comments can be read here.  Draghi said in response to a question that the ECB's rate decision was not unanimous. He said additional easing measures were discussed, with some members wanting to do more than announced Thursday, and others wanting to do less.  Draghi also said that a broader asset purchase program was discussed. In response to a question about what he considered quantitative easing, or QE, Draghi said QE was the outright purchase of assets and could be based on private- or public-sector assets, or both. Draghi said that Thursday's measures were oriented toward "credit easing" but that it was also clear the ECB would buy outright the senior tranche of asset-backed securities. Draghi also said that it was difficult to immediately assess the size of the program announced on Thursday. Draghi said most of the reason behind the decision to act at Thursday's meeting was tied to the downward movement in inflation indicators in August. With regard to interest rates, and banks that are considering participating in the ECB's first TLTRO, or targeted long-term refinancing operation, Draghi said: "We are at the lower bound." Draghi said the ECB staff saw a return of inflation because of recovery, exchange rates, monetary policy, and the increase of certain goods, notably food.  Draghi said that for central banks, it was hard to reach inflation goals only based on monetary policy. "You need growth, you need low unemployment, and for that, you need other things," Draghi said.  Draghi said there was no "grand bargain" but added that bankers and politicians "simply need to do their own jobs." Draghi said that in urging structural reforms, countries shouldn't lose sovereignty but share sovereignty the way they do with the eurozone.  Inflation expectations are still anchored, Draghi said, but the ECB has seen downside risks for inflation expectations increasing.  Also regarding inflation, Draghi said there had been low inflation but not deflation. Draghi said there had been several forecast errors in inflation expectations and that the price of food and energy had been a major part of this miscalculation. He added that unemployment and currency appreciation had added to this of late. The ECB cut its main refinancing rate to 0.05%, its marginal lending facility to 0.3%, and its deposit facility to -0.2%. These rates were expected to remain unchanged at 0.15%, 0.4%, and -0.1%, respectively. FREE AppDownload

APJeb Bush speaking in January 2014. Greg Valliere, the chief political strategist of the Potomac Research Group, released a new list handicapping the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday. His new ranking had former Florida Governor Jeb Bush on top after coming in at third in Valliere's previous list, in May.  Valliere's list, which he permitted Business Insider to republish, also shows the 2012 GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz climbing. The news wasn't good for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Senator and 2012 candidate Rick Santorum, and ex-Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who all dropped several spots.  Check out Valliere's top 10 below: 10.  Mike Pence (previously 10): The Indiana governor is making just enough noise to stay on the list, keeping his vice presidential chances very much alive. Pence appeals to all wings of the party — no easy feat. 9.  Scott Walker (previously 2): The Wisconsin governor was the insiders' pick last winter; now he's in a close fight to win re-election this fall. It's hard to see a hanging offense amid all the allegations about his fundraising — The New York Times was particularly outrageous in its treatment of him — but politics ain't always fair, and Walker's halo has slipped.  8.  Rick Santorum (previously 3): The biggest surprise of the 2012 campaign (he won eleven primaries), Santorum probably will run again with enthusiastic backing from the religious right. He's been AWOL lately, but if Santorum wins Iowa, he could stay in the race for a very long time. 7:  Paul Ryan: He wasn't on our Top Ten list in May, and he could be No. 1 or 2 by next summer. For now, we think Ryan is determined to polish his resume by passing tax reform next year; if a bill is through the House by summer, speculation about a presidential bid will intensify. The irony: Ryan deserves respect as the GOP "ideas guy," but many of his ideas poll poorly.  6.  Chris Christie (previously 6): He's spending a fortune on lawyers, and a suspicion persists that more dirt will come out, but the feisty New Jersey governor is still a major player. Christie could win 270 electoral votes, and not everyone on this list can claim that. Is Christie running? Oh yeah. 5.  Mitt Romney:  (previously 9): We're not kidding, listing Romney this high. If no one has emerged from the pack a year from now, the pressure on Romney will be enormous. Like most politicians, Romney lives in an adoring echo chamber; everyone tells him he'd be a great president and could win this time — and his disavowals haven't exactly been Shermanesque, have they? 4.  Ted Cruz  (previously 8): The base loves this guy, maybe even more than the base loves Rand Paul. Most Republicans in Washington loathe Cruz, which actually may be an attribute. We rarely pass on an opportunity to joke about his Canadian birth, but that will not deter Cruz — he's running and he's a serious candidate. Minor problem: if he's on the ticket, the GOP won't win more than a dozen states. 3.  Rand Paul (previously 4): He's an eye surgeon who happens to be a politician who can electrify young people at Berkeley or African-Americans at the Urban League. Many of his positions, especially regarding Israel, need work, and he has a long paper trail that will be used against him. But in an era that hates politicians, Paul doesn't always act like one, which is a major part of his appeal.  2.  Marco Rubio: (previously 1): He's a difficult candidate to handicap. Insiders are down on Rubio because of his flip-flopping on immigration, but around the country his narrative resonates with middle-class voters. Reporters say he seems jittery and cotton-mouthed in major speeches; plus there's the "gravitas factor," and the jury is still out on that. We could envision Rubio in the final three — or blowing out early. 1.  Jeb Bush: (previously 3): We hate succumbing to the consensus, but he's the favorite — if he wants the nomination. We think Jeb hasn't decided yet; there are family concerns and strong differences with the GOP base on key issues. But the base wants a winner, and this is a talented and intelligent politician who could give Hillary Clinton a tougher challenge than any of the others on this list. Valliere also identified several hopefuls he described as being "not quite in the top 10." This B-Team included Texas Governor Rick Perry, who Valliere said "always seems to do something to hurt his cause," Ohio Governor John Kasich, Dr. Ben Carson, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and Huckabee.

Thomson ReutersPeople fill up job applications during a job fair in San JoseNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies hired 204,000 workers in August, below what analysts had projected as well as the level set in July, a report by a payrolls processor released on Thursday showed. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast that the ADPNational Employment Report would show 220,000 jobs added in the month. In July, 212,000 jobs were added, according to the revised data, a level that was well off the 281,000 added in June. June's reading was the strongest since November 2012. The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.  (Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
Rightmove.co.ukThe house was listed on Rightmove.co.uk for £235,000. Houses for sale below the $411,000 stamp duty threshold are thin on the ground in London — quite literally in the case of one two-bedroom property in the north of the capital, which is up for auction. Measuring just 84-inches wide, the terrace home in Haringey is barely the width of three wheelie bins. The house, which appears to have been squeezed onto what was once a driveway between two more conventionally sized homes, will go on under the hammer on Oct. 1 and is expected to fetch more than the guide price of $386,000. Buyers will have to sit under the stairs in the super-slim living room, but they do also get a roof terrace. “I think it will appeal to owner-occupiers or perhaps an investor,” said James McHugh of estate agent McHugh &amp; Co, who is handling the sale. A buy-to-let landlord, he said, could rent out the corridor-shaped home for about $2,100 a month. Wider homes on the same street have been changing hands for much more — a three-bedroom terrace is currently on the market for $954,000 — and in a part of London where house prices increased by 23% in the year to July there are slim pickings for homebuyers who cannot raise considerable sums of money. It is not the narrowest house in London — it is a whole foot wider than a 6-foot-wide home in Shepherd’s Bush, which changed hands for $904,000 in 2009.

ADP said private payrolls climbed just 204,000 in August. Consensus was for an increase of 220,000. Today's reading is below July's 212,000 gain. Still, it was the fifth-straight month of +200,000 jobs gains. "The key point here is that after a run of volatility triggered initially by the severe winter, ADP's number is now back on track, simply telling us what happened in the official data the previous month," Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson writes. "Remember, the ADP number is generated by a model which incorporates both current month data from companies using ADP for payroll processing and hard data from the previous month, reflecting the tendency for payroll gains to mean-revert over time. We are sticking to our 250K forecast for tomorrow." The service sector added 190,000, while goods-producing industries added 41,000.  Here's what their current chart now looks like: ADP And here's the long view: ADP The smallest-sized firms continue to outpace all other firm sizes in post-2008 jobs growth.

ReutersThe historic slowdown in healthcare spending growth over the past few years will come to an end in 2014, according to a new report from actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released Wednesday. For year, primary driver of future projected debt and deficits has been the growth of federal healthcare spending, something that has alarmed economists as a wave of Baby Boomers continues to retire and more people are added to the Medicare and Medicaid rolls.  But over the past four years, healthcare spending has grown at a historically slow rate — a credit to reforms in the Affordable Care Act and elsewhere, as well as a sluggish economy. The spending slowdown has lasted longer than many experts predicted.  But by 2023, spending on healthcare will amount to about 19.3% of the nation's economy, according to the new CMS report, which was published in the journal Health Affairs on Wednesday. The report projects spending on healthcare will increase about 6% each year from 2015-23, a marked increase from below 4% in each of the past four years. The increase, however, is slightly lower than the historical average growth of 7.2% annually from 1990-2008, a fact the Obama administration emphasized in calling the report "encouraging." Overall, spending on healthcare will rise more than 1% faster than GDP. The chart below shows the growth rate of national health expenditures vs. the growth of GDP. The arrow signifies the point upon which the slowdown will end: CMS The actuaries said the primary drivers of the tick upward in healthcare spending would be increased coverage under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the federal Medicaid program, an aging economy that keeps adding itself to the Medicare and Medicaid rolls, and an improving economy. The actuaries estimated that in total through private insurance plans and through Medicaid expansion, more than 17 million people would be added to insurance rolls and Medicaid by the end of next year. "The period in which healthcare has accounted for a stable share of economic output is projected to end in 2014, primarily because of the coverage expansions of the Affordable Care Act," the report read. By 2023, national healthcare spending will total about $5.2 trillion, the report said, an increase from $2.9 trillion over the previous decade. Some observers were quick to point out some hidden positives in the report that were rather obscured by its top lines. The actuaries' estimate of healthcare spending in the year 2019, for example, is now more than $500 billion lower than what it was four years ago, Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt pointed out on Twitter. And Medicare spending growth is projected to peak in 2020, as the swath of Baby Boomers retiring begins to taper off. The White House said the long-term trends on healthcare spending growth remain "encouraging." In an analysis, Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Barack Obama, said that if even one-third of the current slowdown in healthcare spending persists, it would save Americans nearly $1,200 on average. "These savings would ultimately accrue to Federal and State governments in the form of lower costs for health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid and to families in the form of higher wages and lower out-of-pocket costs," Furman wrote.

Yahoo Finance Yesterday, Apple's stock hit a wall, falling 4.22%.  In early pre-market trading, the stock is off another .24%, down to $98.70. Although, it was down as much as 1%, so it seems to be bouncing back. Until yesterday, Apple had been safely above $100 for two weeks, and was hitting all-time highs as anticipation built for the iPhone 6 and the iWatch.  So, why is it down now? There are two simple, superficial reasons for the stock be falling. Apple's celeb nudie scandal, and a note from Pacific Crest warning people that it might be time to get out of Apple stock. There's a third reason, and we'll get to that, as well. A bunch of starlets who use iPhones had their personal photos end up on the Internet. The people that posted them to the web blamed Apple's iCloud, and the consensus seems to be that they were able to gain access relatively easily through Apple's weak security. APKate Upton is one of the people hit by the iCloud hacking This happened at the absolute worst time for Apple since it's about to introduce the iPhone 6, and iOS 8, the latest version of its mobile software. In iOS 8, one of the great features is that you can store all of your photos in iCloud, not just the last 30 days worth of photos. But how many people are going to be enticed by that now? iCloud looks vulnerable, and Apple looks untrustworthy. The iPhone 6 is also expected to have a mobile payments system. Are people going to trust Apple with sensitive financial and banking information? It's also expected that the iPhone 6 in conjunction with Apple's iWatch will collect personal health information. If Apple can't be trusted with naked photos of the famous, can it be trusted with deeply personal health information? RozetkedThe iPhone 6, supposedly, on the left compared to an iPhone 5S. The celeb scandal didn't knock down Apple's shares on Tuesday, the first day the stock traded after the news broke. Perhaps investors didn't immediately appreciate the magnitude of the crisis, or perhaps they don't think people really care about privacy. (This is not a radical stance to take, since people don't actually care about privacy anymore.) Apple's shares really lost steam yesterday after Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest put out a note saying that people should "take profits" on Apple trades. That means if an investor has been lucky enough to enjoy Apple's ~45% increase over the past year, now might be the time to sell.  Hargreaves' core thesis for selling Apple is pretty simple. He's basically calling for a repeat of what happened with the iPhone 5. He thinks Apple will sell a lot of iPhone units to people that are upgrading, but after that initial burst, he sees growth slowing significantly, which sinks the stock. Apple has new products coming — the iWatch, mobile payments — but at Apple's scale, those products will barely move the needle, says Hargreaves.  Morgan StanleyApple's shares after iPhone launches It's possible investors read Hargreaves' note and decided to sell, but there's a few problems with that theory. In all honesty, Hargreaves' note was somewhat wimpy. He tries to have it both ways. He says Apple shares could still rise as the iPhone 6 sells. And he even recommends holding shares. He also maintains his 'overweight' rating and merely warns that he might downgrade the stock if things don't go well. Plus, on Tuesday Gene Munster raised his target on Apple. And a few weeks ago Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley laid out a compelling case that this time is not like the iPhone 5.  So, you have to think that Hargreaves' note was more powerful than the notes from Huberty and Munster if you think that's what sank the stock.  And, again, if you want to blame the iCloud scandal, you have to explain the one-day delay in the stock drop. So, what's a third reason to explain Apple's sudden slip? Something else happened, and we don't know what it is. Stocks are weird! And they sometimes rise or fall for reasons that aren't immediately apparent. With Apple shares going from -1.1% to -.29% (just while we've written this) it looks like whatever happened yesterday may have been an odd blip.  FREE AppDownload
© AFP Michal CizekToys on display at the Lego factory in Kladno, Central Bohemia, on December 13, 2006Copenhagen (AFP) - Danish toy maker Lego has taken the top spot as the world's biggest maker of toys by sales, overtaking Barbie doll-maker Mattel, its first-half results showed on Thursday. First-half sales rose 11.0 percent to 11.5 billion kroner (1.55 billion euros, $2.03 billion). Performance was boosted by the Lego Movie product line which was launched together with the group's eponymous feature film earlier this year. "It is too early to say if the strong performance will be reflected in the full year results," chief financial officer John Goodwin said in a statement. "The majority of Lego sales to consumers happen in the second half of the calendar year in a short time span of a few weeks leading up to the  holiday season," he said. Net profit rose 14 percent to 2.7 billion kroner, also putting it ahead of Mattel, which reported disappointing first-half results in July as sales of Barbie continued to decline. Mattel bought Canadian Lego rival Mega Brands -- which makes plastic building blocks directly in competition with the Danish group's products -- for $460 million in February. Lego is looking to grow in Asia, where sales are relatively small compared to sales in the mature markets of Europe and North America. "China saw the most significant growth in consumer sales in the region by more than 50 percent," the company said. FREE AppDownload

AP ImagesMario DraghiThe European Central Bank just unexpectedly cut rates. The ECB's main refinancing rate has been cut to 0.05%, its marginal lending facility is at 0.3%, and its deposit facility remains in negative territory at -0.2%. Expectations were for these rates to remain at 0.15%, 0.4%, and -0.1%, respectively.  Following this announcement, the euro is making new lows against the U.S. dollar, falling to less than $1.31 against the dollar. ECB president Mario Draghi is set to being his press conference at 8:30 am ET, where he will expand on this decision, which was not anticipated by the market. A report from Reuters just ahead of the ECB's announcement said that the ECB is preparing to purchase up to 500 billion Euros worth of bonds as part of an easing program to help bolster the flagging Eurozone economy.  Following the report, Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, "In one line: Surprise rate cuts point to currency now being a key policy tool." Vistesen added: "The further tweak in conventional monetary policy was a surprise, given the governing council had noted that the central bank was essentially already at its lower bound. The only real interpretation that makes sense here is that the governing council now sees the currency as an active and important policy tool."  Here's the full statement from the ECB: At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 10 basis points to 0.05%, starting from the operation to be settled on 10 September 2014. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 10 basis points to 0.30%, with effect from 10 September 2014. FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were higher on Thursday, ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting and a flurry of economic data, including two reports on the U.S. labor market. Futures added to gains in the wake of a Reuters report that said the ECB would discuss plans to launch an asset-backed securities and covered bond purchase program worth up to 500 billion euros at a policy meeting Thursday. A rate decision is due at 7:45 a.m. EDT (1145 GMT), with a press conference to follow at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). Investors will peruse a host of economic data for insight into the health of the labor market ahead of Friday's payrolls report. These include the August ADP employment report scheduled for 8:15 a.m. (1215 GMT) and weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). ADP data is expected to show the private sector added 220,000 jobs last month while claims are expected to show a slight increase to 300,000 from 298,000 in the prior week. Also due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) are second quarter productivity and July international trade data. Those will be followed by two reports on the services sector, with the August Markit Services PMI scheduled for release at 9:45 a.m. (1345 GMT) and the Institute for Supply Management's August non-manufacturing PMI at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures  were up 7 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a higher open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures  rose 44 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  added 11.5 points. Tibco Software  rose 6 percent to $22.30 in premarket trade after the business software maker said it was reviewing its strategic and financial alternatives as part of a process initiated by its board on Aug. 16 to maximize shareholder value. Ciena Corp  shares slumped 11.8 percent to $18.05 before the opening bell after the network equipment company posted third-quarter results and provided its fourth-quarter outlook. Joy Global  slipped 1.4 percent to $61.35 in light premarket trade after the mining equipment maker posted lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit and narrowed its full-year earnings forecast range. European shares erased earlier losses to gain slightly after the report on the ECB's policy considerations. Asian shares steadied near seven-year highs, underpinned by hopes of a ceasefire in Ukraine, although a cautious mood prevailed before the ECB meeting.  (Editing by Bernadette Baum) FREE AppDownload

Here's what you need to know today 1)  European Central Bank Discussing Securities-Buying Program. Reuters' Mike Peacock reports the ECB is considering launching an asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bond purchase program worth up to 500 billion euros. "ECB President Mario Draghi will likely announce such a program at his news conference unless it comes up against strong opposition at the Governing Council's policy meeting," he writes. "The program would have a duration of three years and comprise both ABS and covered bond purchases. The ECB could begin buying the assets this year, the people familiar with the discussions told Reuters." 2)  Bank Of Japan Unchanged. Despite the Japanese economy's having contracted at the fastest rate since early 2011, BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said the plan increase the country's monetary base by Y60tn to Y70tn per year remained in place. "Analysts weren't expecting a change but many believe deteriorating economic data and slowing inflation will force the hand of the bank, as it aims to increase the country's monetary base by Y60tn to Y70tn per year with a goal of hitting 2 per cent inflation by next year," the FT writes, adding, "The BoJ continually pledges that it will loosen policy if necessary, but so far it's remained relatively upbeat about the economy. Besides, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda tends to say it's structural reforms, not monetary loosening, that the country needs." 3)  Bank of England Unchanged. Gov. Mark Carney announced he would keep rates at 0.5%, as expected, and would continue to target 375 billion sterling's worth of asset purchases. 4)  Goldman Warns On Scotland Vote. The bank, along with two other groups, says a Eurozone style financial crisis could erupt in Britain if Scotland votes to secede.

[Outgoing CEO Dan] Doctoroff, 56, a former deputy mayor of New York and private equity executive, told Mr. Bloomberg about two weeks ago that he planned to resign, frustrated with how the leadership dynamic had shifted. Mr. Bloomberg urged him to stay and remain chief executive, but Mr. Doctoroff demurred." 7) German GDP Forecast Slashed. The HWWI economic institute has cut German 2014 GDP forecast to 1.6% from 2.2%, and for 2015 from 2.5% to 2%, on the lowered dynamism of the eurozone and geopolitical risks, according to Die Welt's Holger Zschaepitz. 8)  Mobileye Is Down. Shares in the assisted driving software developer are off 3.1% after reporting flat year-over-year GAAP earnings.

Other banks working on the e-commerce company's IPO were eager for the role, also known as the stabilization agent, because of the status and the potential of additional fees associated with it, the source said. Stabilization agents support the share price by purchasing additional shares on the market. Barclays Plc &lt;barc.l&gt; will be the lead floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange, the source added. A date for the IPO has not been announced but is expected next week.

Thomson ReutersEuropean Central Bank President Draghi speaks during the bank's monthly news conference in Frankfurt(Reuters) - Plans to launch an asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bond purchase program worth up to 500 billion euros are on the table at Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting, people familiar with the discussions say. ECB President Mario Draghi will likely announce such a program at his news conference unless it comes up against strong opposition at the Governing Council's policy meeting. The program would have a duration of three years and comprise both ABS and covered bond purchases. The ECB could begin buying the assets this year, the people familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The ECB declined to comment. ECB President Mario Draghi said in Jackson Hole on Aug. 22 that the ECB's preparations for an ABS purchase program were "fast moving forward and we expect that it should contribute to further credit easing". The ECB has been developing such a program with a view to stimulating the ABS market and offering smaller businesses an alternative source of funding. However, bankers and regulators have cast doubt on reviving Europe's repackaged debt market to fund economic recovery, saying it will take years and hinge on a re-invention of the sector rather than quick regulatory tweaks. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said last month that European governments may have to support Europe's market for securitized debt by issuing guarantees to make it a successful alternative source of funding to bank loans.   (Editing by Mike Peacock) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersChina Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 planes are seen at an airport in TaiyuanBEIJING (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Thursday it expects China to need more than 6,020 aircraft in the next 20 years, an 8 percent rise over last year's two-decade estimate, as growing overseas leisure travel drives demand for single-aisle and wide body planes. The aircraft maker's new estimate of 6,020 planes, valued at $870 billion (528.91 billion pounds), is up from the 5,580 it estimated last year and represents a near tripling of China's current fleet. The country, the world's second-biggest aircraft market, is essential to Boeing's long-term global strategy. "New business models like low-cost carrier, regional carriers are driving demand for more direct flights to more destinations," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, speaking at a media briefing in Beijing. Boeing expects China to overtake the United States as the world's single-biggest aircraft market in the period through 2032. Chinese airlines are increasingly training their sights on overseas routes as the domestic market cools amid a slowing economy and government budget austerity. The overseas push is also fueled by rising numbers of outbound leisure travelers, expected to double to 200 million by 2020, according to brokerage CLSA. Besides intensifying its coverage of neighboring countries, Air China alone has opened three new routes to the United States since July, 2013, including launching a three-time weekly service to Honolulu in January, 2014. The last time it launched new flights to the United States was in the early 1980s. China Southern Airlines, the largest carrier on China-Australia routes, started flying non-stop to New York last month.

REUTERS/Issei KatoA worker holds silver pachinko balls at a pachinko parlour in Fukaya, north of Tokyo July 15, 2014.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union is discussing delaying a deadline for a second time in its efforts to reform the global derivatives market, a source familiar with the matter said, as talks with U.S. regulators have failed to produce a breakthrough on a main sticking point. The two sides are still at odds on allowing clearing houses, which stand between buyers and sellers of derivatives to reduce risk, to operate in each others' jurisdictions. The impasse is adding uncertainty for U.S. clearing houses, which are concerned about losing business, while another delay would be a setback in reining in the $710 trillion market that was core to the financial crisis. "Last year, there was optimism that we would move fast on a system where there would be more reliance on each other. I think it's fair to say that that has not gone as quickly as we had hoped," Steven Maijoor, the head of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in an interview. The main point of contention is that the U.S. swaps regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is standing by its view that European clearing houses must comply with U.S. rules when operating in America, rather than relying on their home regulator's rules, the source said. That, in turn, is a legal obstacle for Brussels to declare the U.S. rules equivalent to its own. The EU needs to make such a declaration in order for U.S. clearing houses, such as that run by CME Group, to keep doing business in Europe beyond a Dec. 15 deadline. If the stalemate is not solved by that date, European banks will need to hold far higher capital buffers for deals cleared through U.S. firms, and could take their business to clearing houses in countries recognized by Europe. In a sign of how little hope regulators have of breaking the impasse, EU regulators are moving toward delaying the deadline after an earlier six-month delay, according to the source. The CFTC declined to comment. CFTC Chairman Tim Massad said in July that the two sides were working on "appropriate deference" but that coordinating the rules would take time.

Swaps are derivatives that were first designed to protect companies and investors against financial risks. Long unregulated, they ballooned in the heady days before the crisis when speculators started piling into them. They played a major role in the 2007-09 financial meltdown, most notably when insurance firm AIG was hit by massive losses after risky derivatives bets went sour, and regulators across the world have since agreed to tighten the rules. The standoff threatens to delay a global framework that would give supervisors more insight into the risks these once opaque markets harbor, while at the same time allowing banks and their clients to operate across borders. In a snub to the United States, Europe in June publicly excluded it from a list of countries whose rules for clearing houses Europe deemed equivalent with those of its own, which included Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. Industry groups have urged the two sides to cut a deal before Dec. 15, but the source said that Europe would not be able to let the U.S. clearing houses in as long as the CFTC continued to insist that European firms stuck to its rules. ESMA's Maijoor would not comment on postponing the deadline. He did say he was optimistic that there would soon be an agreement for ESMA, CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to cooperate on supervisory matters. The CFTC is examining whether U.S. banks are evading another set of rules that forces swaps trading onto regulated platforms, by removing financial guarantees for transactions done from European subsidiaries. But Maijoor said that while the regulator also had seen this happening, it emphasized the need to work together on myriad new rules for derivatives markets.

With higher risks come higher rewards. That's one of the most basic rules of investing. However, it's also one of the most misinterpreted rules. "We hear it all the time: 'Riskier investments produce higher returns' and 'If you want to make more money, take more risk,'" posits Oaktree Capital's Howard Marks. "Both of these formulations are terrible." Marks believes investors deserve a more complete explanation of the risk-return relationship. "[T]here’s another, better way to describe this relationship: 'Investments that seem riskier have to appear likely to deliver higher returns, or else people won’t make them,'" Marks writes in new memo to clients. "This makes perfect sense. If the market is rational, the price of a seemingly risky asset will be set low enough that the reward for holding it seems adequate to compensate for the risk present. But note the word “appear.” We’re talking about investors’ opinions regarding future return, not facts. Risky investments are — by definition — far from certain to deliver on their promise of high returns." Marks shared a brilliant risk-return chart from his book "The Most Important Thing." See below. "As you move to the right, increasing the risk: the expected return increases (as with the traditional graphic), the range of possible outcomes becomes wider, and the less-good outcomes become worse." The straight line going from the bottom right to the upper left is how most people envision the risk-return dynamic. However, it's the curves and vertical lines at each point that that every investor better be comfortable with. While the point represents what is expected to happen, curve represents the range of outcomes the will actually happen. "This is the essence of investment risk," Marks writes. "Riskier investments are ones where the investor is less secure regarding the eventual outcome and faces the possibility of faring worse than those who stick to safer investments, and even of losing money. These investments are undertaken because the expected return is higher. But things may happen other than that which is hoped for. Some of the possibilities are superior to the expected return, but others are decidedly unattractive." Brilliant. Oaktree Capital FREE AppDownload

It's very likely that something has to give here." "I don't remember any time in my career where there have been as many wildcards floating out there that have the potential to be very significant and alter people's thinking," he said. "If there's a change in confidence or some international event that changes the dynamics, people could in effect take a different position with reference to the market." "It's almost every company that's missed has missed on the revenue side, which is a reflection that there's a demand issue," he said. "When you got a demand issue it's hard to imagine the stock market at an all-time high." He also lamented about how difficult it is to call a market top. "If you're wrong on when, that's a problem." His answer: "You got to tiptoe ... and find the right balance." "This is the first time I ever remember where having cash isn't such a terrible thing, despite the fact that interest rates are as low as they are," he added. On Obama and inequality... "Part of the impact of these very, very low interest rates is that we've creating this disparity. The wealthy are benefiting from government policy and the nonwealthy aren't," he continued. "So we have a president who says we've got to fight this disparity and we have a Fed who's encouraging it every day." On Tax Inversion... "This is both legal and accepted. If the government doesn't like the result, change the law," he said. "You have to have a rational tax policy." He said the top tax rate should be changed and the U.S. should not tax worldwide income. Zell also said it's unfortunate that "this inversion thing has been captured as a political, electioneering item."

Wikimedia CommonsFrankfurt (AFP) - German industrial orders, a key measure of demand for German-made goods both at home and abroad, jumped in July, suggesting the fallout from the Ukraine crisis remains limited for now, data showed on Thursday. Factory orders were up 4.6 percent in July compared with the level in June, the statistics office Destatis said in a statement.  In June, German factory orders had declined by 2.7 percent.  The office said that orders growth was driven mainly by strong foreign demand, with export orders advancing by as much as 6.9 percent, and domestic orders up 1.7 percent.  A regional breakdown showed that orders from the eurozone climbed by 1.7 percent and orders from outside the eurozone soared by 9.8 percent. The headline figure was overstated by a disproportionately large number of bulk orders, the economy ministry said in Berlin. However, "after the uncertainty triggered by geopolitical developments and the economic soft patch in the second quarter, the strong rise in orders is an encouraging sign for industry," the ministry said in a statement. Analysts said the data suggested that the feared fallout from the crisis in Ukraine was not proving quite so severe as expected.  "After a long series of negative surprises in data in recent weeks, the strong orders number is grounds for some optimism," said BayernLB economist Stefan Kipar.  "It suggests that day-to-day business in Germany has not suffered unduly under the Ukraine-Russia conflict." But the data should not be over-interpreted, the expert cautioned.  "There is a risk in the coming months that the uncertainty will make itself felt a lot more in the hard data," he warned.  Berenberg Bank economist Christian Schulz also believed that "the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and Western sanctions on German exports is limited." Nevertheless, the key effect of the crisis was the uncertainty it caused, he said.  "Only if the situation in Ukraine stabilizes will confidence and thus growth rebound." ING DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski predicted the German economy "should return to growth in the third quarter."  The data "should give some relief that not everything is gloom and down," he said.  UniCredit economist Andreas Rees said that "all the talk about geopolitical tensions and their swift impact on German hard data was wrong and largely exaggerated.  "The Russian-Ukrainian crisis does not resemble the Lehman shock with its swift and brutal impact we had gone through six years ago," he said.  "We think that at least a moderate rebound of German economic activity in the third quarter is in the pipeline" after a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter, Rees concluded.   FREE AppDownload
Daniel Goodman / Business Insider(Reuters) - Investigators working on the cyber attack at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co have found clues that a global network of computers available for hire was used to send the stolen data to a Russian city, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the ongoing probe at the bank. JPMorgan's own investigators have identified what they believe to be the assault's staging ground, called a "bulletproof" hosting platform because of its resilience to other attackers and to law enforcement, the report said. (http://bloom.bg/1vQrXvC) The attackers used a network of servers that are commandeered without their legitimate owners' knowledge through hacking or fraud, according to the report. The report said a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin dismissed any Russian involvement in the attack. JPMorgan last week said it was working with law enforcement authorities to determine the scope of the attack. It disclosed the probe after the FBI said it was investigating media reports about several U.S. financial companies becoming victims of recent cyber attacks. JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by Arnab Sen in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) FREE AppDownload
Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Three separate reports published by economic experts warn a separate Scotland would require deep public spending cuts and lead to higher interest charges for mortgage holders. Scottish independence would herald a new wave of painful public spending cuts, an increase in mortgage costs and a eurozone-style currency crisis, economic experts have warned amid claims “the penny is finally dropping” about the dangers. City analysts from Goldman Sachs and Berenberg, a German-based multinational bank, published reports concluding a Yes vote would force Scotland into deeper austerity, requiring a “significant reduction in the provision of public services” to gets its finances in order. In a separate analysis, Iain McLean, professor of politics at Oxford University, predicted every Scot would be £480 worse off under independence now thanks to sharply declining oil revenues. All three agreed that a separate Scotland would pay a higher interest rate on its borrowing, an additional cost that would be passed onto borrowers and mortgage holders. David Cameron on Wednesday warned this hike would be even higher if Alex Salmond made good his “chilling” threat to refuse to accept a share of the U.K.’s national debt, adding the consequences would be “crippling” for the Scottish people. Goldman Sachs also predicted a eurozone-style financial crisis could hit both Scotland and the remainder of the U.K., with uncertainty over a currency union causing a run on assets and deposits based north of the Border. Alex Salmond has said the three main U.K. parties are bluffing by ruling out a formal deal to share the pound, but the global investment bank concluded the warning was “credible.” The reports were published the day after the pound slumped as panic swept the money markets over an opinion poll showing the No lead has shrunk to only six points. This prompted Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to state Wednesday: “The penny is finally dropping about the pound, and the reality of the true dangers of independence is beginning to dawn (on people).” The YouGov survey showed increasing numbers of Scots think they would be better off after independence and the future of the NHS would be brighter if they vote Yes. But Goldman Sachs warned a separate Scotland faces a “significant budget adjustment” to make its finances “sustainable” as it currently receives much higher public spending from the Treasury thanks to the Barnett formula. As Scotland has a more rapidly ageing population than the U.K. as a whole, Kevin Daly, the bank’s senior economist, said this advantage would most likely increase over the coming decades if there is a No vote. “Filling this gap in the event of independence would be painful and is likely to require a significant reduction in the provision of public services. In the long run, an independent Scotland would likely have a smaller public sector,” Daly said. However, he said the most worrying risk was that uncertainty over the currency would lead to a eurozone-style crisis after a Yes vote but before Scotland had seceded from the U.K. He disagreed the U.K. parties were bluffing over rejecting a currency union, saying the euro crisis shows that such an arrangement needs “political and fiscal integration.” “It is difficult to see the rest of the U.K. agreeing to provide a monetary and financial backstop to Scotland,” he added. Even if a deal could be reached, the Goldman Sachs analysis concluded the threat of it breaking up “would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets, and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from Scottish-based banks.” Although the Bank of England could step in to “prevent the worst” consequences of a bank run before Scotland left the U.K., it said the bank could not “credibly commit” to this after separation had occurred. Daly also warned that a narrow No victory on Sept. 18 could lead to calls “reasonably quickly” for another referendum to be staged. Berenberg agreed a separate Scotland’s financial position would require “significant further austerity.” “Government borrowing costs would be higher and there would probably be economic disruption from a new Scottish currency … Overall, we judge that the few years following the vote would be tough but not calamitous,” it said. The analysis said both governments would want a quick deal for a “velvet divorce” but suggested that Salmond would have to make the most concessions as the Scottish economy “would be the epicenter of any downturn.” In a report sent to the Daily Telegraph, McLean said official figures showed that if Scotland separated now, its finances would be £2.5 billion deeper in the red than if it remained part of the U.K. thanks to falling oil revenues. This would mean each Scot paying an extra £480 in tax if they wanted to maintain the current standard of public services, he said, or making cuts to spending on the NHS, education system, or the state pension. He said it was impossible to say whether a separate Scotland would be wealthier in the long term, as this would depend on the policies adopted by its government, but “everyone” would have to pay higher interest on their loans and mortgages. “What is sheer magical thinking is that people will be better off on Independence Day, with more to spend on the NHS. On the latest available numbers, they will be worse off, with less to spend on the NHS unless they cut spending somewhere else,” he concluded. He sent the analysis as Alistair Darling used a visit to Aberdeen, during which he spoke to oil industry leaders, to warn that independence would mean putting Scotland’s schools and hospitals at the mercy of “a volatile and declining resource.” Darling, the leader of the pro-U.K. Better Together campaign, highlighted a report by the impartial Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warning that Scotland would have to make an additional £6 billion of spending cuts and tax increases in the first years of independence. The former Labour Chancellor said: “Independence wouldn’t put an end to austerity — it would make it worse.” Jackie Baillie, a Labour MSP, added: “This is half the NHS budget in Scotland. It's no wonder Goldman Sachs say the cuts would be painful.” Ian McDougall, board member of the pro-separation Business for Scotland group, said: “It's our reasoning, and clearly Goldman Sachs' reasoning, that it's in Westminster's best interests to move quickly to agree a currency union. Anything else would be tantamount to cutting off their nose to spite their face.” FREE AppDownload
