The Nikkei hit a fresh 5.5-year high after soaring 1.9% to 15,942.60 on Thursday. But it then went red falling as much as 0.5%, only to climb back up 0.3%. The recent rally in Japanese stocks has been attributed to 'Abenomics' ó Japan's aggressive stimulus campaign under prime minister Shinzo Abe. Here's a chart from Yahoo Finance that shows the Nikkei's performance during Thursday's trading session: Yahoo Finance Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite is down 0.77% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng is down 1.7%. Remember we just saw Chinese manufacturing contract for the first time in seven months.
ReutersHSBC China Flash Manufacturing PMI fell to a seven-month low of 49.6 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. This missed expectations for manufacturing to hold steady at 50.4. "The cooling manufacturing activities in May reflected slower domestic demand and ongoing external headwinds," wrote Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC. "A sequential slowdown is likely in the middle of 2Q, casting downside risk to China‚Äôs fragile growth recovery. Moreover, the further signs of labour market slackness call for more policy support. Beijing still has fiscal ammunition to do so." A breakdown of the report showed that nearly all the sub-indices including new orders, new export orders, and employment decreased. Here's the complete breakdown: HSBC Markit Economics/HSBC Before tonight's data release,¬†Deutsche Bank's John Horner wrote that this month's "Flash PMI is even more important than usual." This he said was because Chinese data has recently disappointed markets and has once again raise questions about economic growth.¬† "Further weakness will heighten concerns of¬† a 'broken' Chinese growth dynamic that is no longer responding to rapid credit expansion."

Investors were happy enough with HP's beat on its earnings-per-share to drive the stock up over 13% in after hours trading (so far). But there were still some shocking numbers in its quarter, like how PC revenues tanked 20% year over year. Back in January, 2012, Whitman was saying about Windows 8, "We have to stick with this. I am a believer." On Wednesday, during a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Whitman played up HP's† non-Windows devices every chance she got: the $339†Pavilion 14 Chromebook laptop launched in February, and the $169 Slate 7 Android tablet launched last month. She explained that her strategy in the PC business is now to use "multiple operating systems, multiple architectures and multiple form factors. We are moving quickly to produce the devices that customers want," she said, adding: "Following the launch of our first Chromebook in February, we launched the new Slate 7." Later, when asked about how HP plans to grow revenues in 2014, Whitman mentioned these non-Windows devices again. "Listen, if we have the right product priced right, the channel still loves HP, and they want to sell in our [PC] products whether it's to small businesses, medium-sized business or the enterprise. And, frankly, having Android products helps a lot. This $169 Slate helps covers a segment of the market we didn't have before." Notice that she didn't mention Windows. Here's the chart shared with analysts today: HP
ND Strupler via FlickrThe housing market has been showing signs of strength. Economists expect home prices to rise 8% this year and then grow at a more modest pace beyond that.  Over the next five years, national home prices are projected to rise at an average 3.5% rate, according to the latest CoreLogic Case-Shiller report. Of course, there will be laggards. We drew on the latest data to identify the worst housing markets for the next five years ‚Äî the markets with the lowest home price growth. The 15 cities are ranked by the projected annualized change in home prices between Q4 2012 and Q4 2017. Note: The median family income and home price is for Q4 2012. Unemployment data is as of February 2013, and population data for the metros is for 2011.
Wall Street's top strategists have been scrambling to explain why the stock market has left their clients in the dust.

Business InsiderEurasia Group President Ian Bremmer and co-author Kenneth Hersh write in a New York Times op-ed today that America's domestic energy production renaissance will remake the world. "While this is not a free lunch, it should not be feared," they say. "The production process is complicated and expensive, and if the industry is not careful there can be risks to the environment. But the potential is staggering. Significant domestic job growth and economic expansion has begun." The impact will be felt in two forms: first, no longer will a handful of energy producers be able to control markets. That's because other countries are discovering that they too possess large shale deposits (even if initial investment has been slow). The other is that as America reduces its fossil fuel imports, it will not have as much interest in intervening in foreign markets. As the pair write: As America drives toward a new era of energy self-sufficiency, Washington will be less willing to risk lives and spends billions on ensuring the free flow of oil and gas through dangerous places. Thatís especially important for the Middle East ó a region where Ottomans, then Europeans, and lately Americans have, for better and for worse, helped keep the peace. The United States isnít about to abandon the region entirely, not with the global economy still so dependent on the flow of commerce through the Strait of Hormuz and Israelís security at risk. But itís natural that as America becomes less reliant on the Middle East for energy, Washingtonís willingness to accept risks and burdens there will diminish, or at least become harder to justify in a fiscally constrained era. As others have pointed out, Bremmer and Hersh also note that it's very possible China will step into the resulting void, which will create it's own set of issues.
2. Trade Like a Wizened Mercenary Soldier:¬†We must fight on the winning side, not on the side we may believe to be correct economically. 3. Mental Capital Trumps Real Capital: Capital comes in two types, mental and real, and the former is far more valuable than the latter.

Here's a geography question for you: What point on earth is the farthest from the center of the earth? Screengrab from YouTube The answer is actually not "the top of Mount Everest"--which was the answer that sprung into the mind of this 47-year old simpleton. I assumed that answer was too obvious to be correct, but I didn't have a better one. The good news is, if you had been competing in the National Geographic Bee like the 12-year old who just won it, the question would have been phrased in a way that made it clear that the answer wasn't Mount Everest: Because Earth bulges at the equator, the point that is farthest from Earth's center is the summit of a peak in Ecuador. Name this peak. Can you name that peak? Me, neither. But 12-year old¬†Sathwik Karnik could. The answer is "Chimborazo." Wikipedia By getting that and many other questions right, Sathwik won the Bee, a $25,000 scholarship, a trip to the Galapagos, and a lifetime subscription to National Geographic.

FINRA Is Considering A Proposal That Would Require Brokers To Disclose Bonuses To Their Clients (The Wall Street Journal) The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) CEO Richard Ketchum said the regulator would consider a proposal this July, that would require brokers to disclose their bonuses to clients. This would include any details on compensation of $50,000 or more including signing bonuses, back-end bonuses etc. "I think there's value in customers...being aware of some of the compensation issues, being able to ask the right type of questions," Ketchum said, according to The Wall Street Journal. Even if FINRA approves the proposal, it would also have to be approved by the SEC. 4 Lessons From The Stunning Fall In Apple And Gold (Advisor Perspectives)¬†  Apple and Gold have been taking a beating and the folks at Tuttle Tactical Management thinks that there are four lessons to be learned from from their decline. 1.

"Diversification for diversification's sake doesn't make sense." 4. Be wary of predictions.  T Rowe Price Plans To Launce New Target Date Funds In August (Investment News) T. Rowe Price Plans to launch target date funds ‚Äì mutual funds that rebalance assets based on a future date - in August. These will have about 42.5% of assets invested in equities at the target date. "Their existing funds have one of the most aggressive glide paths in the industry," Josh Charlson of Morningstar told Investment News. "They've defended it pretty robustly over the years, but the reality is, there are situations where they weren't able to get business ‚Äî or even get their foot in the door ‚Äî because there are plan sponsors who don't want to take on that kind of equity risk."  Hedge Fund Performance This Year Is Just Sad (Goldman Sachs) In its latest Hedge Fund Monitor report, Goldman Sachs points out that hedge funds have been underperforming. "The typical hedge fund generated a YTD return of 5% through May 10, compared with 15% gains for both the S&amp;P 500 and the average large-cap core mutual fund," wrote Goldman Sachs Amanda Schneider.¬† "Hedge funds returned an average of 3.5% in 1Q 2013, lagging the S&amp;P 500 by 700 bp. Last year the average fund returned 8% vs. 16% for the S&amp;P 500." This is fodder for those that argue that investors are better off parking their wealth in low-cost index funds over hedge funds. Goldman Sachs ¬† A 'Bearish Shooting Star' Is About To Emerge (Miller Tabak) Miller Tabak's Jonathan Krinsky warns that a "bearish shooting star" will emerge on the S&amp;P 500 charts if the index closes at current levels.¬† "NYSE composite volume is running 9% above Tuesday‚Äôs pace. Breadth has moved from +1244 at 10:30 am, to negative 74 currently. Needless to say, that is quite a large reversal, especially after there were over 500 new 52 week highs today. Health Care is best +0.93%, while Utilities struggle down 0.46%. "With the pickup in volume, and the broad amount of new highs across individual names and sectors today, the close should be very important. Closing at current levels would leave many indices with bearish ‚Äúshooting star‚Äù candles on the daily charts.

Fox Business screencapBuzzfeed's Mariah Summers has obtained a copy of John Thomas Financial's "Golden Pitchbook" ‚Äî a compilation of cold calling scripts/scenarios for the firm's most senior brokers.¬† In case you're not already familiar, John Thomas is the brokerage firm founded and run by "Wall Street 2" actor Anastasios "Tommy" Belesis. The brokerage was recently the subject of a Bloomberg News report about how the "Red Bull-fed" brokers are forced to stand for 14 hours a day. Belesis, who played Shia LeBeouf's managing director in Oliver Stone's film, was also recently charged by the SEC and FINRA.¬† FINRA's complaint alleged that Belesis threatened to run over people with a car who disagreed with how he does business. The "Golden Pitchbook" Buzzfeed found is full of possible scenarios and responses for the brokers. ¬†For example, if a client said he wasn't liquid, a broker would tell them they could come up with the money or if a client requested more information about a stock the broker would say they already did all the research. ¬† Here are the possible responses for brokers mentioned in the book for when one of JFT's clients wants to speak to his wife before buying a stock. ¬† Buzzfeed/ScribdBuzzfeed/ScribdBuzzfeed/Scribd

With about half of the country still suffering from extreme drought, farmers and businesses in the Western United States are looking at another hot, dry summer.¬† And the country's water risk is a lot worse than most assessments suggest, according to a recent study from the Columbia University Water Center.¬† Taking into account past patterns of drought and water use, the Columbia study reveals that several major metro areas, including New York City, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, are at high risk for water scarcity, along with the Great Plains agricultural belt extending from North and South Dakota down to North Texas.¬† Columbia University Water Center Here's a list of the top 10 areas with the highest risk for water scarcity:¬† "All cities and all businesses require water, yet in many regions, they need more water than is actually available ‚Äî and that demand is growing," said Upmanu Lall, director, Columbia Water Center. "The new study reveals that certain areas face exposure to drought, which will magnify existing problems of water supply and demand."¬† The study notes that a 99% population increase since 1950 combined with a 127% increase in water use has further decreased water availability, making it increasingly difficult to replenish water supplies after a drought.¬† The report doesn't predict when or where the water scarcity will become an issue. In New York and Washington, D.C., for example, water is brought in from outside of the city from other sources, which are typically plentiful.¬† In other areas, however, the current drought ‚Äî the worst since the Great Depression ‚Äî is already bringing water availability issues to the fore. ¬† According to the most recent federal forecast, about 48% of the contiguous U.S. is now experiencing moderate to exceptional drought, down from a high of 60% at the beginning of the year. The drought is expected to intensify in the West this summer, and while conditions should "ease" in the Plains states, the drought is not expected to end anytime soon and temperatures are expected to be above-normal for most of the lower 48 this summer.¬† Summer 2013 National Drought Outlook "Even if you don't believe in climate change, the North American continent historically has had frequent and severe droughts," Lall said. "There are very significant droughts that have happened here historically ‚Äî they are not that unusual."¬† The New York Times highlighted the growing water worries this week, with a story examining the depleting resources of the High Plains Aquifer, which provides irrigation for agricultural centers in the Midwest.¬† The Times reports:¬† Two years of extreme drought, during which farmers relied almost completely on groundwater, have brought the seriousness of the problem home. In 2011 and 2012, the¬†Kansas Geological Survey reports, the average water level in the state‚Äôs portion of the aquifer dropped 4.25 feet ‚Äî nearly a third of the total decline since 1996. This map shows the decline in the aquifer:¬† ¬†USGS As the Atlantic Wire's Philip Bump points out, the High Plains Aquifer has been a "hydrological savings account" for farmers in the Great Plains. But as the aquifer's resources dwindle, farmers are being forced to subsist on water from rainfall, at the same time that rainstorms are becoming less and less frequent. ¬† The ramifications for agriculture and business are predictably devastating.¬† Bloomberg reports that an Ernst &amp; Young corporate sustainability study recently found that 76% of corporate representatives think water is the top resource at risk.¬† According to the federal forecast, national pasture and rangeland conditions are at record lows, and 39% of the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated poor or very poor, up from 25% last year.¬† Lall points out that the water scarcity could also pose huge problems for the burgeoning domestic energy industry. A recent Ceres research paper found that a lot of hydraulic fracturing‚Äî a process that uses tons of water ‚Äî is taking place in water-scarce regions, with nearly 47% of wells located in highly-stressed water basins, including 92% of wells in Colorado and 51% of wells in Texas.¬† The map below shows water competition in U.S. shale exploration:¬† Ceres According to Lall, there are two solutions to mitigating U.S. water risk. The first, he said, is raising awareness about the problem and managing water needs. The second, more problematic solution, is developing and improving the country's water storage capabilities ‚Äî which would require significant investment in water infrastructure.¬† "If you add up all the water infrastructure in the country, almost $1.5 trillion needs to be spent on water infrastructure in the next 20 years," Lall said. "We have made almost no investments in water infrastructure since the Reagan administration. Something needs to be done about it."¬†
Fisker AutomotiveA Chinese auto parts maker and a group led by former General Motors executive Bob Lutz have reportedly made a $20 million offer to buy Fisker, the electric car company that has collapsed in recent months. Reuters reported the bid, citing "people familiar with the matter." The Chinese parts supplier, Wanxiang, is the largest company of its kind in China. The group led by Lutz, VL Automotive, is a boutique car company. The deal would be done through a prepackaged bankruptcy. A separate team of investors may buy out the U.S. Department of Energy's outstanding loan to Fisker, which has not built a car since July, according to Reuters. Fisker, which once built some of the coolest electric cars around, laid off three-quarters of its workforce in April. China's Geely Automotive, once considered Fisker's best bet for a financial lifeline,¬†dropped out of talks¬†to buy the company in March, citing onerous conditions that come with paying back federal loan. The company still owes the Department of Energy around $171 million in outstanding loans, according to Reuters.
Google FinanceAfter wobbling in the green for most of the morning, stocks are now in the red. Markets have been digesting Fed's prepared remarks and the Q&amp;A from this morning's testimony to the Joint Economic Committee. Bernanke's key point: premature tightening of monetary stimulus risks slowing or ending the recovery. This caused stocks to spike, the dollar to sink and gold to surge.† At one point, the Dow was up by over 150 points. However, the market pared much of those gains after Bernanke said that the Fed could taper its bond purchases in the next few meetings if the economic data supported it. The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, which were released at 2:00 PM ET, also had a hawkish flavor to it. "FOMC minutes show a willingness to taper asset purchases this year. We expect the taper will begin in either late Q3 or early Q4," said Deutsche Bank's Joe Lavorgna.
BloombergLast summer, Citi's chief economist, Willem Buiter, introduced a bold call: he assigned a 90% probability that Greece would exit the euro on January 1, 2013. This assertion was made before European Central Bank President Mario Draghi introduced a new ECB bond-buying program, dubbed "OMT" (outright monetary transactions), which has more or less completely quelled the turmoil that the European sovereign debt crisis has inflicted upon markets over the past few years. Needless to say, Buiter's dramatic call didn't work out. By October, Buiter and his team revised the odds of a Greek exit to 60%, and even then, only by the end of 2013. However, they maintained that a Greek exit was still their base case, saying it would likely happen in 2014, after the German elections. In a note out today, the Citi economics team is once again walking back their views toward the likelihood of a Greek exit from the euro. Here's the key section: Grexit Postponed, Euro Area Economy Still Weak The euro area economy remains weak, and GDP has now fallen for six consecutive quarters. Growth prospects remain poor, and we expect that the euro area will continue to underperform versus official forecasts and the consensus in 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, we have become a bit less gloomy on euro area growth for next year, and we are raising our 2014 growth forecast from minus 0.3% last month to 0.0% this month (while pulling our 2013 forecast down from minus 0.6% to minus 0.7%). This upgrade reflects two main factors. First, with the drift to accepting deficit slippage amidst economic weakness and low government bond spreads, fiscal headwinds in the weak periphery economies should be less severe than seemed likely a few months ago. The IMF has scaled back its forecast for the average (unweighted) structural fiscal tightening in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland in 2013 to 1.2% of GDP from 1.8% of GDP in its late-2012 forecast. Second, we are no longer including Grexit at the start of 2014 in our base case. We still believe that there is a fairly high risk of Grexit in coming years, but no longer put it in our base case at any particular date. This partly reflects a lower risk of Grexit, but also a sense that, with creditor nations taking a more relaxed line on fiscal targets and Greece‚Äôs coalition government holding together, triggers for Grexit as early as 2014 have receded markedly. The chosen date was always somewhat arbitrary, but to construct a consistent forecast we pencilled in sizeable Grexit-related uncertainties and financial strains around that date, hitting the 2014 growth outlook. That intensified headwind is now absent in our forecast. Crisis over?
America's ultra-rich want to bring back the bison. A number of hotshot investors from Wall Street and Silicon Valley have given some $60 million trying to build their very own "American Serengeti" in Montana,¬†according to Bloomberg Pursuits. An organization called the American Prairie Reserve is behind the project, which has so far attracted billionaires such as candy heirs Forrest Mars Junior and his brother John, German retail baron Erivan Haub, and a slew of others. The group hopes to buy up some 3.5 million acres of land (that's bigger than Yellowstone National Park), and introduce 10,000 purebred bison, along with deer, antelope, coyotes, and prairie dogs. They aren't the only tycoons with a passion for the embattled species: media mogul Ted Turner, who is the second-largest landowner in the U.S., is raising some 50,000 head of bison out west and¬†has fought to keep several dozen bison¬†calves born at Yellowstone on his private ranch. Eventually, Prairie Reserve plans to open it to the public, much like a national park, and built a "safari camp" for visitors to the prairie, Bloomberg Pursuit's Seth Lubove reports. But one group is furious about the plan. Local cattle ranchers, who are being offered as much as $2,000 an acre by Prairie Reserve, say the reintroduction of bison would destroy their livelihood. ‚ÄúIn order to build their 3-to-4-million-acre vision, I can‚Äôt live here,‚Äù rancher Leo Barthelmess Jr. told Bloomberg. "This landscape was broken in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Ranchers and the Soil Conservation Service worked and brought this prairie back...It doesn‚Äôt need to be saved from ranchers; it was already saved by ranchers.‚Äù But with many of the ranchers "land rich and cash poor," the big money behind the project may prove too tempting to resist.

Earlier, stocks, gold, and bonds jumped as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered a prepared statement during a testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. However, it didn't take long for everything to head back down in the other direction when the question was put to Bernanke: could the Federal Reserve begin tapering back its bond purchases by Labor Day? Bernanke didn't rule it out as a possibility as long as there was enough improvement in the economic data to warrant such action. This isn't inconsistent with anything that the Fed has said before ‚Äì bond buying will scale back when the Fed thinks the economy can finally handle less monetary stimulus ‚Äì but markets took this as an opportunity to sell off. And gold keeps heading lower. It just edged down a bit more with the release of the minutes from the FOMC's April 30-May 1 monetary policy meeting. Now, the shiny yellow metal is trading 1.5% lower on the day, at levels around $1357. KITCO
The Office / NBCYou can't talk about it or mention it, but you can certainly think about it, and according to a new column by Liz Ryan in BusinessWeek, a lot of people do. "The Truth About Sex At Work..." Ms. Ryan begins, and then she explains that, in addition to being professionals, we are also people, and people have desires, and... Then Ms. Ryan quickly progresses to this startling anecdote: After I once spoke about this topic at the Bar Association in New York, a partner at a big law firm came up afterward to say that his firm had taken out the security cameras in its stairwells. ‚ÄúWe picked up so much sexual activity on the cameras, after midnight, that it was a liability to have the videotape in our possession,‚Äú he explained. Ms. Ryan fell in love with her future husband at work, and they have now been married 20 years and have five kids, so she has an interesting perspective on the subject. Ms. Ryan is not calling for a work-world in which employees can just leap into each other's arms in front of their colleagues--for obvious reasons, this would be uncomfortable and unconducive to a productive workplace. Ms. Ryan also does not think that bosses should be sleeping with their paramours if the paramours also happen to be direct reports. What Ms. Ryan wishes, which is presumably something that lots of human employees wish, is that we could just talk about it. Here's the sex-at-work policy that Ms. Ryan would like to see enacted: We hire vibrant and sparky people here at Acme Explosives, so it isn‚Äôt surprising that some of them might end up being attracted to one another. The one thing that doesn‚Äôt work is when two people who are involved in a romantic relationship also have a reporting relationship. To put it another way, you can‚Äôt date your boss or your boss‚Äôs boss. That could easily create an unfair relationship, so if you want to date your boss or your boss wants to date you, somebody has to change jobs, either inside the company or to another company. Apart from that, you can date whomever you like, but please keep the kissy-touchy part of the relationship out of the workplace, for everyone‚Äôs comfort. Physical displays of affection between colleagues (whether they are dating or not) are not comfortable for other people. If you want our help navigating a situation that has to do with dating or romantic attraction and your job, please talk with Carolyn in HR. She is an expert at that sort of thing. Sounds reasonable. And also seems to be the de facto policy that many companies adhere to. What do you think? Read Liz Ryan's column here &gt;

The main headline: many on the Committee said more progress is needed before tapering back any bond purchases under the Fed's quantitative easing program. The FOMC saw an economy expanding at a "moderate pace." However, recent data raised concern on the Committee that the recovery may be slowing.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period. By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to extend the reciprocal currency (swap) arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Banco de M√©xico for an additional year beginning in mid-December 2013; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada allows for cumulative drawings of up to $2 billion equivalent, and the arrangement with the Banco de M√©xico allows for cumulative drawings of up to $3¬†billion equivalent. The vote to renew the System's participation in these swap arrangements was taken at this meeting because a provision in the Framework Agreement requires each party to provide six months' prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.¬† Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information reviewed at the April 30-May 1 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first quarter. In March, the unemployment rate edged down further, although it continued to be elevated, and employment growth slowed. Consumer price inflation was relatively low, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. After faster gains in January and February, private nonfarm employment increased at a subdued rate in March, and government employment declined slightly. The unemployment rate was 7.6¬†percent in March, a little below its average in the fourth quarter of last year. The labor force participation rate also edged down to below its fourth-quarter average. The rate of long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined somewhat in March, but these measures remained well above their pre-recession levels. Indicators of near-term labor market conditions were consistent with projections of moderate increases in employment in the coming months: Measures of job openings generally moved up, but the rate of gross private-sector hiring and indicators of firms' hiring plans were subdued, on balance, and initial claims for unemployment insurance trended up a little over the intermeeting period.¬† Manufacturing production decreased slightly in March but expanded at a brisk rate in the first quarter as a whole, supported in part by a recovery in output following Hurricane Sandy, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization in March was somewhat higher than in the fourth quarter. The production of motor vehicles and parts rose solidly in March, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector declined. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the coming months would be a bit below that in March. Broad indicators of manufacturing production, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that pointed to small increases in factory output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) expanded at a solid pace in March and in the first quarter as a whole. Some factors that tend to influence household spending were generally positive in recent months. For example, real disposable income increased in February and March, supported in part by recent declines in retail gasoline prices that raised household purchasing power and offset to some extent the effects of this year's higher payroll and income taxes. In addition, household net worth likely rose in recent months as a result of higher equity values and home prices. In contrast, consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was roughly flat, on balance, in March and April and remained relatively downbeat. Conditions in the housing sector continued to improve, as real expenditures for residential investment expanded briskly in the first quarter, although from a low level. Total combined starts of new single-family homes and multifamily units increased in March to a level well above that at the beginning of the year. Home prices continued to rise through February, and sales of new homes rose in March, but sales of existing homes decreased a little. Growth in real business expenditures on equipment and software slowed in the first quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft continued to rise gradually in February and March, but new orders were slightly below the level of shipments, pointing to modest gains in shipments in the near term. Other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, also suggested that outlays for business equipment would rise at a subdued pace in the coming months. Real business spending for nonresidential construction declined a little in the first quarter. Real inventory investment increased in the first quarter, and business inventories in most industries appeared to be broadly aligned with sales in recent months. Real federal government purchases declined markedly in the first quarter, led by a significant decrease in defense spending, which may have partially reflected the anticipated effects of the federal spending sequestration. Real state and local government purchases also decreased somewhat in the first quarter, as state and local construction expenditures continued to decline. ¬† The advance release of first-quarter data for the national income and product accounts showed that real net exports of goods and services also subtracted moderately from real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as real imports outpaced real exports. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for PCE, edged down in March and rose just 1¬†percent from a year earlier. Consumer energy prices declined in March, and retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of April. Consumer food prices only edged up in March. Consumer prices excluding food and energy were flat in March, and their increase from 12 months earlier was similar to that for total consumer prices. Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were slightly lower in April, and longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were little changed and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for several years. Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages remained subdued. Increases in the employment cost index were modest over the year ending in the first quarter. Average hourly earnings for all employees were unchanged in March, and hourly earnings gains in the first quarter as a whole were muted. ¬†¬† Economic growth in foreign economies overall in the first quarter of 2013 showed only a small improvement from that registered in the second half of 2012. Real GDP growth picked up in the United Kingdom, and recent indicators suggested that the pace of contraction moderated in the euro area. In contrast, economic growth in China slowed abruptly after surging late last year. Foreign inflation appeared to increase a little in the first quarter, partly as a result of higher food prices in several emerging market economies, but remained quite moderate. Staff Review of the Financial SituationFinancial conditions improved a little, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Yields of longer-term Treasury securities and foreign benchmark sovereign bonds declined appreciably, reflecting the somewhat negative tone of U.S. and foreign economic data releases as well as policy actions by the Bank of Japan that were more accommodative than the markets had expected. Equity prices rose modestly, on net, supported in part by solid quarterly earnings reports. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes shifted down moderately over the intermeeting period. However, the Desk's survey of primary dealers, conducted prior to the April 30-May 1 meeting, indicated that the dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time for the initial increase in the target federal funds rate. The median dealer anticipated that the FOMC would maintain its current pace of asset purchases through December 2013 and saw the second quarter of 2014 as the most probable time for the end of asset purchases, implying a slight upward revision to the projected total size of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program. Over the intermeeting period, near-term measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities moved lower amid somewhat disappointing economic data and declines in energy and other commodity prices; forward measures of inflation compensation changed little at longer horizons. Yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) decreased about in line with those on nominal Treasury securities of comparable duration. Conditions in domestic dollar funding markets were generally little changed, and offshore dollar funding markets reacted only modestly to the elevated uncertainty surrounding the negotiations, early in the intermeeting period, to resolve the banking crisis in Cyprus.¬† Some indicators of the condition of domestic financial institutions weakened slightly. Share prices for the largest domestic banking organizations declined somewhat, on balance, and bank credit default swap spreads edged a bit higher, on average, across the larger firms in the sector. Broad equity price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting solid quarterly earnings reports, stable medium-term earnings expectations, and lower interest rates. Option-implied volatility for the S&amp;P 500 index over the near term remained in a range that was low by historical standards.¬† Yields on corporate bonds fell roughly in line with those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, generally leaving their spreads little changed. The rate of corporate bond issuance by nonfinancial firms remained robust in March and April. Consistent with recent trends, some companies reportedly retired a notable portion of their outstanding commercial paper and issued longer-term bonds in comparable amounts. Syndicated leveraged loans were issued at a record pace in the first quarter, supported by strong demand for this type of asset, particularly from nonbank institutions. Gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms was solid over the same period. Conditions in some segments of the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to improve in recent months. Outstanding CRE loans held by commercial banks edged up in the past two quarters following a prolonged period of decline, and commercial mortgage-backed security issuance was strong in the first quarter. According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) conducted in April, the fraction of banks that eased standards on CRE loans over the past three months increased to a relatively high level, while demand for these loans strengthened further. CRE prices continued to move up slowly, and price indexes for various market segments reached levels last seen in late 2008. Rates on conforming home mortgage loans declined over the intermeeting period, and the spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields remained well below its peak during the second half of 2012. The estimated pace of mortgage refinancing originations continued to be high, supported by historically low mortgage rates. However, purchase mortgage applications stayed at low levels. Overall delinquencies trended lower for both prime and subprime mortgages, primarily reflecting the very tight underwriting standards imposed over the past several years. Consumer credit continued to expand in January and February, mostly driven by sizable increases in nonrevolving credit. Growth was particularly strong in auto loans as well as in student loans extended through the Department of Education's Direct Loan Program. In contrast, total revolving credit was about flat amid continued tight underwriting standards and terms on credit card loans. Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities--in particular, those backed by subprime auto loans--remained robust in recent months. Total bank credit expanded moderately during the first quarter of 2013. Gains continued to be concentrated in commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans, which increased especially strongly at domestic banks. In the April SLOOS, relatively large net fractions of these banks reported having eased standards and reduced spreads on C&amp;I loans to firms of all sizes. M2 grew at a faster pace in March and April than earlier in the year, possibly boosted by the higher level of annual tax payments and refunds relative to recent years. Meanwhile, the monetary base expanded briskly over those two months, driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve's asset purchases. Early in the intermeeting period, prices of a range of risky assets abroad fell in reaction to reports of the "bail-in" of depositors at banks in Cyprus and the imposition of an extended bank holiday¬†in that country, but outside of Cyprus those movements generally proved temporary. Euro-area equity indexes, which fell as stresses in Cyprus intensified, ended the period up slightly. By contrast, stock prices in Japan rose sharply, as the Bank of Japan surprised investors with the scale of its new monetary policy program aimed at raising inflation to 2 percent. Yields on longer-term Japanese government bonds displayed considerable volatility in the days following the announcement, although they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Outside of Japan, foreign benchmark sovereign yields fell over the intermeeting period, with market commentary citing weak U.S. and foreign macroeconomic data releases, increased expectations for further monetary accommodation by some foreign central banks, and the announcement by the Bank of Japan. After appreciating, on balance, since early this year, the dollar depreciated against most currencies, although it continued to appreciate against the yen.¬†Emerging market stock prices changed little, on net, and emerging market equity mutual funds experienced modest outflows. Staff Economic OutlookIn the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April 30-May 1 FOMC meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was little revised from that prepared for the March meeting. With fiscal policy expected to be tighter this year than last year, the staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP would only somewhat exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013. The staff also continued to project that real GDP would accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually. The staff's forecast for inflation was also little revised from the projection prepared for the March FOMC meeting. With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, energy prices expected to continue to trend down, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would remain subdued through 2015. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years. However, the risks to this outlook were viewed as skewed to the downside, reflecting in part concerns about the situation in Europe. Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants generally indicated that they viewed the information received during the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace despite some softness in recent economic data. Conditions in the labor market showed some continued improvement, although the unemployment rate remained elevated. Spending by consumers continued to expand, supported by better credit conditions, rising equity and housing prices, and lower energy prices; and the housing sector improved further. However, growth in business investment spending slowed somewhat, and fiscal policy appeared to be exerting significant near-term restraint on the economy. Perhaps reflecting more subdued growth abroad, especially in Europe and China, net exports weakened in the first quarter. Participants generally saw the economic outlook as little changed since they met in March. However, economic data releases over the intermeeting period were mixed, raising some concern that the recovery might be slowing after a solid start earlier this year, thereby repeating the pattern observed in recent years. Various views on this prospect were offered, from those participants who put more emphasis on the underlying momentum of the economy, noting the strengthening in private domestic final demand, to those who stressed the growing fiscal restraint or the other headwinds still facing the economy. Participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, growth would proceed at a moderate pace over the medium run and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels consistent with the Committee's mandate. A number of participants noted that the balance of risks to growth remained to the downside, al-though a couple suggested that such risks had diminished appreciably since last fall. A few participants warned that, in light of ongoing fiscal restraint and a weak global outlook, economic data could remain soft for the next few months, regardless of the underlying strength of the economy.¬† Consumer spending was reported to be strong in a number of areas of the country and, more broadly, appeared to be supported by rising equity and house prices, improved household balance sheets, and easier credit conditions. However, concerns were expressed that this rate of growth in consumer expenditures might not be sustainable without the support of a notable pickup in business investment and hiring. Other factors that might affect spending also were mentioned. For example, the losses in income and wealth experienced during the crisis might lead households to be more cautious in their spending and to save at a higher rate; wealth gains in recent years appeared concentrated among higher-net-worth individuals, who may have a lower propensity to spend out of additional wealth; and retailers reported weakness in spending by lower-income households, who had been more affected by the increase in payroll taxes. Participants saw the housing market as having strengthened further during the intermeeting period and pointed variously to rising house prices, growth in home sales, a lower inventory of houses for sale, a reduction in the average time houses stayed on the market, and encouraging reports from homebuilders. More all-cash or investor purchases were being reported, and the pace of home purchases overall appeared to be constrained less by a lack of demand than by a lack of homes for sale, in part reflecting fewer newly foreclosed houses coming onto the market. The rate of new delinquencies on mortgages declined nearly to pre-crisis levels, and the pipeline of properties in the foreclosure process was being slowly worked down, in part through modifications and short sales. Over time, the supply of homes for sale was expected to increase as new construction picked up and sellers saw more attractive opportunities to put their houses on the market. The improvement in the housing sector was also seen as contributing to a pickup in activity in related industries.¬† With some exceptions, business contacts were reporting continued caution about expanding investment or payrolls. Reports included some weakening in manufacturing activity, due in part to reduced demand from abroad, and farm exports in one District were projected to be flat following strong growth in previous years. However, the CRE sector showed some signs of recovery, and survey results indicated that the terms of CRE lending were easing and loan demand increasing. The federal spending sequestration and recent tax increases were viewed as restraining aggregate demand. Participants differed somewhat in their assessments of the magnitude of these effects on the economy, with views ranging from an estimate of substantial fiscal drag to one of less restraint than previously expected. A few participants mentioned the sequestration's impact on hiring and spending by the defense industry or government contractors, but one participant noted that a decline in expected future tax liabilities of the private sector associated with lower federal spending might provide a partial offset to the economic effects of the budget cuts. Participants generally saw signs of improvement in labor market conditions despite the weaker-than-expected March payroll employment figure. Employment growth in earlier months had been solid, and more-recent improvements included the further decline in the unemployment rate in March and the gradual progress being made in some other labor market indicators. However, several participants cautioned that the drop in the unemployment rate in the latest month was also accompanied by another reduction in the labor force participation rate; the decline in labor force participation over recent quarters could indicate that the reduction in overall labor market slack had been substantially smaller than suggested by the change in the unemployment rate over that period. One participant commented that assessing the shortfall of employment from its maximum level required taking account of not only the gap between the unemployment rate and its corresponding natural rate, but also the gap between the labor force participation rate and its longer-term trend--a trend which was admittedly subject to considerable uncertainty. A few participants mentioned that job growth may have been restrained to an extent by businesses postponing hiring because of uncertainties over the implementation of health-care legislation or because they were unable to find certain types of skilled workers. Both headline and core PCE inflation in the first quarter came in below the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent, but these recent lower readings appeared to be due, in part, to temporary factors; other measures of inflation as well as inflation expectations had remained more stable. Accordingly, participants generally continued to expect that inflation would move closer to the 2¬†percent objective over the medium run. Nonetheless, a number of participants expressed concern that inflation was below the Committee's target and stressed that future price developments bore careful watching. Most of the recent reports from business contacts revealed little upward pressure on prices or wages. A couple of participants expressed the view that an additional monetary policy response might be warranted should inflation fall further. It was also pointed out that, even absent further disinflation, continued low inflation might pose a threat to the economic recovery by, for example, raising debt burdens. One participant focused instead on the upside risks to inflation over the longer term resulting from highly accommodative monetary policy.¬† Financial conditions appeared to have eased further over the intermeeting period: Longer-term interest rates declined significantly, banks loosened their C&amp;I lending terms and standards on balance, and competition to make commercial and auto loans was strong. Businesses were reportedly still borrowing to refinance, but they had begun to take out more new loans as well. While the Committee's accommodative policy continued to provide support to financial conditions, events abroad also influenced U.S. markets over the intermeeting period. In particular, the Bank of Japan announced a new monetary policy program that was considerably more expansionary than markets had expected. Financial conditions in Europe improved somewhat over the period, but some participants still saw the situation in Europe as posing downside risks to U.S. growth. At this meeting, a few participants expressed concern that conditions in certain U.S. financial markets were becoming too buoyant, pointing to the elevated issuance of bonds by lower-credit-quality firms or of bonds with fewer restrictions on collateral and payment terms (so-called covenant-lite bonds). One participant cautioned that the emergence of financial imbalances could prove difficult for regulators to identify and address, and that it would be appropriate to adjust monetary policy to help guard against risks to financial stability. ¬† In discussing the effects of the Committee's asset purchases, several participants pointed to the improvement in interest-sensitive sectors, such as consumer durables and housing, over the recent period as evidence that the purchases were having positive results for the economy. The effects on a range of asset prices of the Bank of Japan's recent announcement were cited as added evidence that large-scale asset purchases were effective in easing financial conditions and thereby helping stimulate economic activity. In evaluating the prospects for benefits from asset purchases, however, one participant viewed uncertainty about U.S. fiscal and regulatory policies as interfering with the transmission of monetary policy and as preventing asset purchases from having a meaningful effect on the real economy.¬† Participants also touched on the conditions under which it might be appropriate to change the pace of asset purchases. Most observed that the outlook for the labor market had shown progress since the program was started in September, but many of these participants indicated that continued progress, more confidence in the outlook, or diminished downside risks would be required before slowing the pace of purchases would become appropriate. A number of participants expressed willingness to adjust the flow of purchases downward as early as the June meeting if the economic information received by that time showed evidence of sufficiently strong and sustained growth; however, views differed about what evidence would be necessary and the likelihood of that outcome. One participant preferred to begin decreasing the rate of purchases immediately, while another participant preferred to add more monetary accommodation at the current meeting and mentioned that the Committee had several other tools it could potentially use to do so. Most participants emphasized that it was important for the Committee to be prepared to adjust the pace of its purchases up or down as needed to align the degree of policy accommodation with changes in the outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as the extent of progress toward the Committee's economic objectives. Regarding the composition of purchases, one participant expressed the view that, in light of the substantial improvement in the housing market and to avoid further credit allocation across sectors of the economy, the Committee should start to shift any asset purchases away from MBS and toward Treasury securities. Committee Policy ActionCommittee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions had shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth. The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judged consistent with its dual mandate. Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and persisting slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. The Committee agreed to continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and purchases of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, as well as to maintain the Committee's reinvestment policies. The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. One member dissented from the Committee's policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations. A few members expressed concerns that investor expectations of the cumulative size of the asset purchase program appeared to have increased somewhat since it was launched last September despite a notable decline in the unemployment rate and other improvements in the labor market since then. In contrast, a few other members focused on evidence that market expectations about the total size of the program had changed little, on net, since the program was launched or had responded appropriately to incoming information. Members generally agreed on the need for the Committee to communicate clearly that the pace and ultimate size of its asset purchases would depend on the Committee's continued assessment of the outlook for the labor market and inflation in addition to its judgments regarding the efficacy and costs of additional purchases and the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To highlight its willingness to adjust the flow of purchases in light of incoming information, the Committee included language in the statement to be released following the meeting that said the Committee was prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: "Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from ¬†0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability." The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency ¬†¬†mortgage-backed securities in agency ¬†mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2¬†percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent." Voting for this action:¬†Ben Bernanke, William C. Dudley, James Bullard, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Jerome H. Powell, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Eric Rosengren, Jeremy C. Stein, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against this action:¬†Esther L. George. Ms. George dissented because she continued to view monetary policy as overly accommodative and therefore as posing risks to the long-term sustainable growth of the economy. She expressed concern that the stance of policy might be fostering imbalances and excessive risk-taking in some financial markets and institutions, and she cited the potential for the Committee's ongoing asset purchases to complicate the future conduct of policy, raise uncertainty, and affect future inflation expectations. Accordingly, Ms. George preferred to signal a near-term tapering of asset purchases, which would begin to move policy toward a more appropriate stance. Review of Exit Strategy PrinciplesAfter the policy vote, participants began a review of the exit strategy principles that were published in the minutes of the Committee's June 2011 meeting. Those principles, which the Committee issued to clarify how it intended to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when doing so eventually became appropriate, included broad principles along with some details about the timing and sequence of specific steps the Committee expected to take. The participants' discussion touched on various aspects of the exit strategy principles and policy normalization more generally, including the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio in the longer run, the use of a range of reserve-draining tools, the approach to sales of securities, the eventual framework for policy implementation, and the relationship between the principles and the economic thresholds in the Committee's forward guidance on the federal funds rate. The broad principles adopted almost two years ago appeared generally still valid, but developments since then--including the change in the size and composition of SOMA asset holdings--suggested a need for greater flexibility regarding the details of implementing policy normalization, particularly because those details would appropriately depend at least in part upon future economic and financial developments. Also, because normalization still appeared to be well in the future, the Committee might wish to wait and acquire additional experience to inform its plans. In particular, the process of normalizing policy could yield information about the most effective framework for implementing monetary policy in the longer run, and thus about the appropriate size of the SOMA portfolio and level of reserve balances. In addition, several participants raised the possibility that the federal funds rate might not, in the future, be the best indicator of the general level of short-term interest rates, and supported further staff study of potential alternative approaches to implementing monetary policy in the longer term and of possible new tools to improve control over short-term interest rates.¬† Views differed regarding whether the best course at this point would be to simply acknowledge that certain components of the June 2011 principles had been overtaken by events or rather to formally revise the principles. Acknowledging that the principles need to be updated would help avoid possible confusion regarding the Committee's intentions; waiting to update the principles would allow the Committee to obtain additional information before revising them. It was also mentioned that the public's understanding of the likely exit process might not be improved if the Committee issued only a set of broad principles without providing detailed information on the steps anticipated for normalization. However, issuing revised principles relatively soon could give the public additional confidence that the Committee had the tools and a plan for eventually normalizing the conduct of policy. Moreover, one participant stressed that the Committee's ability to provide forward guidance about the normalization process was a key monetary policy tool, and revised principles would permit use of that tool to help adjust the stance of policy. Participants emphasized that their review of the June 2011 exit strategy principles did not suggest any change in their views about the economic conditions that would eventually warrant beginning the process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chairman directed the staff to undertake additional preparatory work on this issue for Committee consideration in the future. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, June 18-19, 2013. The meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m. on May 1, 2013.

Miller Tabak's chief technical market analyst Jonathan Krinsky alerts clients about a "bearish shooting star" that will emerge on the S&amp;P 500 charts today if the index closes around current levels. Here's Krinsky: NYSE composite volume is running 9% above Tuesdayís pace. Breadth has moved from +1244 at†10:30 am, to negative 74 currently. Needless to say, that is quite a large reversal, especially after there were over 500 new 52 week highs today. Health Care is best +0.93%, while Utilities struggle down 0.46%. With the pickup in volume, and the broad amount of new highs across individual names and sectors today, the close should be very important. Closing at current levels would leave many indices with†bearish ìshooting starî†candles on the daily charts. Of course, we have seen over and over in this rally where one dayís bearish action has meant nothing more than that, just one day. The chart below shows the bearish shooting star. The way these candlestick charts work, for those who aren't familiar: the bottom and top of the box formed by each candlestick represent the day's opening and closing prices, respectively, while the lines extending from the box represent the intraday range. So, then, a bearish shooting star, according to StockCharts.com, is "a single day pattern that can appear in an uptrend. It opens higher, trades much higher, then closes near its open. It looks just like the Inverted Hammer except that it is bearish." FINVIZ.comClick to enlarge
It's official! Former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner has announced his candidacy for mayor of New York. Mr. Weiner is nationally famous for accidentally sexting a picture of his, well, weiner, to the entire world a couple of years ago (it was supposed to be a direct message to a young fan). Weiner first claimed he'd been hacked. Then he lied. Then, finally, in a teary press conference, he resigned his seat and ducked out of sight for a while. And now he's back! In a new campaign video, Mr. Weiner acknowledges that he has made mistakes. But he has learned from them. And his lovely wife still loves him. And it's time to get back in the game... Naturally, the press would like to commemorate Mr. Weiner's new candidacy with a few candid photos of him. So they're staking out his house on lower Park Avenue. At last count, there were three TV trucks and at least a dozen photographers camped on the corner. (See below.)¬†So when Candidate Weiner finally emerges, you'll know... (For what it's worth, our view is that the media will have fun with this shlong thing for a few more days, and then everyone will get bored of it. Politicians have made a lot bigger mistakes in office and lived to get re-elected. And so can Anthony Weiner.) Business Insider Business Insider Business Insider¬†

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonShamed US financier Bernie Madoff, serving a 150-year prison sentence, is back in the spotlight as the star of an exhibit in a US museum dedicated to gangsters and serial killers. A baseball bat engraved with the former mogul's name, a letter in which he seeks forgiveness from his son Andrew and even keys to his old New York office are on display at Washington's National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment. In total, some 15 items that once belonged to the famous fraudster or are in some way linked to him, are on view. The 75-year-old, who once chaired the Nasdaq stock exchange, was found guilty of being behind a massive Ponzi scheme. He took in billions from thousands of clients over decades, building a reputation as a shrewd investment manager by paying out fake "profits" to some investors by plundering the new cash from others. But his pyramid fraud collapsed in 2008, wiping out numerous family fortunes. He was arrested in December that year, and pleaded guilty in 2009. "The general public thinks of crime as a violent crime, but there are many that are not violent, we make sure that in our museum we focus on everything," Janine Vaccarello, the museum's chief operating officer, told AFP. She said the items were given to the museum by Madoff's son, liquidator Irving Picard or even victims. The Madoff display case is placed next to a wall dedicated to Frank Abagnale, a con artist made famous by the film "Catch Me If You Can" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Vaccarello said Madoff is "by far the largest financial criminal, with thousands of victims and in many countries. He is considered the worst of the worst." "If it looks too good to be true, it can't be true and don't invest your money," summed up Joe Persichini, the retired assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office, at the exhibit's opening.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As federal prosecutors circle Steven A. Cohen's $15 billion hedge fund in a long-running insider trading probe, one financial adviser in Texas is so devoted to the billionaire investor that he may give him more money. "I'm thinking about putting more money with him," said Ed Butowsky, managing director at Chapwood Capital Investment Management, who manages $1 billion in client money. The Dallas-based adviser did not say how much his wealthy clients have invested with Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, but said the figure tallies into the tens of millions. "Stevie Cohen is the Michael Jordan of hedge fund managers," Butowsky said, comparing the billionaire trader's success in the markets to the feats of the legendary professional basketball star. "I'd be a fool to take out money." With the quarterly June 3 deadline for outside investors in SAC Capital to decide whether to withdraw money from the hedge fund, it is unclear how many of Cohen's other investors share Butowsky's sentiment. People familiar with the fund, said Cohen is bracing for additional redemption requests, especially after the revelation that federal prosecutors recently sought to compel him to testify before a grand jury in connection with the insider trading investigation of SAC Capital. Outside investors like Butowsky and the much bigger Blackstone Group are weighing whether to bolt from SAC Capital or stick with a firm that has delivered a 25 percent annual return over its 21-year history. Earlier this year, outside investors, who account for roughly 40 percent of the money managed by SAC Capital, notified Cohen they intend to withdraw $1.7 billion by year's end. A spokesman for Cohen, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has invested roughly $8 billion of his own money in SAC Capital, declined to comment. In recent weeks speculation has grown in the hedge fund world that if outside investors pull out too much money in the second quarter, Cohen may opt to convert his hedge fund into a so-called family office that only manages his own $8 billion investment. With the redemption deadline just two weeks away, the main concern for Cohen, is not what relatively small investors like Butowsky's firm think about the investigation fallout, but what Blackstone Group will do. The private equity and investment firm is Cohen's biggest outside investor and at the end of 2012 had about $550 million in client money with SAC Capital. Blackstone, which invests roughly $46 billion with some of the world's most successful hedge funds, is often seen as a bellwether for other investors. So far, the firm has not indicated what it will do, but a number of clients have told the firm they would like to redeem from SAC Capital, said a person familiar with the situation. Some of the money invested by Blackstone in SAC Capital is pooled in investment funds that allocate money to dozens of hedge funds. Other money managed by Blackstone is in so-called separate accounts the firm oversees for pensions, foundations and wealthy individuals. For instance, CalPERS, the California public pension fund with roughly $256 billion in assets, committed $500 million to a separately managed Blackstone account in May of last year. When asked whether the account had any exposure to SAC Capital, CalPERS spokesman Joe DeAnda said he could not provide information on portfolio holdings. A person familiar with the hedge fund industry said most of the requests Blackstone has received from investors seeking to redeem from SAC Capital are clients with separately managed accounts like CalPERS. Dale Connors, managing director at Watershed Investment Consultants, which advises on the $37 million that the Arapahoe County Retirement Plan has put with one of Blackstone's hedge fund of funds said he is monitoring the situation. The administrator for the Teamsters Pension Trust Fund of Philadelphia and Vicinity, William Einhorn, declined to comment. And James DelSignore, auditor for the Massachusetts city of Worcester, said his fund is pulling some $6 million, or half of its investment in Blackstone. The withdrawal was not due to the SAC matter but because pension funds in Massachusetts, including the state's $53 billion fund, are trying to save on fees. SAC, which charges some of the highest fees in the industry, has delivered returns of only 6 percent this year while the Standard &amp; Poor's Index has climbed 17 percent. One reason why investors might choose to stay with SAC Capital despite the scandal is that Cohen has taken steps to reduce the risk of loss if the federal government were to force him to shut the fund. Cohen has told investors he will pay any penalties and fines imposed on the firm.
We recently told you why we're long-term bullish on solar: there's a Moore's Law-esque effect in installed capacity, and there are huge investment opportunities.† But there's also been a lot of short-term euphoria, and†this chart from PowerClerk tells part of the reason why: the cost of panels themselves have fallen precipitously in the past few years. PowerClerkReports Unfortunately, it's not going to last. For years now, a feedback loop has been running in the solar market: demand has spiked in Europe, thanks to huge incentives for residents to switch. That, in turn, created an enormous glut of solar panel manufacturing in the Middle Kingdom.† MJ Shiao of GTM Research told us that trend is going to slow ó and possibly cause prices to go back up ó as manufacturers consolidate:† We're starting to see uncompetitive manufacturers bow out, and also more importantly see the Chinese government take an active role in consolidating the Chinese manufacturing market ó calling on manufacturers to stop increasing their productive capacity to alleviate pricing pains. So in the near term there's a lot of uncertainty, and in times of uncertainty you start to see pricing stabilize. We actually have seen pricing for panels go up. But longer term, prices will still come down, he says, thanks to ever-advancing technology that will allow panels to keep more heat.
Japan reported April trade figures earlier today. Given the decline in the yen and the positive contribution of exports to Q1 GDP, it is a closely watched report. However, there are two profound misunderstandings that distort how the media and some other observers comprehend the data.¬† First, the decline in the yen does not automatically translate into lower prices for foreign purchasers of Japanese goods. Second, Japan is not nearly as reliant on exports as many suggest. It services foreign demand primarily, though not exclusively of course, on building and selling locally. These foreign sales still bolster Japanese corporate earnings. There have been a number of reports that have cited Japan's dependency on exports and even the Financial Times recently noted one of the similarities between Japan and Switzerland was the heavy reliance on exports.¬† Despite the numerous repetitions, this is simply not factually true.¬†¬† The most recent comparable data from the World Bank is for 2011.¬† Japan exported 15% of its GDP and the US 14%. ¬† Switzerland exported 51% of GDP and Germany 50%.¬† China exported 31% of GDP in 2011.¬† This is not a new development and has persisted for some time.¬† Consider that in 2000, Japan exported 11% of GDP.¬† The same as the US.¬† Switzerland exported 45% of GDP and Germany 33%.¬† China exported 23% of its GDP in 2000.¬†¬† The Ministry of Finance data shows that some time in the late 1990s,¬† the sales by foreign owned subsidiaries of Japanese companies surpassed exports.¬† Consider that Toyota sold about 2 mln vehicles in North America last year and a little more than 70% were made there.¬† This compares with a 55% local production of the 2.21 mln vehicles sold in 2008.¬† Nissan aims to produce 85% of the vehicles it sells in North America by 2015 from 69% now.¬†¬† Consider Panasonic.¬† It has 189 production facilities abroad compared with 117 plants five years ago.¬† The yen has declined by 21% against the dollar since the election was called the middle of last November.¬† It was clear from the start that Abe was going to lead the LDP to victory.¬†¬†¬† This does mean that the price of Japanese goods have fallen.¬† The price of money adjusts considerably faster than the price of good, producing what economists call the J-curve.¬†¬†  A weaker yen does not automatically translate into higher exports.¬† Japan's exports to the US have risen 14.8% from a year ago.¬† However, exports to China, where the yen has declined nearly 24% since mid-Nov '12 are up a mere 0.3%. ¬† Japan's exports to the euro area are off 3.5% from a year ago, even though the yen has declined 23%.¬† Note too that even for exports into the US, many costs are incurred locally.¬† These costs include transportation, marketing and storage.¬† These costs could amount to as much as the cost of the good itself.¬† A weaker yen still helps Japanese businesses, but not necessarily through increased sales volumes.¬† Rather, the shift in foreign exchange prices means that the foreign currency revenue earned through foreign sales translates into more yen.¬† Some estimates suggest that currency translation could be worth $2000 a vehicle.¬† This is a key factor boosting earnings and earnings expectations for Japanese companies.¬†¬† Observers often see what they want.¬† In a survey of major new wires and papers, with few exceptions, the reporters cited unadjusted trade figures that showed that April deficit (~JPY880 bln) was much larger than the March deficit (~JPY362.5 bln).¬† Abenomics is not working, they want to conclude.¬† One reporter even argued that an even weaker yen is needed, though an increasing number of Japanese businesses are content with it to stay around current levels.¬† As Japan has moved production facilities offshore, imports cost more in a depreciating yen environment.¬† It is customary to look at the trade figures on a seasonally adjusted basis when comparing data to the previous month.¬† The seasonally adjusted trade deficit stood near JPY764.5 bln in April, down from a revised (lower) March deficit of almost JPY919.9 bln, which is the smallest in three months. ¬† On a year-over-year basis, Japan's exports have risen 3.8% and are back to pre-Lehman levels.¬† Imports are up 9.4% from a year ago, reflecting not only the dependency on foreign fuel but also food, clothing and other supplies.¬†  Read more posts on Marc to Market ¬ª
May 21, 2013 Hong Kong [Editor‚Äôs note: Sovereign Man‚Äôs Chief Investment Strategist Tim Staermose is filling in today while Simon is en route to the United States.] Myanmar is among the hottest ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù investment markets today. The country is going from an authoritarian regime to democracy, from a conflict situation to a situation of relative peace, and, most importantly, from a closed economy of state-owned companies, to an open, free market economy. Such positive change all at once in one country is unprecedented. Fund managers are falling over themselves to invest there. At The Myanmar Investment Summit in Hong Kong last week, I met some of them. The problem is, at this early stage there is no easy way to invest. There is a stock market. But, it has only 2 listed companies: Myanmar Citizens Bank, and Forest Products Joint Venture Corp (FPJVC). But they don‚Äôt actively trade. There are also two public companies controlled by Myanmar‚Äôs leading tycoon Serge Pun. First Myanmar Investment Co., Ltd. trades ‚Äúover the counter‚Äù in Myanmar among well-connected locals. But there is no stock market listing. The other is Yoma Strategic, the group‚Äôs Singapore-listed arm. But it‚Äôs already surged to a nosebleed valuation. With so few investable vehicles, that leaves the private equity market. There are already plenty of people setting up such funds to capitalize on the wave of money sitting on the sidelines ready to wash into the Myanmar economy. These funds will all need local businesses and projects to invest in. And that‚Äôs where the real opportunity lies. For the right person, getting to work on the ground sourcing deals for all these ‚Äúfrontier investment funds‚Äù to invest in could be enormously lucrative. I‚Äôm talking about generational wealth potential. Come up with a good idea, or find a great investment on the ground in Myanmar, and there is practically an unlimited amount of capital available for the project. And there‚Äôs huge potential in the country. There‚Äôs a young population roughly 50 million people that‚Äôs simultaneously one of the cheapest work forces in Asia as well as one of the fastest growing consumer markets. Manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, construction and building materials, real estate development, transportation, logistics‚Ä¶ you name it, the country needs it ALL. However, it‚Äôs not going to be a walk in the park. Myanmar still sorely lacks basic infrastructure. Blackouts are commonplace. Just 25% of the population has access to electricity. There‚Äôs no functioning banking or financial system. Outstanding credit to GDP is just 5%. And, only 6% of the population has telephones. So for now, it‚Äôs largely been a case of waiting for the infrastructure to improve‚Ä¶ which is starting to happen. Several independent power producers are getting ready to turn on the lights. The government will be announcing the winners of tenders for two new telecoms licenses in the near future. Credit cards are beginning to be accepted, and the banking system is being modernized. And with the country‚Äôs profile on the international stage constantly improving, the time is ripe. Read more posts on Sovereign Man ¬ª
YouTubeIt's no secret that in the U.K., people are sick of bankers. While 'banker bashing' calmed in the U.S. in the years after the financial crisis, scandals like Libor manipulation and Standard Chartered's money laundering have seriously enraged British politicians. At least they're starting to get creative with it. Bloomberg reports that Ed Miliband, the head of the U.K.'s Labor Party was making a speech at Google Conference today, and he used that opportunity to say that the Royal Bank of Scotland was just like Montgomery Burns, the lovable(ish) villain on The Simpson's. Here's the quote from Bloomberg: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not such a good guy, he leaves radioactive nuggets lying around,‚Äù Miliband said of Burns. ‚ÄúOf course, he is a cartoon character, but I could have substituted him with RBS or some of the other big banks before the financial crash.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe illustrates my case today because there is a choice to make,‚Äù Miliband said. ‚ÄúA choice between an ‚Äòirresponsible capitalism‚Äô which sees huge gaps between the richest and the poorest, power concentrated in a few hands, and people are just in it for the fast buck whatever the consequences.‚Äù Exxxxceeellllenttt reference, Miliband.
Comedy CentralFaux conservative comedian Stephen Colbert slammed a bill introduced in early May by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) that would end most functions of the U.S. Census Bureau, including employment, GDP, and housing data. Duncan's bill, which has 10 Republican co-sponsors, would enable the Census Bureau to only conduct a population survey. "You hear that, Census Bureau? Population count only! You have no right to my personal information," Colbert said. "That belongs to Facebook." Colbert mocked concerns that Census data could be used to create a national gun registry or, for "something even more sinister, tracking the corn harvest." "It's like that horror movie ‚Äî 'Aggregate Yield of the Children of the Corn,'" Colbert said. As for concerns about Duncan's bill eliminating employment data, Colbert said we already have a reliable measure ‚Äî the Nielsen ratings for "Maury." Watch the clip below:

AP Photo/Ric FrancisEarlier today we saw that existing home sales climbed 0.6% to a rate of 4.97 million units in April. This missed expectations but was the highest pace since November 2009. But the best news in the report was that distressed sales, which includes foreclosures and short sales, only accounted for 18% of sales. This was down from 21% in March, and 28% a year ago. Foreclosures accounted for 11% of sales and sold for an average discount of 16% below market value. Short sales accounted for 7% and sold at a 14% discount.¬† "That‚Äôs the lowest reading since the NAR started collecting these data in 2008," wrote Capital Economics' Paul Diggle. "Just 15 months ago, distressed sales accounted for 35% of all existing home sales.¬† Put another way, distressed sales are down 29% y/y while non-distressed sales are up 25%. The market is starting to take on a semblance of normality." He also pointed out that inventory while low, is rising as rising home prices are boosting confidence. "The increase in the seasonally-adjusted months' supply of unsold stock in April, from 4.9 to 5, was slight and not a threat to continued house price gains." Here's a look at existing homes for sale since 1983: Capital Economics
C-SPANFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke¬†testified this morning before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. The main takeaway from his¬†opening statement¬†was that premature tightening of monetary stimulus risks slowing or ending the recovery. Bernanke was grilled by Congress over when the Fed will begin tapering off of bond purchases, a prospect markets appear to be taking seriously in the past few weeks as government bonds have sold off and yields have risen. However, Bernanke is just repeating what he has already said in the past ‚Äì it's dependent on the economic data, and the Fed could decide to decrease or increase bond buying based on how the data unfold. Nonetheless, markets used this as an opportunity to give up earlier gains. When asked whether concerns over financial stability stemming from the Fed's involvement in the bond market have increased recently, Bernanke responded that "they have increased a bit." When asked about the Fed's effect on markets, Bernanke told the Committee that stock and bond prices do not appear inconsistent with the underlying fundamentals, and that asset price issues are "still relatively modest."
Wikimedia CommonsWall Street is a stressful place, and everyone has their own coping mechanism. To get a sense of how bankers are dealing with the long nights, the deadlines etc. eFinancialCareers conducted a survey with 14 activities (and an "other") that respondents might be using to loosen up. Most people responded with fairly mundane things like, exercising, watching TV and spending time with family. Zzzzzzzzzz But of the 86 people that used the "other" column, 1/4 of them said they drink or do drugs to relieve stress. From eFinancialCareers: Breaking down the numbers, an interesting pattern appears. Roughly 17% of respondents with fewer than four years of experience on the Street said they drink or do drugs to handle stress. The number balloons to 30% for financial services employees with more than five years of experience. Seniority ‚Äì and responsibility ‚Äì take their toll... ‚ÄúThe money isn‚Äôt always enough to drown out the stress,‚Äù said one VP at a U.S. investment bank who admitted their habits have increased. ‚ÄúOn those days, you get creative.‚Äù ‚ÄúTaking pills all day to make you faster means you have to drink at night to slow down,‚Äù said another veteran investment banker. Adderall, a prescription amphetamine used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is his drug of choice. The message here could either be 'get out while your young' or 'it takes time to figure out how to enjoy yourself...' It depends on your social values, really. That said: The survey also showed that the 2nd most popular coping mechanism was prayer, and the older a banker gets, the more likely it is that they'll use it. So maybe Wall Streeters have a 'Come to Jesus Moment' later in life? Leave your thoughts on this in the comments.

Courtesy of A. Lange & S√∂hne You may think that for a watch to cost more than a million dollars, it should have some historical significance or be dripping in diamonds. But watches at the highest end of the price spectrum don't necessarily have either. To find out why some watches command crazy prices, we spoke to a representative from¬†A. Lange &amp; S√∂hne, an ultra-high-end watch manufacturer based in Germany. The company recently debuted its Grand Complication, an incredibly sophisticated timepiece with a price tag of¬†‚Ç¨1.92 million ($2.49 million at today's conversion rates) and 876 individual components. The design is so complicated that the company only plans to produce six pieces. "There will only be one made for each year throughout the next six years," A. Lange &amp; S√∂hne's Alexandra Haxton told us. "Only one watchmaker was able to work on each piece." Two factors go into the price, he said: Materials and workmanship. The materials that go into the watch are all of the highest quality: It is made with an enamel dial, solid pink gold case, gold hands, a blued-steel second hand, and a hand-stitched leather crocodile strap. Even the interior mechanisms have been polished black, and everything is hand-finished and hand-engraved. Courtesy of A. Lange & S√∂hneBut the real value comes from production. It takes a full year for the watchmaker to complete each piece¬†‚Äî a process that actually happens twice. "Our brand does 'double assembly,' which means that we put the watch together to perfection," Haxton said. "They take it apart and then reassemble it again just to make sure everything is in working order and perfect." It took product developers seven years to design the Grand Complication and conceive of a number of elaborate functions.¬† One of the most complicated is the "sonnerie," where the watch strikes a low-pitched gong every hour and quarter hour. With two settings called the "grand strike" and "small strike," it's perhaps the most complex function for a watch ever, Haxton said. Courtesy of A. Lange & S√∂hneHere's a glimpse of how complicated it looks on the inside.In addition to the gong strikes, the Grand Complication has a split-second chronograph with flying seconds (a mechanism that acts as a stop watch), and is accurate to one-fifth of a second. It also comes with a perpetual calendar, which will correctly display the date and time until the year 2100 without adjustment, as well a gorgeous moon phase display. In short, the watch is a work of art, both inside and out. Yet even with all of its incredible functions, the watch isn't showy in the way other watches of this caliber tend to be ‚Äî perfect for the unassuming multi-billionaire. There are already rumors that A. Lange &amp; S√∂hne has promised three of the watches to a businessman from Asia, and may have potentially sold all six even before the 2014 release date of the first watch. But don't worry, chances are an even more complicated watch is already being dreamt up. Courtesy of A. Lange & S√∂hne
Mondayís FT included an article titled, ìWall of money eases Eurozone funding.î The print version of the same story yesterday was titled, "Eurozone makes hay while bond market shines.î It notes: ìEncouraged by low market borrowing costs and strong investor demand, finance ministries are further ahead in funding programmes than at this stage in at least the past three years. France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands have raised more than half the yearís expected total, according to estimates by Barclays." Thatís even though the region is in the worst recession since the monetary union started in 1999. Investors are clearly reaching for yield all around the world, including in the peripheral countries of the euro zone. The FT reports: ìWhen Spain last week issued 10-year bonds, demand was three times greater than the Ä7bn raised. Italy raised Ä6bn from 30-year bonds, the first with such a long maturity since 2009. Earlier this month, Portugal issued Ä3bn of new 10-year bonds, its first since the country requested an international bailout programme two years ago.î Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Group Hug.

Flickr / mugleyWhat housing is and is not Housing, in a personal investment sense, is a confusing combination of necessity, consumption, and investment.† Separating and naming these functions can clarify for you exactly what youíre looking for in a house. Your house is your roof and shelter from the earthly elements first, as well as the place where you lay your head at night, and where you store some physical possessions. The portion of payments you make for a roof and shelter rank in priority just below payments you make to acquire water and food on a regular ñ ideally daily ñ basis. In that sense your house is a necessity. To the extent your payments for a roof and shelter provides a personal feeling of comfort, luxury, prestige, identity, and aesthetic personality, then part of your house payments go toward consumption.† You want these things, but you donít need these things in a fundamental survival-type way.[1]† In the meantime, you can have all of these necessity and consumption functions from housing without ëowningí the roof, without ëowningí and shelter.† What I mean is you can rent and fully satisfy the first two uses of housing. Owning a home is not a requirement of happiness or middle-class achievement.† It should not be a substitute for the ìAmerican Dream,î or fulfilling your wildest childhood fantasies of belonging to some social group. If you do choose the path of home ownership, your house may also serve as an investment.† What does the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex have to do with this? If housing is partly an investment, then know that the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex is seeking to mold your thoughts. The nexus of the real estate and lending businesses ñ a powerful branch of the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex ñ would have you conflate the necessity, consumption, and investment functions into fuzzy thinking. Iím not saying housing is not a great investment ñ of course it is.† Iím just advocating for a clear-headedness about what weíre doing when you choose ownership over rental.† A clear-headedness not overly determined by powerful forces shaping your thoughts. If all goes well for you, and housing inflation continues at a regular clip throughout the period of your home ownership, that fuzzy thinking will work out just fine for you.† But I want to take a moment to ponder what youíre really doing when you launch into the investment side of housing. Housing as an investment The good news First, thereís no other investment vehicle which has done so much to foster middle class savings and wealth accumulation as home ownership. With 4 to 1 leverage,[2] housing inflation, affordable and forced monthly payments, income tax breaks for mortgage interest, and generous tax exemptions for capital gains ñ I mean, this is one big, fat, middle-class birthday present for people who invested in housing over a long-term period of time, say, any time in the last 100 years. To repeat: Nothing (nothing!) combines so many advantageous factors for middle class wealth accumulation. The bad news On the other hand, housing as an investment periodically punishes the individual, a municipality, or an entire country for over-exposure to housing and its parallel ill, over-indedebtedness.† Just ask your foreclosed ex-neighbor, the City of Detroit, or, for example, the entire Spanish nation. So, yeah, there are risks.† I plan to review some of the risks, and opportunities, in the next post. See subsequent post ìOn Housing Part II ñ Risks and Opportunitiesî [1] When the vampire apocalypse happens, for example, you will settle for housing that fulfills a necessity, rather than insist on consumption.† And that necessity is keeping those scary scary blood-suckers outside of your four walls and roof.† Heavy duty reinforced steel and a panic room is my advice there. † [2] Assuming a 20% down-payment, 80% mortgage at inception, you are getting in financial terms 4 times the amount of debt ëleveringí your down-payment.† Hence my financial lingo ì4 to 1 leverage.î† Nothing else broadly available in the ordinary retail investment world comes close to that kind of financial gearing.
BloombergBloomberg prides itself on being a completely data driven enterprise, and people good money for that data. Sometimes, though, it's nice to give something out for free. Last time Bloomberg gave us a freebie it was an easy-to-navigate data visualization of monitoring the wealth of the 100 richest people in the world in real time. This time, they've designed a free visualization that has something for everyone (i.e. the people that don't stalk billionaires). It's called Bloomberg's Best And Worst and puts a ton of Bloomberg's quantitative driven lists in a free, clean, simple visualization online for the world to use. So now you can find out what the fattest country in the world is. Or the lowest paying, most dangerous job. Or the biggest CEO underachiever. It's all in one place.
Guest of a GuestDay &amp; Night Hamptons ‚Äî Montauk's ultimate table-dancing "brunch" party ‚Äî is coming back this Memorial Day. And in true Hamptons style, Derek and Daniel Koch, the brothers behind the party, are hiring a skydiver to deliver Dom Perignon ros√© to tables via parachute. Seriously. The skydiver will drop from 13,500 feet to your table at the Gurney's Inn on Montauk's shore front with a chilled bottle of champagne. That's way better than a sparkler (though they'll probably have those, too). Day &amp; Night will only be in the Hamptons Memorial Day weekend, July 4th, August 3rd, and Labor Day this year, but it sounds like they're going to make each weekend as memorable as possible. Our friends at Guest of a Guest shared some pictures from past Day &amp; Night parties so you can get an idea of what you're in for.
Medill DC / FlickrBen Bernanke is testifying in front of Congress today about the state of the economy. His full opening statement is here. Warning: It's very dry. He recapitulates the state of the economy, and then says that fiscal austerity was a drag, and that easing is still helpful. It's very dry stuff, but then again, this is a speech on the state of the economy, rather than a speech delivered to fellow economists about monetary policy. That being said, it's a gigantic waste of time for him to deliver this speech. Traders only care about the headlines, and there's no reason why the speech couldn't be delivered electronically to the members early, so that they could read it through and then jump to the Q&amp;A. This should be how all testimony goes. Deliver the speech electronically when things start. Let people read for a couple of minutes. And then jump right into the good action. No more opening statements.
REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueExisting home sales rose 0.6% to a rate of 4.97 million units in April. This is the highest pace since November 2009. This was slightly below expectations for a 1.4% month-over-month (MoM) rise to a rate of 4.99 million units. March's numbers were revised higher to show a 0.2% fall to 4.94 million units. What's more distressed sales only accounted for 18% of sales, down from 21% in March, and 28% a year ago. A regional breakdown shows that existing home sales rose the most in the South, up 2.0%. In the Midwest they fell 3.4%, in the Northeast they were up 1.6%, and in the West they were up 1.7%.¬† Housing inventory increased 11.9% to 2.16 million which represents a 5.2 month supply at current sales pace, up from 4.7 months supply in March. The national median existing home price climbed 11% on the year to $192,800. This increased for the 14th straight month. First time buyers accounted for a smaller share of sales at 29% in April, down from 30% the previous month, and 35% a year ago. All cash sales however accounted for a larger part of existing home sales. "The robust housing market recovery is occurring in spite of tight access to credit and limited inventory.¬† Without these frictions, existing-home sales easily would be well above the 5-million unit pace," said Lawrence Yun NAR chief economist in a press release.¬†  "Buyer traffic is 31 percent stronger than a year ago, but sales are running only about 10 percent higher.¬† It‚Äôs become quite clear that the only way to tame price growth to a manageable, healthy pace is higher levels of new home construction." Existing home sales account for a larger share of the market than new homes, and have outpaced new home sales. And with housing supply staying tight, a rise in existing sales should support home prices.
Getty Images / Mike StobeA week after his plan to revitalize the New York City taxi system was blocked, Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly accosted an NYC taxi boss in a private club and told him he would "destroy your f--k-ng industry." According to a new report in the New York Post, Bloomberg was at Madison Square Gardenís private 1879 Club for a Knicks playoff game when he was approached by Taxi Club Management CEO Gene Friedman. ìI saw Bloomberg and his security there in the club, so I went over and said, ëTell me what is going on with the Taxi of Tomorrow?íî Freidman told the Post. ìHe turns to me, and said, ëCome January 1st, when I am out of office, I am going to destroy your f---ing industry.í" If the account of the story is true (the Post claims to have another witness to the incident), it would seem the Mayor is angry over the failure of his "Taxi of Tomorrow" plan, which was blocked by a State Supreme Court judge last week. Bloomberg's plan ó the first major redesign of the NYC taxi system since the Checker cab, the New York Times reports ó would have seen NYC's taxis replaced with Nissan NV200s featuring transparent roof panels and ìlower-annoyanceî horns. The plan was blocked as it violated a New York City provision that requires a hybrid option. Friedman was one of many in the taxi industry who fought the plan. According to a profile from 2010, Friedman owns roughly 700 taxi medallions ó over 5 percent of NYC's total and worth around $542.5 million at the time.
"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment." A lot of people think the above quote comes from Charles Darwin, it's been sourced as coming out of his Origin of Species†but it's not actually in there. No, this quote was a summation of Darwin's work from a management professor at LSU in the early 1960's and then at some point it started being attributed to Darwin himself. But, for investors, the point remains. Change - or rather the willingness to change - is how you survive in investing. It's how you get better and how you don't make "The Big Mistake." It's not an accident that the greatest pure money manager of all time, Peter Lynch, was nicknamed The Chameleon. He earned the Chameleon moniker because he perceived†the changing environments he found himself in and adapted his style accordingly. He was less concerned with being right in academic debates or fighting over "what should happen" and more concerned with making money. FYI, Lynch compounded at an average annual return of 29% and beat the S&amp;P in 11 out of 13 years. He took the Fidelity Magellan Fund from $20 million in 1977 to more than $14 billion when he retired in 1990 - a 2700% gain from start to finish. He didn't even get the benefit of the next decade's go-go bull market to pad that record even further. Lynch remains untouched by anyone - whether they managed money before his career, during it or in the 25 years since. No one even comes close. What made him special? He made changes in a diverse variety of market environments without obsessing over one metric or another like a dying man clutching a religious totem to his chest. Lynch had six basic "stories" or types of stocks he liked to play and he leaned toward whichever ones were offering the best opportunities at a given time. He didn't walk around wearing a sign on his chest that said "Value Investor" or "Momentum Trader" or " Growth At a Reasonable Price Guy" or "Turnaround Player" and he†certainly†didn't care to be put into someone else's style box. Lynch knew that no approach worked best all the time. How many guys admit that out loud today in 2013? How many managers have the guts to tell a reporter or an anchorman "To be†honest, our area of expertise is not working in this environment, we're biding our time."†You shall hear that approximately never. Not many people can do that. It's hard. But I find it essential. I've already tried this the other way - the "stick to your guns" approach - and you can't imagine the war stories I've accumulated. The good news is that I don't have much of an ego left anymore... This is why it's so hard for blowhards to make money - they invest so much emotionally and propound their predictions with such force that they can't change their minds. They get entrenched because pride doesn't let them admit a mistake and there is too much public scrutiny. They become attached to the hip with a trade or a thesis, there is no escape other than to stick it out. Show me a PhD in love with his own theories and I'll show you someone who's about to blow up when the environment changes. Show me someone so confident in their system that they actually blame the market when it goes against them and I'll show you a madman with no understanding of complex adaptive systems. Show me someone who's already pounded their fist on the table for a certain outcome too many times to go back on it and I'll show you a tragic Homeric hero going down with his ship. Most of us are lucky - our careers don't depend on us having one opinion and maintaining it forever, regardless of new or disproven evidence, in the public eye. Most of us are allowed to say "here's what I think, but I could be wrong." Most of us get to admit small defeats and lapses in judgement. Most of us get to make small adjustments as things change without the stigma of highly public, failed predictions. We should be thankful to be free. And pity those who aren't so flexible, those who've dug themselves in. That's gotta suck...
A quick scoreboard check in the battle of billionaire hedge fund titans Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn over nutrition supplement seller Herbalife... From New York Post's¬†Michelle Celarier:¬† Ackman, who once had a paper profit of $480 million, is now down $10 million, according to calculations by The Post. Icahn, on the other hand, is up $228 million, calculations show. Ackman, who runs $12 billion¬†Pershing Square¬†Capital,¬†publicly said back in December¬†that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife with a price target of $0. ¬†He believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" and the FTC will be induced to investigate. ¬† Just a few weeks later, Ackman's long-time rival Icahn then snapped up a huge long position in Herbalife.¬† During an¬†epic brawl on CNBC between the two hedge fund titans, Icahn said, "I will tell you one day I think HLF will be the mother of all short squeezes." ¬† "If Ackman gets squeezed I'm not going to feel sorry..."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify the Joint Economic Committee of Congress at 10:00 AM ET today. And that will be followed by the release of the minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee. The entire investing world will be listening for clues on how and when the Fed plans to scale back its aggressive monetary policy. Art Cashin, UBS's man on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, has a preview of the Fed's appearances in this morning's Cashin's Comments: Bernanke ñ He will have to reassure that tapering is a discussion point but not an imminent strategy.† It would be very helpful (but doubtful) if he discussed option alternatives as near term supply of Treasuries and MBS decreases.† May be pushed a bit on goals and targets (unemployment, inflation, etc.). FOMC Minutes ñ May be a bit stale since jobs/claims shifts happened after the meeting. Consensus ñ Everybody and their respective siblings will be parsing every word from Mr. B.† Markets at strong premiums to moving averages but bulls still have momentum.† Be wary of rumors and stay very nimble. Basically, if Bernanke and the Fed stray from expectations, we could see some volatility in the markets. We'll be following Bernanke live at BusinessInsider.com.
The analysts at Goldman Sachs have just published their latest Hedge Fund Trend Monitor report, which tracks the equity investments of the world's hedge funds. One thing is clear: hedge funds are struggling to keep up with the market. "The typical hedge fund generated a YTD return of 5% through May 10, compared with 15% gains for both the S&amp;P 500 and the average large-cap core mutual fund," wrote Goldman Sachs Amanda Schneider.¬† "Hedge funds returned an average of 3.5% in 1Q 2013, lagging the S&amp;P 500 by 700 bp. Last year the average fund returned 8% vs. 16% for the S&amp;P 500." We recognize that not all hedge funds are out their to beat these benchmarks.¬† Furthermore, five months is certainly too short a period of time to judge performance. Nevertheless, this only supports the argument that most investors are much better off sitting in a boring, low-cost index fund. Goldman Sachs

REUTERS/Gary CameronGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidAt 10 AM EDT today, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify on the outlook of the U.S. economy before a Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Along with the subsequent release of the minutes from the FOMC's April 30-May 1 monetary policy meeting, due out at 2 PM, the Bernanke testimony is the main event on the calendar for markets this week. Because the stock market rally that began in November has yet to see any sort of meaningful downward correction, it has lent to the sense that the market just keeps going up, undeterred by weak economic data and the like. As such, the stock market will likely be a topic of interest for the JEC, and it may wish to put the question to Bernanke: are stocks in a bubble? In a preview of the testimony, Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson identifies two things the stock market will want to hear from Bernanke, and how the Fed chairman may respond to a grilling on stocks: There are two things the equity market would appreciate hearing from Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday. First, while progress is progress, it remains painfully slow. Such recognition will create the feeling amongst investors that quantitative easing is here for longer. Bond yields would decline in response while stocks would rally and the dollar would fall on the notion that it is surrendering its future yield advantage. Second, for it to build on already heady gains ñ the market closed 1,000 points off its March 2009 lows on Monday - the stock market needs a green light from Mr. Bernanke. Any reference to future bubbles building in ìcertainî asset classes or financial markets will be cause for a sell off in stocks. However, the Fed has developed ëasset patrol committeesí in the aftermath of the financial crisis whose role it is to monitor developments in financial markets and send up distress flares when unusual correlations begin. Thus far they have only spotted minor solar flares in some asset markets, but nothing to worry about. If Mr. Bernanke is grilled on the topic of the advancing stock market, we expect he will explain it in terms of a revaluation of earnings potential as a consequence of several years of financial repression rather than blaming it on ëirrational exuberanceí. He has said it before and we expect him to say it again, the stock market is hardly overvalued despite its recent rise. As we noted last week in a note, several Fed speakers have revisited the difficulty in pushing the flow of credit to would-be-homeowners ñ those with less than stellar credit. It does not make sense for Mr. Bernanke to upset the applecart despite the fact that equity traders seem to have adopted another mantra in May as they party like its 1999. In short, anything but optimism from Bernanke on stocks would probably come as a surprise.
Jewel Samad, AFPFor years Anita Zhang's neighbors joked that if a tornado ever bore down on her Chinese restaurant, folks could take refuge in its roomy walk-in freezer. On Monday, Zhang got the chance to test their idea -- and to live to tell the tale -- when one of the most powerful and destructive twisters to hit the United States in recent years ripped through this Oklahoma City suburb. "I'm so lucky," she said, over and over, as she told her story to AFP through an interpreter Tuesday in the driveway of her home in another section of Moore that escaped the tornado's raw fury. A native of Guangdong, the southern Chinese province that's no stranger to merciless typhoons, 57-year-old Zhang emigrated to the United States 10 years ago with other members of her family. She opened the Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant on Southwest 19th Street seven years ago in a commercial strip mall that catered to Moore's many handsome middle-class residential developments. It had a good reputation for such dishes as spicy fried General Tso chicken. "Great food at a great price," wrote one Google reviewer. "Very nice family-owned restaurant. The food is excellent. Service is quick." Jewel Samad, AFPPlease click for more pictures.Monday's tornado -- which police say killed at least 24 people with its 200 mile (320 kilometer) per hour winds cutting a 17 mile (27 kilometer) swath through Moore -- was quick, too. She was watching live storm coverage on local TV in the restaurant with her brother Michael Zhang, 50, when suddenly the power went off, the neighborhood disaster sirens wailed and the dark funnel of fury drew near. Into the freezer the siblings went -- with a blanket, thoughtfully -- to sit out the twister as it passed literally on top of them, pulverizing everything in its path. "I thought it was an earthquake," recalled the Cantonese-speaking Zhang, whose Mandarin Chinese name is Zhang Jianci. "I felt the building was shaking and moving. There were loud noises and banging and wind blowing... I thought only the glass door of the restaurant would be broken, but when we crawled out, everything was gone." Initially, the Zhangs struggled to open the freezer door against the debris. Michael was first to wiggle out; Anita was too scared to follow, until her brother announced that nearby buildings were on fire. Once out of the freezer, Anita Zhang heard people shouting: "Anyone there?" Later, she learned from her daughter that it was the neighbors, coming to check on their safety. Zhang's misfortune was for the business her immigrant family had toiled so hard to build to be literally on the wrong side of Southwest 19th Street, which turned out to be the southern edge of the tornado's scalpel-like track. On the north side of the street, besides the restaurant, the tornado smashed the entire Camden Village strip mall, including a liquor store that Tuesday reeked of broken bottles of booze, as well as a Walgreen's drug store. On the opposite side, however, a rival CVS pharmacy got off unscathed -- so much so that it re-opened for business. An adjacent low-rise apartment complex likewise sustained no serious damage. "We stood in the windows and watched it (the tornado) coming in," recounted Karen Smith, who works at the apartment complex. She and daughter Elizabeth then rode out the storm under a staircase, snuggling up with their dachshund Lucy. Police denied access to non-residents Tuesday to the worst-hit residential streets in Moore, but the startling scale of the destruction was all too visible from the sidelines. Zhang's family returned to the restaurant Tuesday to recover whatever they could salvage -- sacks of white rice, cans of vegetables, a barrel of MSG -- for safekeeping in the two-car garage back at home. Longer term, Zhang would like the Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant to reopen. It was insured, she said, although 24 hours after disaster struck, the family is still coming to grips with everything that's happened so suddenly. For now, she's more than content that her two granddaughters are unhurt. Their mother, who is Zhang's daughter, took them out of school before the tornado got too close and drove off with them to safety. "They are back now," she said with a sigh of relief. "They are alive." Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
Riley KaminerAlmost a quarter of teenagers in the US now hold a Twitter account, significantly more than the 16 per cent figure for the wider population - according to a new Pew Research Centre report. It found that 24 per cent of teens are now signed up, a substantial jump on the 16 per cent who did so in 2011 highlighting the growing diversity of social media habits. This growth wasnít sufficient to usurp Facebook as the dominant platform however which boasts an adoption rate of 94 per cent. Also, whilst 81 per cent say Facebook soaks up the majority of their time spent on social media just 7 per cent said the same thing for Twitter. This lead may not be quite so inassailable as the raw figures imply however with many teens professing more excitement for services such as Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr ñ where they are less likely to encounter the prying eyes of family members. Report author Mary Madden said: ìAdults were the first to colonise Twitter. However, teens are now migrating to Twitter in growing numbers, often as a supplement to their Facebook use.î
Brennan Linsley / APFamilies returned to a blasted moonscape that had been an American suburb after a monstrous tornado tore through the outskirts of Oklahoma City, killing at least 24 people. Passengers flying into Oklahoma City could see the track left by nature's fury as it played out Monday: the spot where the tornado touched down, then chewed through the suburb of Moore like a giant lawnmower for 45 terrifying minutes. Nine children were among the dead and entire neighborhoods vanished, with often the foundations being the only thing left of what used to be houses and cars tossed like toys and heaped in big piles. "It's unreal. It's so visceral," said 32-year-old accountant Roger Graham as he combed through the ruins of the three-bedroom home he shared with his wife Kalissa, a school teacher, recovering what he could. Kelly Pirtle of the US weather agency's Severe Storms Laboratory in nearby Norman, told AFP the tornado was the strongest possible category, EF5, packing winds of more than 200 miles per hour (321 kilometers per hour). Oklahoma City police chief Bill Citty told a news conference that 20 people had been killed in Moore and four more elsewhere in the city. "There could be obviously others in the coming days. The search is still going on, heavily in Moore because they have such a large area to cover," he said, adding: "So we have a 24 right now. There could be more. APClick for more pictures >"All of the people that have been reported missing -- initially last night, about 48 -- all of those have been actually found except for I think a few left in Moore that they are working on to try to locate that have not." At least 101 people have been pulled alive from under debris, said Terri Watkins of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, and officials said more than 200 people have been injured. Some of the children killed were buried when the two-mile wide funnel of wind demolished an elementary school. US President Barack Obama declared a "major disaster" as crews combed the wreckage of the shattered community, where even residents with long memories of past storms were shocked by the devastation. In televised remarks from the White House, Obama made special mention of the young victims as he mourned those lost and promised to provide survivors with the help they need to find their footing. "The people of Moore should know that their country will remain on the ground there for them, beside them as long as it takes for their homes and schools to rebuild," Obama said. "There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms and bedrooms and classrooms and in time we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community," he added. The killer system -- packing powerful winds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) -- flattened block after block of homes, set off fires, downing power lines and tossed cars. Stunned weather forecasters described an epic two-mile (three-kilometer) wide mid-afternoon storm, as news helicopter footage showed a dark twister plowing through densely packed suburbs. "To me, this is bigger than anything I've ever seen. It's absolutely huge. It's horrific," Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin said. "It looked like somebody just set off something that just destroyed structures, not blocks, but miles of areas, and major buildings from hospitals to schools to banks to shopping centers, movie theaters." Local television footage on Monday showed children as young as nine being pulled out of the Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, a residential community of 55,000 just south of Oklahoma's state capital. "I had to hold onto the wall to keep myself safe," one little girl said. The Moore Medical Center was evacuated after it sustained damage, and state authorities called out the National Guard to help rescue efforts as Obama ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts. Rescue operations already hindered by the mounds of debris and fallen power lines could be further disrupted by more foul weather. "I had no idea it was coming," said a horse stable worker, who told how he survived the "unbearably loud" twister by taking cover in one of the stalls. Monday's tornado followed roughly the same track as a May 1999 twister that killed 44 people, injured hundreds more and destroyed thousands of homes. Tornadoes frequently stalk Oklahoma's wide open plains but Monday's twister struck a populated urban area. Because of the hard ground, few homes here are built with basements or storm shelters in which residents can take cover. Oklahoma City lies inside the so-called "Tornado Alley" stretching from South Dakota to central Texas, an area particularly vulnerable to tornadoes, but Moore's residents were shocked at the devastation. Some 29,000 people remained without power early Tuesday, according to OG&amp;E, the local utility. The National Weather Service forecast more tornadoes later Tuesday, with parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas most likely to be affected. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
Wikimedia CommonsThe talk today is about Japan. That's in part because the stock market just hit a brand new 5.5 year high. It also comes amid increasing evidence that domestic demand is picking up, thanks to a new slew of stimulus measures, which combined are known as "Abenomics." If the domestic economy comes roaring back to life, it will help settle one of the most important questions in economics: Can monetary stimulus be effective, when interest rates are at zero? Economists talk about the challenges of the "Zero Lower Bound" all the time. In an interview with Business Insider last December, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius states: ...one of the big lessons that weíve taken away from the past few years is that the zero lower bound on nominal short-term rates is a really big deal because it does get quite a bit more difficult for central banks to provide stimulus once youíve hit that zero bound. If what Japan is doing (aggressive inflation targeting + quantitative easing) works to stimulate the real economy, it will be a strong point in favor of the idea that the Zero Lower Bound is not an iron barrier that makes monetary policy less effective, but rather a point where Central Bankers must merely show more creativity and determination to keep easing.
Wikimedia CommonsMartin Fackler at The New York Times has a dispatch from Japan regarding the real-world impact of "Abenomics" the government's three-pronged economic jumpstart scheme. Abenomics involves ultra-aggressive monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, and also structural reforms. Since it became clear that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would take office last autumn, the stock market has been on a tear, and the yen has been sliding, but of course the real question is whether the measures will produce a real-world reaction among domestic consumers and businesses. There are some signs that it's working. Even some of Japanís wary consumers are beginning to indulge. At the plush Takashimaya department store in Tokyoís financial district, a clerk reported that $20,000 watches had become hot sellers. And a cut-rate sushi chain, which flourished in difficult times, just started a line of upscale restaurants for customers newly able to afford ìpetite extravagances.î ... ìYoung people even in their 40s donít remember Japanís good times,î said Hiroshi Sato, a 64-year-old executive treating himself to one of Takashimayaís fancy watches. Choosing one from a black velvet tray, he explained his purchase as a bet on Mr. Abeís success after two decades of his predecessorsí failures. It's important to recognize that domestic demand appears to be springing to life. Because the yen has been dropping, there's a widespread belief that Abenomics is about weakening the currency to make exporters more competitive. And that may be phone side-phenomenon. But as Lars Christensen has recently pointed out, the theory behind aggressive monetary policy is not about boosting exports, but about inducing domestic activity by raising inflation and demand expectations. So people buying watches and eating upscale sushi is exactly what the government has in mind.
JonesTradingThis is a new term we haven't seen before. Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading says that we're now seeing the "Iraq" of monetary policy, meaning the Fed has entered into an extraordinary situation, from which it has no good plan to self-extricate. The Iraq of Monetary Policy.†††† Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement?† This is one of the key questions of the Powell Doctrine that leaders are supposed to ask before entering a combat engagement.† Today, NY Fed President and FOMC Vice Chair Bill Dudley gave a speech noting that the Fedís exit strategy is ìstale.î† One might go a step further and say the Fed has painted itself into a corner.† Dudley is a member of the BYD (Bernanke, Yellen, Dudley), the unofficial ruling triumvirate of the FOMC.† Dudley was speaking about monetary policy at the zero bound at the Japan Society.† The key highlight of Dudley's† speech† today for the market was that ìBecause the outlook is uncertain, I cannot be sure which wayóup or downóthe next change will be.î† Someone, please let us know when the outlook is certain. In other "exit" news, POLITICO reported yesterday that Ben Bernanke held a private meeting with some GOP Congressmen, including Darrell Issa, who demanded to learn more about the size of the Fed's bond portfolio. Bernanke testifies in front of Congress today, so hopefully these topics will come up.
Fung Global InstituteRichard Koo is the brilliant Nomura economist who developed the framework of a "balance sheet recession" to characterize periods where private enterprises seek to reduce debt, rendering monetary policy largely useless, and thus requiring aggressive fiscal stimulus. As such, Koo has not hopped on the Abenomics bandwagon, which places a heavy emphasis on the Bank of Japan engaging in stimulus. The BOJ's stimulus has so far caused the stock market to surge, the yen to fall, and even long-term Japanese bond yields have had some big up moves, and this is what concerns Koo. In his latest note, he warns that the Bank of Japan needs get out in front of inflation worries, and state that although it's targeting 2% inflation, it won't tolerate hotter inflation than that. What can the BOJ do? To begin with, the Bank and the government could make it clear that they are targeting a 2% rate of inflation but at the same time, they will not under any condition tolerate a significant overshooting of that rate. The Bank of Japan has built up an enviable record as an inflation fighter over the past 30 years and in the process won the public‚Äôs trust. Accordingly, I think such a declaration would still carry a lot of weight. By stating that they will not accept an overshooting of the target, the Bank of Japan and the government could reassure the markets that there will be no plunge in the yen and no bouts of uncontrollable inflation. I think the risk of a sharp rise in long-term rates will also be significantly reduced if the BOJ can successfully communicate these points to the market. The yen‚Äôs rapid decline‚Äîwhich contributes directly to inflation‚Äîand stocks‚Äô sharp rise in recent months has raised the possibility of such an overshooting. I think it would be appropriate for the BOJ to consider adjusting the pace of easing going forward in response to these unexpectedly quick improvements. I think it is also important for the Abe administration to dispel the perception that its scenario for economic recovery is heavily dependent on BOJ policy by placing greater emphasis on the second and third components of Abenomics. If the government is seen as relying excessively on monetary policy at a time when everyone recognizes that the second and third components are essential for a longer-term recovery, the whole enterprise could be stopped in its tracks once monetary policy is perceived as having run up against the wall because of a rise in long-term rates, etc. One of the beautiful things about Abenomics is the perception of recklessness. People can't believe Japan's chutzpah, as Japan has now essentially committed to being irresponsible, which is very difficult for central banks to do. Coming out now, and promising that inflation would be hard-capped at 2% would reintroduce that perception fo responsibility, and the fears that the old BOJ had come back would materialize.
Not much more to say than what's right here. Dismal. #UK April retail sales inc. fuel -1.3% M/M, biggest drop since April 2012; +0.5% Y/Y. Retail sales ex fuel -1.4% M/M, +0.2% Y/Y. This does not support that view.
This guest post previously appeared at SoberLook. On¬†its risk appetite index, Credit Suisse views the index value of 5 as "euphoria". And we are headed there, as markets embrace risk. SoberLook This is not surprising given where credit markets are trading. As an example, the Merrill European High Yield Index average yield is now below 4.5% (4.46% to be precise). Keep in mind this is sub-investment grade debt mostly from European issuers. The yield on these bonds is now¬†less than half what it was just a year ago. FRED Not much else to say here other than enjoy it while it lasts.
With a modestly positive economic environment, high profit margins, improving private investment, high budget deficits and a belief that stocks are cheap‚Ä¶.the bulls get increasingly optimistic. ¬†This is from Goldman‚Äôs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin and his team: ‚ÄúWe are raising our S&amp;P 500 dividend estimates and index return forecasts for 2013 through 2015. We expect S&amp;P 500 index will rise by 5% from the current level to 1750 by year-end 2013, advance by 9% to 1900 in 2014, and climb by 10% to 2100 in 2015. We expect a 3-month return of 2% to 1700 and a 10% return during next 12 months to 1825. Our previous 2013-2015 year-end targets were 1625, 1775, and 1900, respectively. 1. We expect S&amp;P 500 dividends will rise by roughly 30% between 2013 and 2015. We forecast dividend growth of nearly 11% in both 2013 and 2014 and about 9% in 2015. Our earnings forecasts remain unchanged but we have boosted our payout ratio assumptions. While 1Q year/year earnings growth of 6% was in line with expectations, dividends surged by 12% led by surprisingly large hikes from Financials and Consumer Discretionary firms. Our dividend forecasts are now in line with the dividend swap market for 2013 and 2014 but slightly above the implied levels for 2015 through 2022. Together our dividend and price target forecasts imply an S&amp;P 500 annualized dividend yield of 2.2% from 2013 to 2015. 2. Our US Economists forecast above-trend growth in 2014 for the first time in six years. In advanced economies, the final year of economic stagnation before GDP growth exceeded trend has been associated with P/E multiple expansions averaging 15%. Our year-end 2013 forward P/E of 15x would be 14% above last year‚Äôs 13.2x. The S&amp;P 500 currently trades at 14.6x bottom-up consensus and 15.0x our top-down NTM EPS estimates. 3. The macro investment environment supports an above-average S&amp;P 500 valuation. Our standard valuation approaches point to a P/E multiple of 14x forward earnings. However, our revised forecast estimates an S&amp;P 500 P/E multiple of 15x-16x during the next three years that is above the long-term average but in line with the post-1990 experience. The S&amp;P 500 forward P/E multiple has averaged 12.9x since 1973 but 15.3x since 1990.‚Äù
It's just crazy. Japan is setting records day in and day out. Here's the Nikkei last night. Nikkei.com This is of course, a brand new 5.5-year high, as the market has surged some 80% since late last year, all thanks to "Abenomics," the country's aggressive stimulus campaign. Meanwhile, U.S. futures are up modestly, and Japan is mixed. The big news of the day will be Bernanke testifying before Congress.
