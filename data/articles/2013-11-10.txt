Honestly, we're surprised this hasn't come up before... Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, RBS, Barclays and more banks are discussing changes to their policy allowing traders across Wall Street to speak to each other in Bloomberg chat rooms, the WSJ reports. Credit Suisse and JPM are considering blocking access to them entirely. This would be a big change. Wall Street 101 â€” traders love and live for their chat rooms. However, transcripts from said chat rooms have figured heavily into a wide range of probes into Wall Street malfeasance. Most recently, they regulators have used themÂ to investigate allegations of rate rigging and market manipulation in theÂ U.S. and U.K.Â (think: LIBOR and currency markets).Â  A few days ago, in London, JPM CEO Jamie Dimon told a room full of employees not to "exaggerate.. ruminate... or bullshit," in communications of any kind. You better believe this is what he was talking about. The speech was harsh, but this new news makes Dimon's wag of the finger sound like a walk in the park.
The US Senate Banking Committee will hold hearings onÂ Thursday, November 14, on the nomination of Janet Yellen for Federal Reserve chair. There will be the usual softball questions, for example, "Do you think high unemployment is a problem in the United States and if so what do you intend to do about it?" (which allows a senator to express his concern over unemployment and for the nominee to agree that it's a problem). Or the always popular question, "What is the basis under which you would continue to hold interest rates at their current low level?" â€“ as if she would answer anything other than, "Any future policy decision is of course data-dependent" or some variation on that response. Boring. There have been a flurry of new research papers this week by Federal Reserve economists, IMF economists, and even Paul Krugman, all suggesting various policy responses going forward, but none suggesting a return to normal any time soon. I would be far more interested in getting a response from Yellen to some of that research, but even the questions raised in those papers don't get to the real heart of the matter. So today, let's pretend we are prepping our favorite Banking Committee senator (members here)Â for his or her few questions. What would you like to know? In this week's letter I offer a few questions of my own. First a brief caveat. Each of the questions below deserves multiple pages of background. I get that. There is only so much I can write in one letter. Further, some of the questions are intended to provide an insight into Yellenâ€™s thinking and what research she considers to be relevant. Those are more the "inquiring minds wants to know" type of question. And since Senator Rand Paul is not on the committee, I have omitted some of the questions he might ask. Not that they aren't interesting and shouldn't be asked, but there is only so much space. What Questions Would You Ask Janet Yellen? Secondly, I know for a fact that a few Senators on this committee and even more of their staff members read my letter from time to time. I would expect that to be the case this week. I also know that I have some of the smartest and most thoughtful readers of any writer I know. If you want to address a committee staffer about questions you think your senator should be asking Janet Yellen, the comments section at the end of this letter would be an appropriate place to do so. Your comments will get read. Be polite, offer links to supporting documents, and have fun. I'm sure I've missed several important questions, including ones you'll think I should have listed, so this is your opportunity to get them in front of the right people. Whether they will get asked is a different matter entirely, of course. Finally, I am assuming that Yellen will be confirmed. While I would favor a Fed chair with a different economic philosophy, that is not going to happen. So rather than fantasizing about what is not going to happen, let's think about what we would like to actually learn. The Fed's Dilemma Conveniently, Ray Dalio and his team at Bridgewater penned an essay this week highlighting the Fed's dilemma. I offer a few key paragraphs and a chart or two as a setup to my list of questions. Turning right to their very prescient comments: In the old days central banks moved interest rates to run monetary policy. By watching the flows, we could see how lowering interest rates stimulated the economy by 1) reducing debt service burdens which improved cash flows and spending, 2) making it easier to buy items marked on credit because the monthly payments declined, which raised demand (initially for interest rate sensitive items like durable goods and housing) and 3) producing a positive wealth effect because the lower interest rate would raise the present value of most investment assets (and we saw how raising interest rates has had the opposite effect). All that changed when interest rates hit 0%; "printing money" (QE) replaced interest-rate changes. Because central banks can only buy financial assets, quantitative easing drove up the prices of financial assets and did not have as broad of an effect on the economy. The Fed's ability to stimulate the economy became increasingly reliant on those who experience the increased wealth trickling it down to spending and incomes, which happened in decreasing degrees (for logical reasons, given who owned the assets and their decreasing marginal propensities to consume). As shown in the charts below, the marginal effects of wealth increases on economic activity have been declining significantly. The Fed's dilemma is that its policy is creating a financial market bubble that is large relative to the pickup in the economy that it is producing. If it were targeting asset prices, it would tighten monetary policy to curtail the emerging bubble, whereas if it were targeting economic conditions, it would have a slight easing bias. In other words, 1) the Fed is faced with a difficult choice, and 2) it is losing its effectiveness." (In the following charts HH stands for "Household.") John Mauldin We expect this limit to worsen. As the Fed pushes asset prices higher and prospective asset returns lower, and cash yields can't decline, the spread between the prospective returns of risky assets and those of safe assets (i.e. risk premia) will shrink at the same time as the riskiness of risky assets will not decline, changing the reward-to-risk ratio in a way that will make it more difficult to push asset prices higher and create a wealth effect. Said differently, at higher prices and lower expected returns the compensation for taking risk will be too small to get investors to bid prices up and drive prospective returns down further. If that were to happen, it would become difficult for the Fed to produce much more of a wealth effect. If that were the case at the same time as the trickling down of the wealth effect to spending continues to diminish, which seems likely, the Fed's power to affect the economy would be greatly reduced. What Would Yellen Do? With that as a setup, let's turn to our hypothetical hearing. (Insert a picture of your favorite senator here.) With the hope that we will get a glimpse of what a Janet Yellen chairmanship of the Fed will actually look like, let's think about what we would like to know: Vice-Chairman Yellen, thank you for agreeing to attend this hearing. We have already interviewed you extensively for your present position, so I believe that most members of the committee and Senate already believe that you are qualified to be chairperson. Therefore I would like to use this opportunity to learn a little more about the thinking that goes on with regard to Federal Reserve monetary policy. In the spirit of the transparency that has been a hallmark of the Bernanke Federal Reserve, I would like you to shed a little light on the thinking and philosophy that will guide the Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of Janet Yellen. Here are a few questions that I believe we would all like answers to. a. Â Is there a theoretical limit in your mind as to the size to which the Fed's balance sheet should be allowed to grow? If so, what is that amount? Simply saying that this number would be dependent upon future economic data would imply that you have no true idea of the limit and are making up the rules as you go along. Perhaps we are indeed in unexplored territory for monetary policy and it is appropriate to adjust policies based upon unfolding economic events; but if that is the case, what are the guidelines you would use?b. Â Given the time lag required to realize the impact of monetary policy upon the economy, at what point and by what standard might you determine that the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve had reached its limit and that any further stimulus must be the responsibility of the Congress and the executive branch?c. Â Is there a discussion within the Federal Reserve that balance-sheet expansion has the potential to produce an asset bubble? a. Â What data was the Federal Reserve looking at that caused it to back away from even a small reduction in the amount of quantitative easing?b. Â Given that the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve is $4 trillion, what was the thought behind not reducing the ongoing increase of the balance sheet by a mere $10 billion a month?c. Â All things considered, $10 billion would seem a rather negligible amount. Were you concerned that the economy might not be able to handle even such a small reduction in quantitative easing? a. Â What do you think of this view?b. Â If you agree with this, are you concerned that such a policy shift might encourage a dollar "carry trade"? By that I mean that banks and other financial institutions might be encouraged to borrow in dollars to invest in all manners of financial engineering projects, especially overseas, given that the cost of borrowing would be so cheap. This is different from traditional banking in that it would not foster lending for productive domestic purposes such as the expansion of plants or the purchase of productivity-enhancing equipment.c. Â Given the problems we have seen with carry-trade currencies, especially the Japanese yen, how far out do you think forward guidance should god. Â Again, viewing the experience of Japan, carry-trade currencies seem to strengthen unduly, apart from natural trade and investment flows. Further, given the extraordinary developments in energy production in the United States and the reduction in the trade deficit, it is quite possible the dollar could strengthen rather dramatically on its own. Do you agree that positioning the dollar as a potential carry-trade currency would strengthen the dollar? Is that a good thing in your view?e. Â Given that the strength of the dollar is at least nominally (policy-wise) in the purview of the US Treasury Department, what kind of coordination with the Treasury do you think would be appropriate in extending forward guidance for a very-low-rate regime into 2017? a. Â There has been a significant amount of research which suggests that the wealth effect is no longer operative in the United States. Do you agree with this?b. Â If you do believe in the wealth effect, where is the research, beyond theoretical models, that supports your view?c. Â If you do not agree that current monetary policy is in effect a trickle-down monetary policy, then what do you believe is the transfer mechanism from quantitative easing to the general public? 6. Â Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly taken credit for the rise in the stock market from his policies of quantitative easing. Do you think he's right? In pursuing QE, has the Federal Reserve taken upon itself an implicit third mandate, that is, to support the level of the stock market? Should that be the Fed's responsibility? The Fed seems to be facing two major risks:Â first, premature tapering disrupting markets and triggering global turmoil across asset classes, thereby threatening the fragile economy recovery; second, delayed tapering further fueling asset price bubbles, which could burst eventually and do major damage. The September decision suggested a Fed more worried about the fragile recovery than about the potential for asset bubbles and other longer term problems associated with extended liquidity injections.Â Whereas it had originally assumed that a gradual tapering would result in a gradual market reaction, it now appears that the situation is much more binary. If so, the hurdles for tapering might be substantially higher than originally thought. a. Â Do you agree with that assessment, and if not, why?b. Â The Bank of England published the following chart in Q3 2011. It tells the story of their expectation that while QE was in operation there would be a massive rise in real asset prices, but that this would dissipate and unwind over time, starting at the point at which the asset purchases were complete. It also suggests that they felt it possible that real asset prices would fall after the withdrawal of quantitative easing. Did the Federal Reserve hold internal discussions (such as those evidently held at the Bank of England) regarding what would happen with the withdrawal of QE? Given the recent market response to the suggestion of tapering, was the possibility of a fall in asset prices accounted for in your decision to pursue quantitative easing? John Mauldin c. Â Has the Federal Reserve has, in reality, created a form of "monetary trap" for itself through its extensive use of quantitative easing? That is, do you see a way in which the Federal Reserve can exit QE without having a negative effect on the stock market, at least initially? And should the Federal Reserve care? a. Â Explain to us the economic rationale behind artificially lowering rates for an extended period of time, which penalizes savers at the expense of equity holders.b. Â Do you believe that consumer spending fostered by quantitative easing is greater than the consumer spending lost by decreased returns to savers and investors on their fixed-income investments? Is there any data that suggests this is turning out to be the case?c. Â If there is a greater good for the economy at large in pursuing massive QE, can you show us the research that proves it and explain why retirees should be content with your policies?d. Â Do you have suggestions for those who have saved all their lives and are now being forced to either reduce their standard of living or dip into their savings? FRED a. Â As chairperson of the Federal Reserve, which of the two mandates would you consider to be a higher priority in a time of rising inflation?b. Â Are you prepared, as Chairman Volcker was in the early '80s, to raise interest rates in order to protect the value of money, in spite of the harm it caused to employment? As a follow-on, I would also like to know what, if anything, you would have done differently from Chairman Volcker. a. Â How can we trust your models and your policy projections when the Fedâ€™s forecasts have been so wrong for so many years? Why does the Fed persist, to this day, in the use of models that have been so consistently bad at predicting the future?b. Â Will you be basing your monetary policy on projections generated by existing, clearly faulty models, or do you anticipate a change in the construction of your models? a. Â Can you explain to us precisely how monetary policy is supposed to work to improve employment? What is the transfer mechanism from quantitative easing to higher employment?b. Â If you were designing a central bank system from scratch, would you include an employment mandate? Where do you think the primary responsibility for establishing an environment for full employment should rest, with the federal government or the Federal Reserve? The Questions That Will Not Be Asked The above questions will start the discussion, but I'm well aware that some of the questions I would really like to ask will have no chance to make it into the dialogue. These go to the very concept of a central bank. In my latest book,Â Code Red,Â I fully acknowledge the need for a central bank, but my view of its purpose is quite a bit more limited than is envisioned in the current manifestation. How can 12 men and women sit on a committee and think they can fine-tune the economy without creating imbalances and unintended consequences? Central banks should be for emergencies and for regulating banking institutions and making sure the playing field is level. They should not be responsible for the fate of the players on the field. Current central bank policy has rewarded bankers and holders of assets. In an environment where everyone seems to be increasingly worried about the divide between the 1% and the 99%, our central bank has designed and implemented a policy that is explicitly rewarding the 1% to the detriment of savers and retirees. It is the rich who have assets and the poor who have liabilities. If you are looking for a reason why the spread between the rich and the poor is widening, one driver (and I admit there are others) is the central bank policies of the developed world. Let me end by sharing the sentiments expressed by Ben Hunt this week after he had read the numerous academic papers that have recently been released. I totally share this sentiment, and he expresses it well: I started writing this email as a detailed analysis of three monetary policy papers recently published by various Fed functionaries, papers that give a peek into how the Fed thinks about their role in the world and that have received some significant attention this week by our media arbiters of taste in articles such as "Fed Forward Guidance Proves Effective, NY Fed Research Says" and "Fed Study: Rate Peg Off Mark." Interpreting the meaning and impact of papers like this (and the media narrative around them) is a bread and butter topic for Epsilon Theory posts, as I feel a duty to read and report on these papers so you don't have to. It's not a pleasant duty. Frankly, these papers frustrate me to tears, as they are written as post hoc "scientific" justifications of value-laden social assumptions and policy conclusions, not as an honest search for a truth that's larger than the local bureaucratic imperative. They're also â€¦ boring. As is the long analysis I wrote. So let's skip all that and go straight to the conclusion. Spoiler Alert! The Fed believes that they are saving the world, and that any problems that persist in the world can be eliminated by doing more of what they've been doing and doing it for longer. I know this comes as a complete surprise to anyone who's been paying the least amount of attention over the past few years, but there you have it. That's what these papers say. These papers say nothing that is terribly novel or interesting in terms of their content or intended purpose. The only interesting thing is how much media attention they are receiving and whatÂ thatÂ means. The triumphal procession of these papers is a reminder that the academic and bureaucratic capture of the Fed is complete, and that leads to what are (to me, anyway) much more interesting questions than the inside baseball topics of what these papers might imply for Yellen's policy preferences: 1) Â Has the academic and bureaucratic capture of US monetary policy been duplicated in other policy areas, such as national security and healthcare?2) Â Is there a common academic and bureaucratic response across these policy areas to the economic and political duress of the past 10 years, such that emergency policy actions against immediate threats have been transformed into permanent insurance programs against future and potential threats?3) Â Is this the common thread woven through the three most important and controversial policies of our day: QE, Obamacare, and NSA eavesdropping?4) Â Are there useful lessons to be drawn from the last time we went through such a wholesale redefinition of the *meaning* of government policy, back in the 1930s?5) Â What are the structural consequences for markets and investing that stem from this redefinition?

Recovery? What recovery? Europeâ€™s single currency area may no longer be suffering from the bond market turmoil which dominated the headlines in 2011 and the first half of 2012, but it remains mired in an economic, financial and political crisis. The eurozone is still struggling to turn the corner. While the European Central Bank (ECB) deserves credit for confounding those who believed it had been asleep at the wheel while deflation loomed, its decision last week to cut its key policy rate to just a whisker above zero at a time when the eurozone economy is supposed to be recovering raises more questions than answers. The rate cut will do little to address the root causes (and effects) of ultra-low inflation â€” and in some countries outright deflation â€” in the eurozone. That it was strongly opposed by members of the ECBâ€™s governing council representing the blocâ€™s "northern" member states only serves to accentuate the political divisions that plague the eurozone. The most conspicuous one is over proposals to establish a eurozone-wide resolution mechanism for banks. Not only is Germany reluctant to share more risks, itâ€™s also wary of ceding more sovereignty over its own lenders. In the eyes of the eurozoneâ€™s southern European members, Germany is showing its true face: opposing the necessary steps to move from a shaky monetary union to a more secure economic and political one. In Germanyâ€™s eyes, however, limited progress in structural reforms, particularly in Italy but also in recently downgraded France, underscore the dangers of the ECBâ€™s highly accommodative monetary policies. Thereâ€™s an inescapable feeling that a lack of trust between "northern" and "southern" member states is preventing the eurozone from overcoming the crisis â€” this at a time when the economies of France, Italy and Spain are expected to barely grow next year.
REUTERS/Stephen LamA chain of block erupters used for Bitcoin mining is pictured at the Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, California, October 28, 2013.Many Bitcoin believers think that the digital currency will one day become the pre-eminent currency of the internet. They basically see it becoming the internet's version of gold in that it's naturally scarce, independent, virtually impossible to manipulate, and crucially suited for a digital world when money ought to be able to be moved seamlessly and at no cost. Well here's a tip: If you think that this is true, then never use Bitcoin in a transaction. As more people have gotten into Bitcoin, the price has gone way up. Virtually everyone who has ever bought anything in Bitcoin has been a huge loser, who would have been better suited just holding onto the Bitcoins instead. Remember the pizza that was purchased for $25 in Bitcoins years back? Had the person not bought that pizza, it would be worth nearly $3 million. That purchase was a catastrophic decision, as that was probably the most expensive pizza of all time. Of course this presents a Catch-22. How can Bitcoin become a real currency if it's not used in transactions? And why would anyone use it in transactions if becoming a real currency offers so much more price appreciation? This contradiction is a core problem, and it's a reason why it's probably doomed to fail (real currencies don't have this issue, since central banks prevent rapid price appreciation, and they mandate that the currency be used). But really, if you're thinking that Bitcoin is going to be huge, it'd be insane and irresponsible to buy anything with it.
REUTERS/Jason LeeChina's 3rd plenum,Â a meeting of the Communist Partyâ€™s Central Committee, has been under way since November 9. Analysts have been looking for some reforms on state-owned enterprises, though nothing as extreme as privatization, reforms to the Hukou (residency permit) system, financial sector reform, and property tax reform to name a few. But Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, writes in a Project Syndicate column that optimism surrounding the 3rd Plenum and the party's "ability to push through market-oriented reforms also ignores the real obstacles to future growth and prosperity." Pei argues that there is a huge difference between the 3rd Plenum of 1978 when Deng Xiaoping pushed through reforms and opened up China's economy.Â  Some expect this to be the time for president Xi Jinping to shine, but Pei explains why this would be hard: "Compared with the two previous breakthroughs in reforming Chinaâ€™s economy, in 1978 and 1992, Xi faces a different environment and a much tougher challenge. Opponents of Deng Xiaopingâ€™s reforms were ideologically driven; they had no personal stake in the Maoist political economy. Defeating them required building a winning coalition within the party, discrediting the communist ideology, and rallying public support, all of which Deng did. "Today, by contrast, members of the ruling elite benefit directly and immensely from the state-dominated economy. Market-oriented reform, by leveling the competitive playing field, would hurt their interests and reduce their privileges, making fierce opposition likely. Only by mobilizing pressure outside the party-state can these insiders be forced to accept some of the decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that Chinaâ€™s economy needs. " The 3rd plenum is a closed-door meeting that will wrap up on Nov 12. Read the entire piece at Project Syndicate Â»
REUTERS/ Alfred Cheng JinThis past week the U.S. was graced with some surprisingly strong economic data. GDP for Q3 solidly beat expectations, and Non-Farm Payrolls for October were well-ahead of the expected pace, even with the government shutdown. Those strong numbers likely raise the odds that the Federal Reserve will begin the so-called "taper" in December, rather than in, say, March of next year. The "taper" refers to the action of slowing down the pace of the monthly bond purchases that are conducted through QE. But while the Fed is looking to slow the pace of QE, there's growing talk that it will find new ways to stimulate the economy using monetary policy. This week, Goldman's Jan Hatzius argued that in addition to tapering, the Fed will reduce the threshold level of unemployment at which it would consider tightening interest rates. Currently, the Fed says it won't think about tightening rates until unemployment falls to 6.5%. Hatzius believes — based on two papers that have been published by Fed economists — that the Fed will lower this level to 6.0%, which constitutes a form of easing inasmuch as it signals to the market that ultra-low rates will remain ultra-low for even longer than is being signaled now. This, theoretically, has the effect of lowering long-term interest rates and providing stimulus that way. So, on one hand, the Fed might engage in some tightening (slowing the pace of QE), while with the other hand do more loosening (reducing the threshold at which it would consider raising interest rates). So what gives? There were two fantastic blog posts this week that explain what's going on. The first was from Kevin Ferry at The Contrarian Corner who explained that QE is essentially an attempt to stimulate the economy by increasing the quantity of money out there, whereas in the past the Fed tried guiding the economy by directly guiding interest rates. Ending QE but doing more with forward guidance is essentially a handoff and a return to the old days, in that the Fed is going to try guiding interest rates again. (in this case very long ones). Economist Tim Duy wrote something very similar later in the week: Bottom Line:  Policymakers would like to normalize policy by moving away from asset purchases to interest rates.  Emphasizing forward guidance is part of that process.  Incoming research suggests not only that threshold based forward guidance is effective, but has room to be even more effective.  That should be a comfort to policymakers who worry that ending asset purchases will excessively tighten financial conditions; they have a tool to change the mix of policy while leaving the level of accommodation unchanged.  Whether they use it or not is another question.  There has clearly been some discomfort among policymakers regarding changing the unemployment threshold.  This suggests it would not necessarily be an immediate replacement for ending asset purchases.  That said, it is difficult to see how the current threshold is meaningful at all if the Fed is still purchasing assets when the threshold is breached.  Indeed, the current low level of unemployment relative to the threshold, combined with clear indications that the Fed has no intention of raising rates anytime soon, argues by itself that a change in the thresholds is a likely scenario in the months ahead. With the strong data, the "taper" chatter is going to heat up. But it's important to keep an eye on what's going on. There's a good chance that what the Fed will do is not desire to tighten, but just alter its strategy towards one of guiding interest rates again, as it did in pre-crisis days.

But the stock markets will be open. There isn't too much major economic data to follow. But it'll arguably be the beginning of the Janet Yellen era of monetary policy. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Yellen heads to Washington Thursday for her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary All-time highs and stretched valuations have some people freaked out that we may be doomed for a stock market crash. Societe Generale's Alain Bokobza is concerned, but he isn't quite so dramatic:  "Further S&amp;P 500 progression from current level is unlikely as U.S. government bond yields head higher in 2014. We expect U.S. government bond yields to approach 4% by Dec. 2014. At that level of yield, and with the normalisation of the risk premiums from rather cheap today (4.65%) to their long-term average (3.9%, which is an optimistic assumption), this would leave no room for U.S. equities to continue progressing after already five years of sustained equity index rise (+51% total return since the Lehman crisis). "Potential for a near-term correction in U.S. equities can’t be ruled out. The FED will eventually bring tapering back on the agenda in 2014. After all, does real GDP growth of 2.8% in the last quarter really deserve not only zero rates but also active monetary injection? Our analysis suggests that a U.S. government bond yield between 3% and 3.5% could trigger a correction of between -12% and -22% on the current ERP." 
TomoNewsThe big story of the weekend for many China/media-types is the front page New York Times story about how Bloomberg has allegedly been spiking stories deemed too controversial for China. Bloomberg is denying killing any stories, but the report has been picked up by people like James Fallows and places like Gawker, and the Financial Times has a nice follow-up that suggests one story spiked may have been about financial links between China's richest man and government officials. Obviously, journalists are fascinated by a story that appears to show a worrying example of a news organization acquiescing to state pressure for business reasons. But there's another, stranger aspect to the case — the story appears to have been first broken in an animated video from Taiwan's Next Media Animation on Friday. Here's that video:  Next Media Animation have gained international recognition for their animated videos about hot news topics. Generally, the videos function as sort of funny explainers, complete with silly sound effects and comic exaggeration — here's a video they did about Manti Te'o, for example. This new video, however, appears to be the first time that they've broken serious news with a video. (The video was uploaded to YouTube one day before the Times story went live, and the Times journalist who wrote the story has referenced it in a blog post). Could animated news be the future? Well,  no, probably not, but this whole story is certainly a strange example of changing media environments.  
China'sÂ surveillance networks are believed to be some of the largest and most ambitious in the world â€” in just a decade, the country has gone from having virtually noÂ surveillance cameras to some 20 million, according to NPR. The Chinese government claims that the cameras can combat crime and maintain "social stability," but there is a serious concern within the country that maybe things have gone too far. For an illuminating (and perhaps worrying) example of the country's surveillance camera madness, check out the photograph below. It's one of many photographs of a junction in Shanghai's Baoshan District that spread on social media recently (you can see more photographs on NetEase): Via Netease According to Hug China, that bar you can see was home to some 60 cameras at one point, though after pictures of the bizarre cluster of cameras began to go viral the local government removed them. Reports in the Chinese press claimed they were put there by a local electronics company for testing purposes, but Chinese netizens were still worried â€” "From every angle, no blind side, it is capable of distinguish male from female mosquito!" one NetEase commenter wrote. There may be a small glimmer of hope for Chinese citizens concerned about their privacy, however â€” a recent report in the South China Morning Post found that China's notorious smog problem has rendered much of the country's expensive surveillance system "useless."

Kevin Smith/Business InsiderFacebook made a startling admission in its earnings announcement this month: it was seeing a "decrease in daily users, specifically among teens". In other words, teenagers are still on Facebook; they're just not using it as much as they did. It was a landmark statement, since teens are the demographic who often point the rest of us towards the next big thing. Their gradual exodus to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and KakaoTalk boils down to Facebook becoming a victim of its own success. The road to gaining nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users has seen the mums, dads, aunts and uncles of the generation who pioneered Facebook join it too, spamming their walls with inspirational quotes and images of cute animals, and (shock, horror) commenting on their kids' photos. No surprise, then, that Facebook is no longer a place for uninhibited status updates about pub antics, but an obligatory communication tool that younger people maintain because everyone else does. All the fun stuff is happening elsewhere. On their mobiles. When mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp first emerged in 2009, they looked like a threat to mobile carriers. Everyone from Vodafone to Dutch operator KPN was mentioning them in sales calls. Mobile operators are estimated to have lost $23bn in SMS revenue in 2012 due to messaging apps, which host free instant messages through a phone's data connection, which these days is often unlimited. Now these apps are becoming a threat to established social networks too. WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the UK and on half the country's iPhones, according to Mobile Marketing Magazine, has more than 350 million monthly active users globally. That makes it the biggest messaging app in the world by users, with even more active users than social media darling Twitter, which counts 218 million. About 90% of the population of Brazil uses messaging apps, three-quarters of Russians, and half of Britons, according to mobile consultancy Tyntec. WhatsApp alone is on more than 95% of all smartphones in Spain. The power users and early adopters of these apps, the ones you're most likely to see tapping their thumbs over a tiny screen, are under 25. Part of the reason is that gradual encroachment of the grey-haired ones on Facebook. Another is what messaging apps have to offer: private chatting with people you are friends with in real life. Instead of passively stalking people you barely know on Facebook, messaging apps promote dynamic real-time chatting with different groups of real-life friends, real life because to connect with them on these apps you will typically already have their mobile number. The trend flies in the face of recurring criticism of young people – that their social lives are largely virtual – when many more are in fact embracing the virtues of privacy and services like WhatsApp, which shun advertising. "I only use WhatsApp to communicate and send pics these days," said Natalie West, a twentysomething financial sales associate in London. In the last few years she has used Facebook less and less because she doesn't want "the whole world to know" what she's doing. When people set up events and get-togethers on Facebook, West and her boyfriend tend to reply on WhatsApp instead because "it's more personal". For similar reasons, some 78% of teenagers and young people use mobile messengers to plan a meet-up with friends, according to research advisory firm mobileYouth. Another factor is the rise of the selfie, often silly self-portraits taken at arm's length with a mobile. Almost half of the photos on Instagram feeds among people aged 14 to 21 in the UK are selfies, according to mobileYouth. Sending those photos via a mobile messaging service is safer than broadcasting them on Facebook, since they're less likely to be seen by a boss or dozens of Facebook friends you forgot you had. Selfies are even bigger on Snapchat, the evanescent photo sharing app that deletes a photo several seconds after it has been viewed. With around 150 million active users, the service has inevitably become a favoured way for teens to send sexy or even naked photos of themselves, an ill-advised practice known as "sexting". But teens also love Snapchat because it allows them to send inane photos of themselves without fear of leaving a permanent digital footprint.The California-based app is seen as so hot, with so much potential for growth, that it has already been pegged with a $2-$4bn valuation in the Silicon Valley tech community. Estimates are even higher for WhatsApp, which makes money through an annual subscription; some observers suggest it could be worth $5bn or more. The final, big reason why young people are gravitating towards messaging apps is that many of these apps no longer do just messaging. They are social networks. The best examples come out of Asia, with messaging platforms KakaoTalk (South Korea), WeChat (China) and LINE (Japan). All have tens of millions of users, with WeChat boasting more than 200 million, and take their services beyond offering straight messaging to games, stickers and music sharing. Before you write off digital stickers as inane, they are a decent moneyspinner for LINE: of the $58m the company made in sales in the first quarter of 2013, half came from selling games and 30%, or roughly $17m, from sales of its 8,000 different stickers. Some are free or, in Spain where LINE has 15 million registered users, cost around €1.99. Often users choose stickers instead of words when they need to express themselves, one LINE executive said; it's known to have helped couples get over fights more easily by offering multiple stickers to say sorry. Gaming is another money-maker. With KakaoTalk, which is thought to be on 90% of all smartphones in South Korea, registered users can choose from more than 100 games they can play with one another, and games alone helped the company generate $311m in sales in the first half of 2013. A couple of non-Asian messaging apps such as Kik (Canada) and Tango (US) are turning themselves into full-fledged platforms too, inviting software engineers to create games that run on their apps. They will typically let developers take home half the revenue while taking a 20% cut. App stores such as Google Play and Apple's App Store take the remaining 30%. Tango took all this a step further this month when it partnered with music-streaming Spotify to allow its 60 million monthly users to share music clips with one another. Two years ago Spotify launched a similar partnership with Facebook. "What we're seeing in the messaging space is an explosion in growth," said Spotify's vice-president of strategic partnerships, Tom Hsieh, who hinted there would be partnerships with other messaging apps in the future too. "I don't think there's been a clear winner [among them] yet." It is worth noting that, with so many of these apps getting into games, stickers and now music sharing, it is becoming harder to define them as messaging services. "I think there is some misunderstanding here in how we categorise these apps," says Pavel Durov, who founded Russia's version of Facebook, VK.com, and recently launched a mobile messaging service called Telegram. "They are social networks. You have a social graph there; a newsfeed; you have profile pages. Many things that are related to social networks by definition." Social chat apps is another way to define them, says Gartner mobile analyst Brian Blau. "People are sometimes using three or four of these apps." Many of the Asian chat apps such as Kakao and LINE are struggling to appeal to US users, though, because of the stylised nature of their interfaces – vivid colors, manga-style characters and lettering. "We're used to being a little more subdued," says Blau, who is based in the US. In the race to become platforms with extra frills, the big exception is WhatsApp. Founder Jan Koum has said publicly that he has no plans for his service to start providing games. Koum and his co-founder Brian Acton, both former Yahoo managers who were one of the first to create a mobile messaging app for smartphones with WhatsApp, see it almost as a pure communication utility that should not be saddled with extra features that might slow things down. "That's what's happened with Facebook now," says Neeraj Arora, business manager for WhatsApp, which is based in Mountain View, California. "It tries to do everything for everyone. Our core is communication." That is a somewhat conservative approach compared to most other messaging platforms, yet WhatsApp is still quietly broadening out. In the same way Facebook first rolled our Facebook Connect in 2008 to allow people to use their profiles to like or comment on other websites, WhatsApp recently unveiled an instruction set known as an API that lets other mobile apps share content through WhatsApp too. The roll-out is still in its infancy, but after one music streaming service in the Middle East added the WhatsApp sharing button, its was surprised to find its users sharing 50% more songs via WhatsApp than Facebook. The future for these messaging apps is still uncertain. Some in the industry expect buyouts from big internet companies like Google, which was rumoured to have flirted with WhatsApp earlier this year. Facebook already has its own popular Messenger service, while Apple has iMessage – both are popular, but lack the gaming ambitions of Asian chat apps. Still, it is hard to imagine these players consolidating to create a global social network as big as Facebook. "If you look at the landscape, it's geographic," says Greg Woock, CEO of the US calling and messaging service Pinger. "We dominate the US, WhatsApp dominates Europe, LINE owns Japan." China's WeChat is trying to break out of that mould. Its executives have talked about expanding internationally, and custom building its app to suit local tastes for how it should look. "We have put a lot of thought into how to take it outside of China," Martin Lau, the president of WeChat owner Tencent, said at a recent conference. Who dies, survives or thrives may ultimately depend on how well any of these players can make money. Snapchat, arguably a photo-sharing service more than a messaging app, has yet to explain how it will do so. WhatsApp says it is already profitable thanks to its annual subscription fees; Pinger relies on advertisements; WeChat, LINE, Kakao and Kik sell stickers and games. Some of these services are bound to go out of fashion, and a few business models will fail, and they're still a world away from the $2.1bn in sales that Facebook brought in this last quarter. But there is little doubt that millions of teens will use these apps more and more, and older demographics will eventually join them. There's a good chance that will continue to be at the expense of Facebook. Parmy Olson is a technology writer for Forbes magazine in San Francisco.

WhatsApp Started in 2009 by two ex-Yahoo staff, this smartphone messaging system handles more than 10 billion messages a day and is reckoned to have more than 250m users worldwide. One of the most popular paid-for apps on any platform, and a threat to telecoms companies which charge for texts. Snapchat Allows users to send "view once'"photos, specifying how long the photo will remain on the recipient's device.

Kevin Smith/Business InsiderFacebook made a startling admission in its earnings announcement this month: it was seeing a "decrease in daily users, specifically among teens". In other words, teenagers are still on Facebook; they're just not using it as much as they did. It was a landmark statement, since teens are the demographic who often point the rest of us towards the next big thing. Their gradual exodus to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and KakaoTalk boils down to Facebook becoming a victim of its own success. The road to gaining nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users has seen the mums, dads, aunts and uncles of the generation who pioneered Facebook join it too, spamming their walls with inspirational quotes and images of cute animals, and (shock, horror) commenting on their kids' photos. No surprise, then, that Facebook is no longer a place for uninhibited status updates about pub antics, but an obligatory communication tool that younger people maintain because everyone else does. All the fun stuff is happening elsewhere. On their mobiles. When mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp first emerged in 2009, they looked like a threat to mobile carriers. Everyone from Vodafone to Dutch operator KPN was mentioning them in sales calls. Mobile operators are estimated to have lost $23bn in SMS revenue in 2012 due to messaging apps, which host free instant messages through a phone's data connection, which these days is often unlimited. Now these apps are becoming a threat to established social networks too.

REUTERS/ Lucas JacksonNews broke recently that Barclays has suspended six traders in an internal probe looking at whether its employees were rigging the foreign exchange market. There's also RBS, who emailed clients Wednesday to essentially say, Yikes, we're going to go ahead and take a look at what our traders are doing in the minutes before rates are set. Regulators in the U.S., Asia, and U.K. have all opened investigations, with multiple banks implicated. Even JP Morgan, already very much in the penalty box, has said that various regulators are prying into their currency trading practices. Here we go again! This particular rigging saga is not to be confused with another well-known scandal — so-called Liborgate —where traders manipulated the short-term interest rate benchmark. But it looks like this (fairly similar) one may be the next big Traders Doing Very Bad Things fracas to rock the financial world. We're here to answer your questions. Hey, what's going on here? We'll start with the basics. The foreign exchange market — "forex" — is the biggest market in the world, though it doesn't get as much mainstream press as its stock and bond brethren. Traders buy and sell money on the forex market. "The FX market is like the Wild West," one forex expert told Bloomberg. "It's buyer beware." That's in part because the market is lightly regulated and a ton of currency trading happens in the shadowy realm outside of exchanges. This particular currency rigging story has been going on for some time, with Bloomberg reporting in June that traders at some of the world's biggest banks had been toying with rates by pushing through trades before the 60-second window when the FX benchmarks are set. What is the rate they are messing with? That would be the the WM/ Reuters rate. Here's a good description: The WM/Reuters rate set at 4 pm London time is considered the benchmark by many companies and investors because more than 40 percent of daily global FX trading is done in London. It is the nearest thing to a closing price in a 24-hour, self-regulated market. For the big, frequently traded currencies — like USDEUR (dollar/euro) —the rate gets published every half hour. For the little guys, every hour. Without getting too detailed, the rate is calculated by taking the median of total trades during a 60-second period every half hour. "If there aren’t enough transactions between a pair of currencies during the reference period, the rate is based on the median of traders’ orders, which are offers to sell or bids to buy," Bloomberg reports. "Rates for the other, less-widely traded currencies are calculated using quotes during a two-minute window." Got it? Not really. Why is this rate important? Like Libor, the WM/Reuters rate is peculiar to those outside the financial world. Actually, many people in the financial world probably don't pay that much attention to it (unless they are concerned with currency trading). But the rate matters to society at large because, as Morningstar estimates, $3.6 trillion in things like pension funds and savings accounts can fluctuate in value when the rate moves. Now I'm listening. So how do traders mess with the rate?  Traders at these big banks are market-makers. They are buying and selling for clients and for the bank itself. In that June report, Bloomberg spoke with some traders who described how their contemporaries managed to exploit the WM/Reuters rate. The gist: Knowing that their traders will try to trade against them, customers wait until just before 4 p.m. to place their orders. So traders get the orders minutes (plural) before 4 p.m. and then in the minute (singular) before the 60-second window, traders adjust their own position because the large order they just got from some index fund will move the market. It's called "banging the close," which, of course it is. Here's the nitty gritty if you're interested, from Bloomberg: One trader with more than a decade of experience said that if he received an order at 3:30 p.m. to sell 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in exchange for Swiss francs at the 4 p.m. fix, he would have two objectives: to sell his own euros at the highest price and also to move the rate lower so that at 4 p.m. he could buy the currency from his client at a lower price. He would profit from the difference between the reference rate and the higher price at which he sold his own euros, he said. A move in the benchmark of 2 basis points, or 0.02 percent, would be worth 200,000 francs ($216,000), he said. "If they didn’t do so, [the traders] said, they risked losing money for their banks," according to Bloomberg. Are these traders just smart... or are they jerks? Or are they smart jerks? Or are they smart jerks doing something illegal? It kind of depends on what your baseline theory of trading/financial regulation is. If, as Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine desribes, you believe that the fundamental precept of regulation is that A) Regulators attempt to write the rules B) Banks sit down and try to figure out how circumnavigate those rules and C) Banks are way better at it for a variety of reasons, then you might call this whole forex gambit a "risk strategy" instead of "manipulation." As in, this isn't free money, it's merely a tactic to mitigate a trader's risk. It could backfire! One of the whistleblower traders told Bloomberg that the strategy doesn't necessarily work with A) highly-traded currencies where the market is so big or B) If someone else comes in and messes with your bet during the 60-second window. Isn't this like Libor though? The Libor rate gets calculated by bank estimates, so that scandal was rigging in the truest sense of the word. If you want proof, we have hilarious traderspeak emails such as: Swiss Franc Trader: can u put 6m swiss libor in low pls? Primary Submitter: NO Swiss Franc Trader: should have pushed the door harder Primary Submitter: Whats it worth Swiss Franc Trader: ive got some sushi rolls from yesterday? Primary Submitter: ok low 6m , just for u The forex market rate is based on actual quotes, not bank estimates (or the promise of sushi).  Though, two of the trader sources told Bloomberg that dealers were colluding to move the rates, so maybe we'll eventually see a paper trail like the above. And, hey, traders are (maybe!) messing with a rate that has reverberations for our pensions. And there's this: In the space of 20 minutes on the last Friday in June, the value of the U.S. dollar jumped 0.57 percent against its Canadian counterpart, the biggest move in a month. Within an hour, two-thirds of that gain had melted away. The same pattern — a sudden surge minutes before 4 p.m. in London on the last trading day of the month, followed by a quick reversal — occurred 31 percent of the time across 14 currency pairs over two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market goes crazy and then corrects on the last day of the month... when clients are placing huge orders. Interesting.  So what's going to happen? It's hard to say exactly. Barclays suspended those six traders (including its head currency trader in London). A smattering of banks will probably cough up fines and fire traders and/or slap wrists. There's always a slight chance of criminal proceedings, but it's too soon to tell what regulators are going to game for. But they'll change the rules for the WM/Reuters rate, right? Sure! And then everyone on Wall Street will sit down and figure out how best to make money next.
AMC screencapI've been away for weeks now on a non-financial assignment (we have something unusual coming out in Rolling Stone in a few weeks) so I've fallen behind on some crazy developments on Wall Street. There are multiple scandals blowing up right now, including a whole set of ominous legal cases that could result in punishments so extreme that they might significantly alter the long-term future of the financial services sector. As one friend of mine put it, "Whatever those morons put aside for settlements, they'd better double it." Firstly, there's a huge mess involving possible manipulation of the world currency markets. This scandal is already drawing comparisons to the last biggest-financial-scandal-in-history (the Financial Times wondered about a "repeat Libor scandal"), the manipulation of interest rates via the gaming of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. The foreign exchange or FX market is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily trading volume of nearly $5 trillion. Regulators on multiple continents are investigating the possibility that at least four (and probably many more) banks may have been involved in widespread, Libor-style manipulation of currencies for years on end. One of the allegations is that traders have been gambling heavily before and after the release of the WM/Reuters rates, which like Libor are benchmark rates calculated privately by a small subset of financial companies that are perfectly positioned to take advantage of their own foreknowledge of pricing information. A month ago, Bloomberg reported that it had observed a pattern of spikes in trading in certain pairs of currencies at the same time, at 4 p.m. London time on the last trading day of the month, when WM/Reuters rates are released. From the article: In the space of 20 minutes on the last Friday in June, the value of the U.S. dollar jumped 0.57 percent against its Canadian counterpart, the biggest move in a month. Within an hour, two-thirds of that gain had melted away. The same pattern – a sudden surge minutes before 4 p.m. in London on the last trading day of the month, followed by a quick reversal – occurred 31 percent of the time across 14 currency pairs over two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the most frequently traded pairs, such as euro-dollar, it happened about half the time, the data show. The recurring spikes take place at the same time financial benchmarks known as the WM/Reuters (TRI) rates are set based on those trades… The Forex story broke at a time when the industry was already coping with price-fixing messes involving oil (the European commission is investigating manipulation of yet another Libor-like price-setting process here) and manipulation cases involving benchmark rates for precious metals and interest rate swaps. As Quartz put it after the FX story broke: For those keeping score: That means the world's key price benchmarks for interest rates, energy and currencies may now all be compromised. Perhaps most importantly, however, there's a major drama brewing over legal case in London tied to the Libor scandal. Guardian Care Homes, a British "residential home care operator," is suing the British bank Barclays for over $100 million for allegedly selling the company interest rate swaps based on Libor, which numerous companies have now admitted to manipulating, in a series of high-profile settlements. The theory of the case is that if Libor was not a real number, and was being manipulated for years as numerous companies have admitted, then the Libor-based swaps banks sold to companies like Guardian Care are inherently unenforceable. A ruling against the banks in this case, which goes to trial in April of next year in England, could have serious international ramifications. Suddenly, cities like Philadelphia and Houston, or financial companies like Charles Schwab, or a gazillion other buyers of Libor-based financial products might be able to walk away from their Libor-based contracts. Basically, every customer who's ever been sold a rotten swap product by a major financial company might now be able to get up from the table, extend two middle fingers squarely in the direction of Wall Street, and simply walk away from the deals. Nobody is mincing words about what that might mean globally. From a Reuters article on the Guardian Care case: "To unwind all Libor-linked derivative contracts would be financial Armageddon," said Abhishek Sachdev, managing director of Vedanta Hedging, which advises companies on interest rate hedging products. Concern over all of this grew even hotter last week with the latest Libor settlement, in which yet another major bank, the Dutch powerhouse Rabobank, got caught monkeying with the London rate. Rabobank paid over a billion in fines to American, British, Dutch and Japanese authorities and saw its professorial CEO, Piet Moerland, resign as a result of the probe. The investigation revealed the same disgusting stuff all of the other Libor probes had revealed – traders and various other mid-level bank sociopaths laughing and joking about rigging rates and screwing customers all over the world. From the WSJ: In a July 2006 electronic chat, an unidentified Rabobank trader was informed about the bank's plans to set Libor "obscenely high" that day, according to an exchange cited by the Justice Department. The trader responded, "oh dear . . . my poor customers . . . . hehehe!!" Here at home, virtually simultaneous to the Rabobank settlement, Fannie Mae filed a suit against nine banks – including Barclays Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN), Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan – for manipulating Libor, claiming that the mortgage-financing behemoth lost over $800 million due to manipulation of the benchmark rate by the banks. And virtually simultaneous to that, JP Morgan Chase disclosed that it is currently the target of no fewer than eight federal investigations, for activities ranging from possible bribery of foreign officials in Asia to allegations of improper mortgage-bond sales to . . . the Libor mess. "The scope and breadth of risky practices at JPMorgan are mind-boggling," Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner, told Bloomberg. The point of all of this is that any thought that the potential Chase settlement might begin a period of regulatory healing for it and other Wall Street banks appears to be wildly mistaken. If anything, the scope of potential liability for all the major banks, particularly in these market-rigging furors, appears to be growing in all directions. A half-year ago, it looked like the chief villains in the Libor mess at least were going to get away with writing relatively small checks. Back in March, a major private class-action suit filed by a gaggle of plaintiffs against the banks for Libor manipulation was tossed by a federal judge here in the southern District of New York on the seemingly preposterous grounds that a bunch of banks getting together to monkey with the value of world interest rates in this biggest-in-history financial collusion case was somehow now an antitrust issue. The banks in that case humorously implied that the victims might have done better to sue for fraud instead of manipulation ("The plaintiffs, I believe, are confusing a claim of being perhaps deceived," one bank lawyer put it, "with a claim for harm to competition"), and the judge seemed to agree. Moreover, when the plaintiffs' lawyers tried to make a point about the seemingly key fact that a series of governments had already concluded settlements with the banks for manipulating Libor, the judge – the Hon. Naomi Rice Buchwald – mocked the plaintiffs' lawyers for trying to ride to civil victory on a wave of government settlements: Wait a second. Your job here, as plaintiffs' counsel, looking for whopping legal fees, is not to piggyback on the government. Indeed, the reason that there are statutes that provide plaintiffs' counsel with attorney's fees is a recognition that the government has limited resources. The banks must have thought they'd hit the lottery, with this potentially deadly Libor suit suddenly stopped dead in its tracks by a grumpy federal judge with an apparent distaste for plaintiff lawyers who collect "whopping" legal fees. So the victims tried to take a different tack, appealing to a federal panel in an attempt to allow them to file their suits against the banks on a state-by-state level. But then, in a seemingly fatal blow to the private claims, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled in favor of the banks, sending the case right back into the courtroom of the same judge who'd dumped on the plaintiffs' lawyers and their "whopping fees." That was just a month ago, at the beginning of October, and back then it seemed like the banks might somehow escape the Libor mess with their necks intact. Now, a month later, yet another bank has been forced to cough up a billion dollars for Libor manipulation, Fannie Mae has filed a major suit on the same grounds, and the Guardian Care Homes case is not only alive but looking like a threat to cancel billions of dollars' worth of Libor-related contracts. Not only that, many of those same banks are being sucked into what potentially is an even uglier scandal involving currency manipulation. One gets the feeling that governments in all the major Western democracies would like to sweep these manipulation scandals under the rug. The only problem is that the scale of the misdeeds in these various markets is so enormous that even the most half-assed attempt at regulation will cause a million-car pileup. There's simply no way to do a damage calculation that won't wipe out the entire finance sector when you're talking about pervasive, ongoing manipulation of $5-trillion-a-day markets. That's the problem – there's no way to do a slap on the wrist in these cases. If they're guilty, they're done. Follow us: @rollingstone on Twitter | RollingStone on Facebook
In January(ish), PBS' investigative documentary series "Frontline" will air its special on SAC Capital, the once high-powered hedge fund that Friday agreed to plead guilty to insider trading and pay a $1.8 billion fine. SAC, which will now have to close its doors to outside investors, is headed by legendary trader Steve Cohen. According to the Feds, he's guilty of fostering a "culture of corporate corruption" and failing to supervise his traders as they used inside information to make incredible returns. Now "Frontline" has released video that it obtained during the making of its documentary â€” video that shows that Cohen may not have been totally clear on what "inside information" meant on Wall Street. Or at least, it seems like he doesn't understand it in a hypothetical situation lawyers gave him during his deposition. There's more video of Cohen saying that he relies on his council and hasn't read the "vague" rules on insider trading over at "Frontline." 
APOn Nov. 24, Swiss voters will go to the polls to vote on a radical new idea â€” limiting the monthly pay of the highest earners in Swiss firms to no greater than the yearly pay of the lowest earners. It's being called the 1:12 Initiative â€” and it sure has some people worried. To understand the context of the vote, you need to know two things about Switzerland. First, the country has a relatively unique system of direct democracy â€” if 100,000 people sign a proposed change to the constitution, or "popular initiatives," a referendum is held. If a majority of voters and cantons (Swiss states) agree with the proposal, the change can become law. The second factor is how these Swiss initiatives have been used recently. Earlier this year Swiss voters agreed to an idea proposed by entrepreneur Thomas Minder that limited executive (in his words, "fat cat") salaries of companies listed on the Swiss stock market. On the other end of the spectrum, a proposal to give every Swiss adult an unconditional income of $2,800 a month recently gained enough signatures to be voted on. The 1:12 Initiative lies somewhere between these two extremes in terms of its radical ambition, but its core idea comes from the same place â€” an angst in Switzerland, a country most famous for centuries of private banking, that executive pay and income inequality are out of control. To understand the thought process, Business Insider called David Roth, the leader of the youth wing of Swiss party the Social Democrats, and one of the architects of the plan. Roth explained that high executive salaries only became a big issue in 2002 or so, and by 2006/7 they became a public issue. The preparation for the 1:12 Initiative began in 2009. "It's really just a thought process that says no-one should earn more in a month than the lowest-paid person in the same company does in a year," Roth says. "You shouldn't just say a maximum salary, because what we really want is a relationship between the lowest and the highest. There are others who say that people shouldn't earn over, say, a million, but in our opinion it is not really the number." That sounds nice, but what would it look like in reality? Statistics published in the Swiss press suggest that many companies currently pay their CEOs salaries that are hundreds of times the salaries of their lowest-paid workers; for example, the ratio for health care company Roche is reportedly 1:236, and for pharmaceutical giant Novartis it's said to be 1:219. So, would a company where the CEO earns 12 million Swiss francs a year suddenly start paying its receptionist 1 million Swiss francs a year? Or will the receptionist's salary of 40,000 Swiss francs a year result in a CEO with a 480,000 Swiss franc salary? "It's wrong to say it will do one of those extremes," Roth counters. "I think it will be both. First of all the high salaries will go down, but then what will happen with the money that is available after that? We hope that some of it will go to the lower-paid workers." "The government of my district is predicting that if the initiative is accepted we would have lower tax of around 9 million Swiss francs. Next week I will be there in parliament and we will discuss tax reductions for companies and rich people, which will cost hundreds of millions of francs," Roth says. "[People] always think that the money that [executives] wouldn't be earning would just disappear, and that's just not the reality. The money won't just disappear. It'll probably go to lower-paid workers, it may also stay within the company and be reinvested. That ought to have a good effect on our economy." Others disagree. According to World Radio Switzerland, Novartis, Nestle, Bobst, and SBB sent thousands of employees letters asking them to vote no to the 1:12 initiative, arguing that it would make Switzerland a less desirable place to do business. Earlier this year the CEO of commodities giant GlencoreXstrata said the company would consider leaving Switzerland if the law passed. â€œI canâ€™t believe that Switzerland would cause such great harm to its economy,â€ Ivan Glasenberg said in an interview with the SonntagsZeitung. â€œAnd I say that not just as the head of a company, but as a Swiss citizen.â€ "I think it's quite arrogant of some people to think that big companies will disappear," Roth says of that criticism. "Big companies are not here because they can pay the managers high salaries. Big companies are in Switzerland because we create really good conditions for those companies. We have really well-educated people, we have a really good level of infrastructure, we have a health care system that is working, we have social security, and public security, of course, because of the social security. You are able to walk the streets â€” it doesn't matter how rich you are, you are safe here in Switzerland. Well-educated people, good infrastructure, that is the reason why these companies are here, not because they can pay those high salaries." There's a bigger question though. Anyone who's ever been to Switzerland knows that life is nice there; in a recent OECD poll, the country came in at the top for "life satisfaction." So why does Switzerland need to change? "In the past in Switzerland, it was usual that someone showed off their wealth," Roth says. "They had some modesty in Switzerland 30 years ago. Thirty years ago, there was a relation between the highest and the lowest salary â€” a relation of 1:6." For decades, Roth argues, as production rose in Switzerland, normal pay and executive pay rose in proportion, and that only changed 10-15 years ago. "So you see, it's really not Switzerland, this latest development." Whether Switzerland agrees is another matter. It's relatively rare for initiatives to pass, but recent polls have shown the yes and no votes are nearly tied, and Minder's "fat cat" initiative passed with 67.9% in March. "I'm optimistic," Roth says. "We have our chance. We're up against the big companies who spend millions. I can tell you that our opponents are nervous. I had a radio talk show before, and my opponent became a little aggressive. " "I think she's a bit nervous," he explains.
The American healthcare system sucks. We pay more for healthcare than any country in the world and we only getÂ average results. AndÂ tens of millions of Americans have no health insurance. Our latest attempt to address this situation, Obamacare, is a mind-numbing kluge of laws and policies that is off to a very rough start. And even if Obamacare ends up working, it will only fix part of the problem. The problem, as a ground-breaking article by Steve Brill made clear, is that America's healthcare providers and insurers treat people differently. If you're lucky enough to be included in a big insurance plan provided by a huge entity with a lot of negotiating leverage (such as the federal government), you pay low rates and low prices. If you're unfortunate enough to be in a high-risk group or not to be included in any plan, you pay sky-high prices. Or you get all your "healthcare" from the emergency room and, thus, lay the costs off on everyone else that way. The answer, as Brill's article also made clear, is a fully national health insurance system, in which all Americans are covered in the same massive group and for-profit insurers and healthcare providers can't pick and choose who to cover and how much to charge them. This system would effectively extend the current Medicare and Medicaid system to the whole population, and, in so doing, make it even more efficient. As in some other countries with national health insurance, Americans insured under this system would also be free to buy additional healthcare services, including additional private insurance. The system, in other words, wouldn't limit anyone's ability to pay for "premium" heathcare services if they chose to. But a lot of Americans still hate that idea. They have been told since birth that "national healthcare" is a disgrace. They have been brainwashed so thoroughly by America's vastly profitable medical industrial complex that their resistance to reality and change has become a religion. Anti-change advocates don't assess facts. They just claim, absurdly, that America currently has "the finest healthcare system in the world" and then cite horror stories about sick people dying in streets because they have to wait so long to get the (terrible) healthcare services available to them under "socialist" healthcare.Â  (This horror story, naturally, is presented as the polar opposite of our current system, In fact, in many ways, it's similar. Today, in America, many people without health insurance spend their lives waiting until they get so sick that they can go wait in emergency rooms. And then our often wildly profitable hospitals pay for their care by, effectively, sending their bills to everyone else.) Anyway, any American who is skeptical about national health insurance but has an open mind should read this testimonial from another American who is currently living in a country with national heath insurance â€” Britain. The American, Dawn Rutherford Marchant, lives in the UK with her family. She was recently asked on Quora to describe her life there. Amid this description (full answer here), she had the following to say about Britain's national healthcare system: AÂ massiveÂ advantage of living here is the National Health Service.Â  If an American could understand it, they would be amazed by its magnificence. Â  In this past week I have seen an ENT consultant surgeon and have had surgery scheduled in a few weeks' time.Â  There was no direct cost to me. Tonight my GP (family doctor) rang at 8pm to check in on another health issue.Â  She is chasing a consultant to authorise a new medication and will ring me back next week.Â  This did not cost me a penny. Â  So, three doctors and one medical procedure without a form to fill in or a bill to pay.Â  Pretty damn impressive stuff --yes, I know it is in our taxes but the system works well.Â  It is 'from birth to grave' care all woven together into one service -- ambulance to GP to hospital to nursing care.Â  There are all kinds of synergies created by such a system.Â  It is to be deeply respected, emulated, and not feared. The British National Health Service was created shortly after World War II, when everyone began to realize what a mess the system of private and municipal insurance was. It was a political challenge to get it passed â€” not surprisingly, those doing well under the status quo pushed back â€” but it passed. The NHS now costs the UK less than half as much per person as the U.S. system does. It is paid for with an ~11% tax. The contributions equate to about $3,000 a year per person. In addition to the National Health Service, the UK also has private insurers, which about 10% of the population choose to use. In other words, the British system has all the benefits we say we love so much â€” the ability to pay more for premium heathcare if we want it â€” and it also covers the basics for everyone in the country at half of our per-capita costs. Not bad!
Despite the ongoing anemic economic recovery, the stock market continues to clear new all-time highs. And this has come with much more chatter about an increasing risk of a stock market crash. But despite all of this talk, investors are just not buying it. According to Citi's Panic/Euphoria model, a weighted average of nine market indicators is sending a "clear warning sign of substantial complacency." According to the September reading of Yale's not-so-closely followed Crash Confidence Index, both individual and institutional investors don't see a crash coming within the next six months. In fact, this conviction is at its highest level since early 2007. Here's Yale regarding its Crash Confidence Index: Confidence that there will be no stock market crash in the succeeding six months generally declined (though with a lot of ups and downs) over the years since 1989 until the stock market bottomed out in late 2002. Just after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Crash Confidence actually rose a little. But Crash Confidence reached its lowest point at 20.79% for institutional investors and 28.95% for individual investors as of November 2002. Crash confidence reached its all-time low, both for individual and institutional investors, in early 2009, just months after the Lehman crisis, reflecting the turmoil in the credit markets and the strong depression fears generated by that event, and is plausibly related to the very low stock market valuations then. The recovery of crash confidence starting in 2009 mirrors the strong recovery in the stock market. None of this guarantees that a crash is coming. But this elevated level of complacency may explain at least some of the frothiness in the markets, and a reversal of sentiment could certainly exacerbate any selling.

Wikimedia CommonsA section of former Alternate US 71 near Carthage, Missouri.Falling gas prices have been a big boost for the economy. The national average price is sitting at around $3.21 per gallon. Prices are below $3 in just four states, according to GasBuddy.com. The cheapest state is Missouri at $2.908 per gallon. And within Missouri, according to CNBC's Carl Quintanilla, the cheapest place is Jasper County (home of Joplin). Why do they have it so good? Gas prices are determined by three main factors: the price of oil, the cost of transporting the fuel, and taxes. OIL The cost of West Texas Intermediate crude, the oil contract that trades in the U.S., has mostly been down all year, and now stands at about $94, thanks to the Great American Shale Boom. But because of a lack of infrastructure, only refineries closest to the country's oil production center — basically the mid-section of the country — have access to it. In fact, the lack of infrastructure has compounded a supply glut and driven WTI prices down further. That in turn produced an excess of gasoline stocks, which has helped keep mid-continent prices low. Oil refineries capture much of the cost savings from this discounted crude. But some savings do get passed on to consumers, AAA's Michael Green told us in an email. TRANSPORT Your next advantage comes based on your proximity to refineries, and the population density surrounding them. One of the country's largest concentrations of refineries happens to be within a few miles of Jasper County, and the region is relatively sparse, unlike areas surrounding mid-Atlantic refineries.  EIA  Jasper County also enjoys what is almost it's own personal gasoline pipeline offshoot, which further reduces transportation costs: PSU TAXES The final and perhaps most relevant price determinant is taxes. At $0.173/gallon, Missouri has the 5th-lowest gas tax in the country. For your information, Alaska has the lowest tax, followed by Wyoming, according to the Tax Foundation. New Jersey actually has the third-lowest gas tax, and the state's prices can often be as low as or lower than Missouri's (which never happens to N.J. neighbor Pennsylvania): GasBuddy Compare that with the whopping $0.506/gallon tax in New York. So, if you're desperate for cheap gas and if you think that premium for living in New York is overrated, then head to Jasper Co, Missouri.
AFPPresident Vladimir Putin visits a refinery of Russian oil giant Rosneft in the Black Sea port of Tuapse in southern Russia, on October 11, 2013. Russiaâ€™s failure to significantly change its energy-dependent economic model under President Vladimir Putin is consigning the country to potentially decades of low growth and eroding its status as a top emerging economy. The Russian economy ministry on Thursday dramatically confirmed what was obvious to many, by downgrading its estimate of Russiaâ€™s average growth to 2030 to a paltry 2.5 percent, a far cry from over seven percent rates in the early Putin years. "The pace of Russia's economic growth will fall behind the global average in the forecast period," admitted Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev. This year even Russia's official forecast puts 2013 growth at just 1.8 percent. But most worrying for the Kremlin is that the weakness cannot just be blamed on external factors but stems from domestic shortcomings. The Russian economy faces a daunting list of troubles â€“- a declining population, the re-emergence of the United States as a rival energy superpower due to shale gas, and the government's colossal spending on defence that stretches the budget. These factors are compounded by Russia's failure to stimulate private enterprise, reform the judicial system, improve labour productivity and turn the Russian economy into more than a lumbering energy producer. Russia's weakness this year alone can be linked to this failure, which has damaged the investment climate, economists say. The revisions by the economy ministry were the â€œclearest signal yet that Moscow believes that economic weakness over the past year has been structural rather than cyclical in nature,â€ said Neil Shearing, Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics. "Without a major shift in policy we suspect that Russia will go from being one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing economies to one of its biggest underperformers." The forecasts by his own ministry made Putinâ€™s aim of Russia becoming one of the worldâ€™s top five economies by 2020 look almost laughable and also undermined its credibility as a member of the BRICS groups of supposedly fast-growing emerging markets. An October survey of 21 top economists by Russiaâ€™s Higher School of Economics (HSE) showed not only a low consensus forecast of 1.6-percent growth this year, but also growth expectations of three percent or less for every year up to 2022. â€œThree percent growth, which would have seen unjustifiably low until recently now seems almost unreachable,â€ said Sergei Smirnov, deputy director of the HSEâ€™s Development Institute. He said that forecasts of "a decade of lean years" would mean growth of 29 percent in the decade from 2013-2022, making a mockery of the governmentâ€™s ambition to double GDP in 10 years. Russia's central bank, which has long kept a hawkish eye on inflation, on Friday warned about Russia's growth prospects after keeping key interest rates unchanged at 5.5 percent. "Due to weak investment activity and the slow recovery of external demand, the Central Bank expects low Russian economic growth rates to remain in the medium-term perspective," it said. The International Monetary Fund warned Russia in October that unless more was done to address reform, growth in the medium term would be no more than 3.5 percent due to Russiaâ€™s weak investment climate. But it said that Russia could achieve medium-term growth of 5.0 percent with reform. â€œUnder a reform scenario, Russiaâ€™s medium-term growth could rise considerably,â€ it said. Putin built his popularity on giving many Russians a new prosperity after the torrid 1990s. According to the IMF, this meant that since 2000 Russia has increased its per capita income from 33 to 51 percent of the OECD average. But Russia was helped in the period up to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis by two one-off factors â€“- unusually high oil prices and the using up of the spare capacity created by the dismantling of the inefficient Soviet economy. But this capacity has now been used up, with no slack. The IMF forecasts growth of just 1.5 percent in 2013 with a pick-up to three percent in 2014. Troublingly for the Kremlin, the IMF says the economy is working at close to full capacity with inflation and employment high. "The activation of spare capacity and rising oil prices that drove a decade of average annual growth in excess of five percent are not replicable," the IMF said in a report. With Putin set to stay in the Kremlin until at least 2018 â€“- and maybe even 2024 if he seeks another mandate â€“- the Russian authorities will want to ensure a maximum of economic stability to prevent handing a new cause to the still-nascent protest movement.

Fuse ChickenAnother Apple concept idea -- the iPhone AirApple is developing two new iPhones for release in 2014, Tim Culpan of Bloomberg reports, citing a "person familiar with the matter." The phones will reportedly have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens with curved glass. Both will be considerably larger than the current iPhone 5s, which feature 4-inch screens. The 5.5-inch screen would approach the size of Samsung's Galaxy Note, which is 5.7 inches. Apple is also developing new touch sensors that can distinguish different levels of pressure, Bloomberg reports. But these won't be ready in time for use with the new iPhones. The iPhone is by far Apple's most important and profitable product, and many iPhone users have been eagerly awaiting the company's launch of a larger screen. If the Bloomberg report is right, iPhone owners will finally get their wish next year, with two bigger sizes to choose from. And then there will apparently be this curved glass idea, which sounds significantly less beneficial.  Read the Bloomberg report here &gt; SEE ALSO: Check Out These Concept Photos Of A New "iPhone Air"
Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien has been cautious on the stock market in recent months. But for now, he thinks they may actually head a bit higher. "While the total return for the S&amp;P 500 was more than 16% in 2012 and has been 23% so far in 2013, I still believe there is further upside ahead, but a temporary correction from an overbought condition could occur at any time," wrote Wien this week. This is according to a piece he posted called 'A Portfolio for 2014', which looks at the US and international economies and where he expects them to go over the coming year.  Here's a brief summary of his outlook for the U.S.: ...I expect modest earnings increases and some multiple expansion from present levels, but I doubt that we will have another year of double-digit increases in the market indexes.  My view is that the industrialized nations are suffering from a lack of demand sufficient to absorb the abundant supply of quality goods produced by many countries across the world.  As a result unemployment is likely to remain high and capital spending, ordinarily contributing importantly to growth at this stage in the cycle, will remain low.  Operating rates in the U.S. are below 79%; capital spending picks up when they are in the mid-80%–90% range.  Consumer sentiment is likely to remain unenthusiastic in this environment, preventing retail sales from reaching a robust level.  A recent article in Barron’s quoting several academic studies pointed out that demographic factors (aging populations) and only slight increases in productivity will hold U.S. growth well below the 3½% of the post–World War II period, perhaps as low as 2%.  This will have both social and political implications, particularly with potentially growing entitlement expenditures putting pressure on the budget deficit. Internationally, Europe will grow modestly. It has slowly come out of its 2012 recession but growth will be "fragile". China’s GDP can be expected to grow at over 7%.  Japan will see growth between 1 to 2% and will finally start becoming inflationary thanks to Abenomics.  Here's how his portfolio looks in the coming year:  Read Wien's whole commentary at Blackstone.com.
Wikimedia CommonsAmerican financier J.P. Morgan is depicted as a bull, blowing soap bubbles for eager investors.Bubbles. They arise, in part, from the maddeningly rational human feeling that it makes sense to overpay a little today because, whatever, I'll just sell tomorrow! Or, put simply by Gawker's bubble-dabbler Hamilton Nolan, "Buy! Buy! Buy! Buy! High! High! High! High!" "Tech startups with no revenue have billion-dollar valuations," writes our Jim Edwards. "And engineers are demanding Tesla sports cars just to show up at work." There are, of course, tangible and empirical ways that economists determine bubblehood, but what fun is that?  Surely the best way to see if we're in a bubble is to take a look at the anecdotal ludicrous excess of today's exorbitantly wealthy.
RBC Capital MarketsThat tumbling blue line has been awesome for profit margins.Economists and financial market strategists continue to debate whether or not the current high corporate profit margins are sustainable. "I think margins may be peaking," chimed in Blackstone's Byron Wien this week. One of the most controversial sub-debates in the profit margin debate relates to low rates and how it affects interest expenses. Everyone acknowledges that much of the gains in net profit margins are attributable to record low borrowing rates. The profit margin bears argue that record low rates are not sustainable and that rising rates will inevitably reverse recent profitability gains. However, many market strategists think this is an oversimplistic way of considering the impact of rising rates.  They give two reasons. First, American companies have deleveraged their balance sheets after getting burned by the recent credit crisis. "[A]lthough we could see interest rates rise from current depressed levels, we would still expect them to remain well below history," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Dan Suzuki earlier this year. "We also do not see any rush for corporations to meaningfully re-lever their balance sheets for the foreseeable future." Second, American companies have locked in lower interest rates.  "The impact of higher rates should be muted, as companies have termed out their debt," said RBC Capital Markets' Jonathan Golub, who recently slapped a 2014 S&amp;P 500 target of 1,950 (on $119.00 EPS). In other words, companies have refinanced much of their debt in the same way consumers do. Many companies won't have to worry about seeing surging interest expenses until years after rates rise. Below is a chart from Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker showing the maturities of corporate debt. As you can see, it's not until 2016, 2017, and 2018 that we'll really have to worry about companies refinancing their liabilities.

AFPDemonstrators shout slogans during a protest against a gold mine project in Thessaloniki, Greece on 9 November, 2013 on the World Day of Action against gold mines.More than 5,000 people took to the streets of Greece's second-largest city on Saturday, police said, to protest against a controversial gold mine that has frayed relations in a northern village. Protesters carried a banner reading "Toxic dust doesn't have boundaries. No to gold mines" in Thessaloniki, while in Athens, 500 more gathered to shout slogans denouncing police brutality they allege was directed at those who have taken action against the mine. Opponents of the venture in Ierissos, a village on the tourist-friendly Halkidiki peninsula, believe it could poison groundwater supplies in the area. Violent resistance has broken out repeatedly since government permission to break ground on the project was granted in 2011 to Hellenic Gold, a Greek subsidiary of Canadian mining firm Eldorado Gold. In February militants threw Molotov cocktails at the site, wounding a guard and damaging equipment. This was followed two months later by the ransacking of the local police station in retaliation for what inhabitants saw as excessive force used in the arrest of two suspects connected with the previous attack. More than 200 people in the region around the mine are due in court on criminal charges connected with the demonstrations, leading to accusations that the authorities have criminalised the protest movement. Anti-mine activists claim it will poison local water supplies with mercury, lead and arsenic, but the government says the venture could create hundreds of jobs in a country with an unemployment rate of 27 percent.

AFPThe Philips logo on the company's office in Amsterdam.Back in 1978 in a boardroom near Lake Geneva, a bunch of nervous Philips inventors demonstrated a device that was to revolutionise the entertainment industry for the next three decades. Called the "Pinkeltje" after a small Dutch gnome in a children's story, the device performed flawlessly -- and so the world's first Compact Disc (CD) player was born. Thirty-five years later the Netherlands' Philips, once one of Europe's best-known brands for radios and televisions, is ditching the consumer electronics business that used to be its bread and butter, and is thriving. The Philips story is a business case of how a leading global industrial group, with leading technology, went through several rocky years of restructuring, and found a successful strategy to re-invent itself in time. Now the company is reaping the rewards of emerging from the restructuring cycle. In January, Philips announced the sale of its lifestyle entertainment branch, which makes stereos and DVD players, after selling its troubled TV-making arm in 2012. In February, Philips said it intended to drop the word "Electronics" from its name to indicate its shift in strategy. Faced with dwindling margins and fierce competition from Asia, the manufacturer born in southern Dutch city Eindhoven is refocusing on high-end health care, space-age lighting and the global explosion of a middle class interested in healthy living. This example of transformational strategy is working, analysts say. Profits are strong despite the recent financial and eurozone debt crises, and in a high-stakes roller-coaster climate for high-tech companies which has claimed high-flyers such as Nokia of Finland and BlackBerry of Canada. Last month, Philips announced that its third-quarter profits jumped almost three-fold from the equivalent 2012 figure ,to 282 million euros ($380 million) this year. The latest results were even driven by sales of household appliances in the emerging markets from whence came much of the new competition which threatened Philips. Marc Schauten, assistant finance professor at the Erasmus School of Economics in Rotterdam, said the company is doing well because "they made the shift into areas where they really have a competitive advantage." "Combined with the fact that they involve their clients (in development) and the reliability of their products they really have the cutting edge," he told AFP. At Theodoor Gilissen bank in Amsterdam, senior analyst Tom Muller said: "It was a tough choice for Philips to exit consumer electronics." He added: "This segment was one of its old pillars." But competition had become "murderous, with all kinds of Asian producers on the market," he told AFP. Even Asian giants such as Japan's Sony, Panasonic and Sharp have been undergoing major restructuring to keep up in the low-margin television business. Over the last two years Philips "has taken decisive steps to move away from low-growth, low-value businesses," the company's chief executive Frans van Houten said in London in September. The company is now focused on three segments: healthcare, lighting and consumer well-being. Nowhere is the shift in Philips more visible than in its healthcare division, which now accounts for about 43 percent of investments. Philips has seen a steady rise in full-year figures for its healthcare solutions, from 6.6 billion euros in sales in 2007 to a staggering 9.9 billion euros last year. From innovative operating theatres to remotely-monitored Intensive Care Units, Philips has clinched a series of mega-deals with hospitals around the world to provide medical equipment. Analysts draw another lesson from the case: Philips is constantly collaborating with smaller innovative companies, such as Israel's RealView Imaging to develop 3D holographic projections for surgeons. The system was used for the first time last month, bringing the world of sci-fi films into the reality of saving lives. Another lesson, in Philip's case, is to build on positions which have strong potential. Philips shipped its first lightbulb shortly after being founded in 1891 and the company today pins its hopes on innovative lighting ideas such as light-emitting diode (LED). As eco-friendly LED technology becomes more popular, lighting everything from hospital operating theatres to headlights on the latest cars, Philips expects to benefit: it owns most of the world's LED patents, thanks to years of research and development. The third prong of Philips' new strategy lies in consumer well-being products, including ingenious kitchen appliances to service humanity's growing obsession with healthy living. "We see a world with a growing middle class," CEO Van Houten said in his London presentation. Philips has been forced to make tough choices, but people such as Hans Mons, one of the original demonstrators of the "Pinkeltje" in 1978, is philosophical about the decision to drop consumer electronics. "Of course I'm nostalgic, but technology simply evolves, the whole world is changing. You have to change with it to stay in the competition," he said. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
In its latest monthly report, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's asset allocation team argues the U.S. stock market will be "at best flat over the coming few quarters, not forgetting risk of short-term correction." The firm expects the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to rise to 3.9% in 2014 (from the current level of 2.75%) as the Fed winds down its quantitative easing program, making stocks less attractive on a relative basis. DataStream, SG Cross Asset Research/Global Asset Allocation"With bond yields expected to rise, equities may suffer in a weak economic recovery regime," says SocGen's head of global asset allocation Alain Bokobza. "Rising bond yields during period of economic recovery are not necessarily bad for equities. However, at a time when earnings momentum remains weak and the consensus earnings growth estimate is expected to moderate, rising bond yields could be a catalyst for a U.S. equity market correction." In the report, the SocGen strategists break down the impact of rising bond yields on the stock market: Our methodology: For a given level of equity risk premium and 10-year government bond yield, we calculate the implied index level for U.S. equity market. We then compare the calculated index level with the current market level to calculate the implied upside for the equity market. For example, if U.S. 10-year government bond yield were to approach 3.5% and U.S. equity risk premium remained where it is now (4.65%), our model suggests the U.S. equity market could be 22% below its current level (see the table below). In our analysis, we keep all other parameters the same. Key conclusion â€“ Further S&amp;P 500 progression from current level is unlikely as U.S. government bond yields head higher in 2014. We expect U.S. government bond yields to approach 4% by Dec. 2014. At that level of yield, and with the normalisation of the risk premiums from rather cheap today (4.65%) to their long-term average (3.9%, which is an optimistic assumption), this would leave no room for U.S. equities to continue progressing after already five years of sustained equity index rise (+51% total return since the Lehman crisis). Potential for a near-term correction in U.S. equities canâ€™t be ruled out. The FED will eventually bring tapering back on the agenda in 2014. After all, does real GDP growth of 2.8% in the last quarter really deserve not only zero rates but also active monetary injection? Our analysis suggests that a U.S. government bond yield between 3% and 3.5% could trigger a correction of between -12% and -22% on the current ERP.

In October, SocGen turned bearish on U.S. stocks in a report titled "S&amp;P 500: -15% in sight, then the big sleep." "Strategically, we advise investors to switch into eurozone and Japanese equities, where economic policy is much clearer, monetary policy very loose and positioning is low," said Bokobza in the October report.
Raghuram KrishnamachariNEW YORK (AP) — A shooting at the ice rink of a popular midtown Manhattan park late Saturday sent two men to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Emergency crews responded to reports of a shooting at Bryant Park just after 11 p.m., officials said. One man was shot in the torso; the other in one of his legs and they were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center. "People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn't run," said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park's second-floor restaurant Celsius. Their table was next to a window overlooking the rink. "People were scared they didn't know what was going on," he said. Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay immobile on the rink. He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room. "We didn't know anything. The shooter could've been a lunatic with a machine gun," he said. Police said early Sunday they had no one in custody. The park, located in a bustling section of midtown Manhattan between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and near the New York Public Library, is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The ice skating rink, which is free to use, is open until midnight on the weekends. The park also features green space, restaurants and tables and chairs for public use. Joe Carella, a spokesman for Bryant Park Corporation, the not-for-profit company that privately manages the park, said the park is virtually crime free. A representative for Upsilon Ventures, the company that produces the Winter Village at Bryant Park, couldn't be reached. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.
