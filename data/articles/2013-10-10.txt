It's been an interesting night for markets. Just before 6:30 PM ET, the New York Times pushed a headline about how Obama had "rejected" the GOP's offer of a temporary debt ceiling raise. It turns out the truth was more complicated, and that negotiations are ongoing that could lead to a debt ceiling deal, and maybe even a deal to reopen the government. Also a poll came out right at 6:30 showing the government shutdown saga has been a catastrophe for the GOP, which also augurs well for a deal. So markets have recovered. US futures have erased their losses, and Japan is surging. Here's the Nikkei Nikkei.com
APAfter an hour-long meeting, President Barack Obama and Republicans failed to agree on a plan that would extend the nation's debt limit for a six-week period. The New York Times initially reported†that Obama had rejected Republicans' offer of a clean, six-week debt ceiling increase because it didn't address the government shutdown. But both the White House and House leaders took a more optimistic tone. Both sides pledged to work throughout the night to complete a deal. "No final decisions were made; however, it was a useful and productive conversation," House Republicans said in a joint statement.  "The President and leaders agreed that communication should continue throughout the night. House Republicans remain committed to good faith negotiations with the president, and we are pleased there was an opportunity to sit down and begin a constructive dialogue tonight." House Republican leaders had unveiled a plan to†extend the nation's borrowing authority for six weeks on Thursday, provided that Obama and Democrats enter into negotiations about broader fiscal issues. But their plan does not end the ongoing government shutdown ó something the White House said would be necessary for negotiations. Prior to the meeting between Obama and the Republican leaders, Senate Majority Harry Reid said that negotiations among the parties before the government shutdown ended was "not going to happen." Republicans left the White House without making comments to reporters Thursday night. Once back on Capitol Hill, they reportedly did not look happy. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters, however, that the talks were "constructive" and that they would continue Thursday evening. "The president didnít say yes, didnít say no. Weíre continuing to negotiate this evening," Rep. Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, told reporters. The White House characterized the meeting as "good," but said that no specific determinations about a path forward were made.† The full readout from the White House: The President had a good meeting with members of the House Republican Leadership this evening; the meeting lasted approximately an hour and a half.† The President, along with the Vice President, Treasury Secretary Lew, Denis McDonough and Rob Nabors listened to the Republicans present their proposal.† After a discussion about potential paths forward, no specific determination was made.† The President looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle.† The Presidentís goal remains to ensure we pay the bills weíve incurred, reopen the government and get back to the business of growing the economy, creating jobs and strengthening the middle class. †† The†meeting†among Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and 18 House Republican leaders lasted more than an hour, the White House said.

The story is developing. S&amp;P 500 futures immediately dropped by nearly 10 points on the headline. All of this follows a meeting that the GOP leadership held with Obama. Markets exploded higher during the cash trading session with the Dow closing up 323 points on news of the potential deal. "I would hope the president would view this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway," House Speaker John Boehner said today. Here's a look at S&amp;P 500 futures after the headline crossed: FinViz
This is not what the U.S. nuclear industry needed. We now¬†appear to be running out of an essential compound needed to cool fission in the most common type of nuclear generator, according to a General Accounting Office report. The news comes as American utilities will have mothballed at least five nuclear power plants in 2013 due to lower natural gas prices and runaway operation costs. ¬†¬† Lithium-7 is used to filter out acidity and contaminants in a pressured water nuclear plant's coolant. Here's the diagram. GAO We used to produce our own lithium-7. But doing so is really bad for workers' health, so we stopped in the '60s. Since then we've basically relied on the Russians and the Chinese to supply us. They harvest it as a byproduct from making nuclear weapons. But according to GAO, we now barely have enough lithium-7 to meet our current demand, and definitely not enough to add more nuclear generating capacity if we ever wanted to. "...little is known about the lithium-7 production capabilities of China and Russia and whether they will be able to provide future supplies. China and Russia produce lithium-7 as a by-product of enriching lithium-6 for their nuclear weapons programs, according to a DOE official, much like the United States¬†previously did. Because of the secrecy of their weapons programs, China and Russia‚Äôs lithium-7 production capabilities are not fully known, according to lithium-7 brokers." And the supply risk out of both countries is only going to increase. China will need to begin keeping its own lithium-7 for the 25 new nuclear plants its scheduled to open by 2015. And a lithium-7 broker to GAO staff that for reasons that remain unclear, he was now having trouble finding Russian manufacturers. The agency outlines three options to address the situation: start aggressively sourcing and stockpiling lithium-7, restarting domestic production of it, or start transitioning reactors away from it. The first one would be resisted by whatever manufacturers are left as it would tank prices, and the other two would be insanely expensive.¬† So the bottom line is this: "The risk of relying on so few producers of lithium-7 leaves the 65 pressurized water reactors in the United States vulnerable to supply disruptions."
AP Russia's dramatic path from communism to capitalism has resulted in an unprecedented rise in inequality, according to the latest Credit Suisse Wealth Report. The country is unique in that 110 billionaires hold 35% of the country's wealth, the report says, meaning that the country has the highest rate of wealth inequality in the world (baring small Carribean islands with resident billionaires). ìThe situation in Russia has no parallel," Anthony Shorrocks of Global Economic Perspectives Ltd, one of the report's authors, told the Wall Street Journal. "If you look at how Russians have made their money and the sort of political ties that seem to be necessary to maintain it, there are just very few places where the situation is similar." Okay, let's put it in perspective. Russia has 143 million people, of which only 110 are billionaires, according to Forbes. Now, according to Credit Suisse, the total wealth of the Russian nation is $1.2 trillion. If Russian billionaires have 35% of that figure, their combined wealth should be around $420 billion. There's something a little off about that, clearly. Worse still, from Credit Suisse's data, there appears to be very little "trickle down" wealth in Russia. 93.7% of Russiaís adult population have less than $10,000 in wealth, according to the report. Here's how Russia's population is divided by wealth: Adam Taylor / Business Insider / Credit Suisse Wealth Report (N.b. The sliver that should show those with over $1 million in wealth is so small that it cannot be shown in this chart). For some perspective, here's a chart showing the same data from the United States. Now, remember, the United States isn't considered the most equal nation on Earth, but this certainly looks a lot healthier: †Adam Taylor / Business Insider / Credit Suisse Wealth Report Of course, there are some pretty big caveats here. Credit Suisse themselves point out that Russia's wealth data may be inaccurate due to a lack of data on the value of non-financial assets, and Leonid Bershidsky of Bloomberg goes a little further to pointing out why "measuring wealth is an immensely complicated business," especially in Russia, where property data is not included in wealth figures (Credit Suisse was forced to "estimate" real assets"). Additionally, inequality is often measured by income data, which is more easily obtained and leads to some interesting results ó at least one measure of income inequality suggests that Russia is more equal than the U.S. Whether it's a better measure than wealth is certainly a matter for debate, however. Wealth accumulates over time, and high earners can save it ó and pay more to keep it.
REUTERS/Jo Yong-HakThe Goldman Sachs research team has released its report on¬†dividend and buyback investment strategies. "S&amp;P 500 companies are buying back more than 3% of market cap, 2x the pace from the 1990s, and dividends are up 50% since 2010," writes Goldman economist Stuart Kaiser. "80% of S&amp;P 500 is buying back stock. We expect 10% buyback and dividend growth in 2014." Strong corporate balance sheets, low bond yields, and low U.S. economic growth has meant that investors want companies to return more cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, Kaiser notes. And over the last 20 years, S&amp;P 500 companies with robust buyback programs have outperformed the market. Kaiser picks out 23 top S&amp;P 500 stocks organized by total yield.
The federal budget should always be scrutinized and pruned outside of a recessionary period, in our opinion. Future budget discussions remain important to the financial markets, and to the path of the US economy‚Äôs growth. Despite our concerns about future spending patterns, we do find it curious that few elected officials have mentioned that the budget deficit has cyclically shrunk from over 10% of GDP to roughly 4.3% of GDP. However, budget issues and future spending are different issues from defaulting on the debt that pays for past outlays incurred by administrations from both parties. Although political rhetoric might suggest otherwise, one must recognize that no country or company has ever received a cheaper cost of capital after a debt default. The notion that a default might be good is in no way based on empirical evidence, and it seems quite misleading to imply otherwise. Auto insurance seems to provide an appropriate analogy to the situation now faced in Washington. Suppose one has an impeccable driving record, but unfortunately one day gets into an auto accident. Will the auto insurance company raise or lower one‚Äôs insurance rates? Of course, the insurance company will raise the premium. One doesn‚Äôt know how much the insurance premium will go up, but one can be fully certain that it will not go down. Defaulting on the debt provides a similar range of outcomes. If the US defaults on our debt, one really doesn‚Äôt know how much the US will be penalized in the financial markets, but one can be quite certain that the US will not be rewarded. One doesn‚Äôt know how large the penalty will be, but our cost of capital will undoubtedly increase. We are not sure that the apocalyptical forecasts need come true. That seems as extreme to us as do the forecasts that there will be a beneficial outcome. However, just as in the auto insurance example, all outcomes are negatively skewed. Elected officials often talk about placing unfair burdens on future generations. Defaulting on the debt has the potential to significantly burden future generations with a structurally higher cost of capital. Despite that we don‚Äôt know how large the burden would be, one has to recognize that default will necessarily result in a burden on future generations. Although one can‚Äôt assess how negative a default would be, it is critically important to realize that, just as in our insurance example, there is no possible positive outcome associated with default.

Advisors That Are Only Focused On Asset Allocation Are The Real Dinosaurs Of Wealth Management (The Wall Street Journal)  "The real dinosaurs of wealth management are the ones who drone on and on about asset allocation," writes Norb Vonnegut in the Wall Street Journal. He doesn't think investors want advisors that will just diversify their portfolios. Stock and fixed-income ETFs have made this relatively easy. Meanwhile, investors can turn to lawyers and accountants for estate planning and tax strategies.¬† "From what I saw, advisers were more terrified than clients in the crash. How do you reassure clients about their portfolios when you are wondering whether your company will go belly up? When your deferred stock and net worth are tanking, thanks to the toxic waste that some monkey cooked up in another division?¬† "‚Ä¶In today's world of asset allocation, this means immersing ourselves in the markets, soaking up all the research, listening to the talking heads, and taking a stance on individual stocks and bonds. It means keeping our heads down even when it's more fun to gossip about who did what during happy hour Thursday night." Financial Services Firm TIAA-CREF Is Hiring 200 Advisors (Investment News) TIAA-CREF, a money manager that also provides pension plans to nonprofits, plans to hire 200 advisors by the end of 2014, according to Investment News.

Some Stock Market Investors Find This Chart Troubling (Jefferies) The S&amp;P 500 is hovering close to its September 18 all-time high of 1,729. But Sean Darby at Jefferies points out that the number of S&amp;P 500 companies hitting a new all-time high is much lower than in previous rallies. Jefferies Any Hope Of A Rally In Q4 Is Out The Window (Societe Generale) Stocks have rallied on news that we might see a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. But Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale global strategist Kit Juckes thinks this will end up being negative for risk assets.¬† "There are an awful lot of cross-currents in markets at the moment," wrote Juckes in a note to clients this morning. "The U.S. political protagonists are talking again and Yellen‚Äôs nomination has been well received. Equities, credit and EM assets are all holding up reasonably well, despite upward pressure on U.S. yields amid reports of higher 'haircuts' on T-Bills as concerns grow about whether the debt ceiling can be increased before coupon payments are due. The result is that holding on to positions is harder." But the problem is that this 'deal' is only a temporary fix that doesn't resolve "underlying issues." In that case, "any hope of Q4 risk rally taking hold will be out of the window."
On October 17, the U.S. will hit the debt ceiling, which means the government will no longer be able to borrow money by issuing bonds. From there, the Treasury will rapidly run out of cash as it pays its obligations. Experts agree that this could lead to the worst-case scenario of a default. However, many sharp-minded finance folks have floated some non-traditional ways around the debt. Ideas include minting a trillion dollar coin or issuing premium Treasury bonds. The analysts at Credit Suisse think that the U.S. could actually start selling its gold reserves to raise cash. Here's The Financialist's Ashley Kindergan: There are less obvious solutions, too. For one, the Treasury could take steps to sell the country‚Äôs gold reserves. Former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner rejected that tack in 2011 because it would send a signal of absolute dysfunction to financial markets. But as Credit Suisse pointed out in its interest rate strategy note last week, ‚Äúfaced with a choice to either fail to pay someone or to liquidate gold holdings and make everyone whole, Secretary Lew could conceivably argue that it is in the best interest of the public to sell gold in order to avoid jeopardizing the United States‚Äô credit.‚Äù At this point, it looks like the debt ceiling may be delayed for another six weeks.
JP Morgan will kick off earnings season for Wall Street banks tomorrow with an announcement at 7:00 am EST followed by a call at 8:30 am. Analysts are expecting earnings per share to come in at $1.29, down from $1.60 in Q2, and revenue of $23.6 billion, down from $25.1 billion in Q2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No surprise that analysts are expecting a decline in revenue and EPS. As we've heard over and over again, JP Morgan is spending a lot of money on its legal troubles. The bank has said it will put aside an additional $1.5 billion in its legal reserves. What observers will be wondering is ‚Äî is $1.5 billion enough, and when will this regulatory beat down be over? Another question on everyone's mind, according to Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones, will be about JP Morgan's mortgage business. "We'll be looking at mortgage banking results closely," Stemm told Business Insider via e-mail. "While a drop in refinancing activity has been telegraphed and is expected, we'll be interested in any growth in new purchase activity as well as management's commentary around housing market health in general. We'll also be interested in how significantly gain on sale margins compress from recently elevated levels... Additionally, we'll look to other fee-based businesses, such as custody banking and asset management, as a potential sources to offset weakness in mortgage banking and/or overall sluggishness in net interest income." Lastly ‚Äî and this goes for every bank,‚Äî expect a eyes on fixed income, currency and commodity trading. Banks that have reported their numbers so far, like Jefferies and Deutsche Bank, have gotten hit hard. JP Morgan could be no different. We'll find out tomorrow bright and early.

BCA Research via Paul KedroskyThe three charts at right (the first two produced by Ben Rabidoux, the third by BCA Research) are a bit worrisome. They present three ways of looking at what is arguably a much larger housing bubble in Canada (relative to the size of its economy) than the one that eventually brought down the United States economy a few years ago. It's unclear at what point this becomes a problem for Canada, however. Recent data have been fairly strong. "September sales data suggest the wheels of the Canadian housing market are leaving the tarmac after a brief layover," said BMO chief economist Douglas Porter in a recent note to clients. "September resale transactions surged 64% y/y in Vancouver, 30% in Toronto, 19% in Calgary and 9% in Edmonton. True, sales a year ago were depressed by stricter mortgage rules, but the level of activity is far from weak, with Toronto posting the third best September in the past ten years and 8% above the mean, while Vancouver sales are only 7% below normal for the month ... With interest rates apparently again stuck in a holding pattern, it could well be blue skies ahead for this flight." Nonetheless, we can't help but agree with Paul Kedrosky, who alerted us to these charts in a tweet, that they are particularly "eye-popping."

REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueU.S. President Barack Obama smiles as he arrives to speak to workers at the Alcoa Davenport Works Factory in Bettendorf, Iowa, June 28, 2011. Markets are surging today. The Dow is up 300 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up 35 points. Both rallies represent 2.1% gains for the day. "It looks like House Republicans are preparing to move a short-term debt ceiling increase that would provide a framework for negotiations with President Barack Obama," reported BI's Brett Logiurato. House Speaker John Boehner is expected to seek support for a six-week extension to the debt ceiling. This news has been crushing Treasury bills. The impending October 17 debt ceiling and potential default by the U.S. was arguably the biggest near-term uncertainty to the markets. ¬†
Stocks are surging today, and the S&amp;P 500 isn't too far from its September 18 all-time high of 1,729. But of all of the warning signs skeptics point to, this is one of the more unusual ones. From Jefferies' Sean Darby, this chart show the number of S&amp;P 500 companies hitting a new all-time high on a given day. "Judging from previous rallies, there have been much fewer companies posting new highs lately," said Darby. Unfortunately, this chart doesn't track the number of stocks that are trading just below their highs. Jefferies
AP It looks like the House of Representatives may pass a short-term extension of the debt ceiling but not address the ongoing government shutdown. This might mean a perverse outcome†ó a government shutdown that lasts longer because the prospect of a payments crisis is delayed. And that means that the negative effects of a government shutdown are likely to build. A lot of government agencies have an ability to paper over a short-term shutdown ó for example, by relying on extra funds they had left over from the previous year. The longer the shutdown goes on, the less workable that approach will be. Here are a few ways in which the shutdown will keep getting worse if it goes on for several more weeks. Federal courts. So far they have stayed open during the shutdown, essentially by searching under the couch cushions for money. Federal courts have announced that they can stay open until Oct. 17 or 18 by using a combination of fee-income and previous appropriations not tied to a specific fiscal year. After that, they'll have to close, stalling any federal trials. WIC. Unlike most means-tested entitlement programs, the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides nutritional assistance to pregnant women and newborn babies, is funded through the discretionary budget. That means it gets no money if the government is shut down. So far, it's been able to operate by using reserve funds, and the Department of Agriculture has said it will be able to do so through October. The future after that is uncertain. Federal workers. "Essential workers" ó well over a million of them ó have to keep working during the shutdown. They'll eventually be paid for their work, but the government can't actually issue them paychecks until the shutdown ends. In most cases, that's been an academic issue so far, since we haven't had a scheduled pay day for most federal workers during the shutdown. That will change Friday, when many "essential" federal workers will only get 60% of their normal paycheck for the work period that ended on Oct. 4. Four of the 10 business days in that pay period fell in October, during the shutdown. Other federal workers are supposed to be paid on Tuesday, Oct. 15 and will get a similarly short paycheck. And if the government is still shut down by the time the next pay day rolls around near the end of October, these workers won't get any paychecks at all. Amtrak.†Amtrak has said, vaguely, that it will be able to continue operating in a "short-term" government shutdown and that it could continue normal operations for "weeks."†But it's not clear how long a company that lost $1.2 billion last year and relies on heavy subsidies by the Department of Transportation can keep running fully operational. Mortgage-loan approvals.†A lengthy federal government shutdown could also disrupt the housing market ó particularly with large-scale mortgage approvals. According to CNBC,†so-called "jumbo loans" (mortgages with values exceeding $417,000) are becoming more complicated. Many lenders won't approve "jumbo loans" without getting tax verification from the IRS, a process that has been halted because of the shutdown. Even if they are approving the loans, all of the lenders will have to obtain that tax information from the IRS, which makes the loan inherently riskier. The IRS' absent tax-verification processing has also affected, for example,†credit-card seekers and small business owners applying for loans.
REUTERS/Mark BlinchNIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario ‚Äî The BlackBerry, created in¬†Canada¬†in the 1980s, jump-started a sort of Silicon Valley here, where young computer engineers flocked to participate in the next best thing. It gave consumers across the US-Canada border and around the globe the first glimpse into where an untethered phone, connected to the web, could take you. It also demonstrated that the leader in any industry is only as good as its innovations and the vigilant creativity of its management, whether they come from Canada or anywhere else. Even so, it‚Äôs hard to understand why Canadians are weeping quite so much over the demise of BlackBerry, which recently¬†announced¬†a quarterly loss of almost $1 billion and plans to lay off 40 percent of its workers. If you live in a place like Pittsburgh ‚Äî the once-mighty steel capital now with an economy built on education and health care ‚Äî you understand that the mightiest and most innovative companies can fail. Canada‚Äôs best hope to start and hold the technological lead for wireless phones is in decline. Newer technologies leapfrog older ones; customers want the newest and shiniest technologies. Marketing matters, and time does not stand still for any post-internet innovation. However, a recent trip to Canada reminded me that the orientation of the US neighbor to the north is different from¬†Americans'. In terms of population, Canada is a small country ‚Äî tiny, really ‚Äî and it has a melancholy allegiance to companies that started in places like Waterloo, Ontario, where the BlackBerry is made. It wants to compete with the US and clings to the notion that Canadians should support a sort of industrial nationalism. If national health care works and everyone is on board, why not expect Canadians to mourn the passing of one of its last best ideas? Or at least buy a BlackBerry? Canadians bemoan the popularity of the iPhone. They recall the day Steve Jobs, a marketing genius, stepped onto a stage in jeans and black turtleneck holding the most remarkable of wireless devices, with killer apps to come. He said it was five years ahead of any other mobile phone and would use the ultimate pointing device, our fingers, ‚Äúto create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.‚Äù The iPhone became the new standard. Competitors hustled to emulate it and, using the new Android technology, introduced mobile phones that could do many of the same tricks. By comparison, BlackBerry‚Äôs tiny keyboard and screen ‚Äî and its embarrassing lack of apps ‚Äî made it seem out of date. There was no Blackberry store then, and the race to keep up was quickly lost by slow rollouts, bugs in new products, and unresponsive management. Research in Motion, as the company was known then, went from being the pioneer of the technology that led to an explosion in smartphones to being cut from the action, losing $965 million in the second quarter this year. The company cut 4,500 jobs this fall. This is hard for Canadians to believe because, starting in 2003, the BlackBerry was the phone to have. The Queen had one. Obama could not stop using his. It was secure and cool. People who carried one were considered ahead of the curve. Companies bought millions, giving them to employees to email, browse the web, and make phone calls securely. Canadians now are facingthe reality that the country‚Äôs most valuable company in being bought for $4.7 billion by the Canadian version of Warren Buffett, Prem Watsa of Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. in Toronto. That company already owns 10 percent of BlackBerry. This development has given Canadians plenty to worry about. Will their landmark innovation be viewed as a complete failure, in a scenario where the stock plunged but the top executives prospered? Will hundreds more workers in Waterloo lose their jobs? Will Canadians be left, once again, to follow the tastes and inclinations of a huge US market driven by flashy, incremental rollouts of the iPhone, now available in a range of colors? Canadians should learn the lessons of BlackBerry‚Äôs death. It was killed by the very force it once rode: change is disruptive and recognizes no international borders.
REUTERS/ Pascal LauenerGoldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd BlankfeinGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein finally revealed what he does during the weekends, in a new video posted by the investment bank. During a discussion with the summer analyst class, one of the London-based interns pointed out that Blankfein had said he likes to read a lot of biographies and many of these books tend to discuss the subjects daily habits.¬† So the intern asked Blankfein to spill about what he does on the weekends.¬† Blankfein told the group that he's constantly traveling around the world and reading massive briefing books along the way. He also has to take a lot of calls and answer emails throughout the weekend. ¬† As for his social life, a lot of his friends tend to be other industry leaders.¬† Sometimes, though, he prays for rainy days so he can just chill on the couch.¬† It sounds pretty intense, but that's probably part of the job.¬† Here's Blankfein:¬† "This job is pretty consuming. Last week, I mean I don't want to tell my sad story to you. But last week I was in China, since I was so close I stopped in on Sydney on the way back, which is only 11 hours away in the wrong direction. So I spend a lot of time at this and on Saturday I go to Europe again. When I'm on the plane, you think I'm reading all those...See, people say things that are different from what they do. I tell you how I like to read this stuff. But I'll tell you when I'm on the plane I'm reading my notes for the meetings I'm going to have. "If you look at what I do, I go out I like to run and laugh and jump with the other boys and girls and play golf and do all those things and talk to my kids and lie on the couch. Sometimes I pray for a rainy day so I don't feel guilty about lying on the couch is what I really want to do. "But come Sunday, which it may be depending on the time of the year, the football game will be on or I'm doing it in the morning or the early evening I'm living my next week. I get big briefing books over the weekend with the meetings that I have and notes on it and who they are and they may expect that I know something and I will and I do. There's consequence. It's not just window dressing. I'll get caught up. But that takes time. ¬†And I can't do that five minutes before I'm scheduled to see somebody because my day goes blump, blump, blump...So on Sunday I go through my week and I remind myself during the week..."¬† "Also, the weekend and off time is the time when people sort of like lining up for approvals. Everyone knows there's a lot of processes, commitments, committee.... ¬†Let me tell you, those committees are the last step in the long process because there's a lot of trial balloon and testing and socializing some things. So if somebody has a kind of a hairy situation or a context of whether they're worried we should do this or not or whether if will get approved or not, you're working on that long memo now at this stage in your career. In the course of that memo evolving, people are testing and trying out ideas. That happens a lot on the weekends. There's a lot of voicemail traffic back in forth. ¬†"I'm thinking of doing this in this country with these people. This is a little sketchy because of this. We're taking a risk here. The client really wants us to do that. I'm not so sure. What should we advise? What business election? Should we choose this client or that client to represent in an auction? you know etc."¬†Those things get socialized. Now that's just a word...Means there's a lot of conversation and dialogue. And that's not like that's what you're doing. You're doing other things at the same time. While you're out and about, the phone rings and someone is running something by you and you're sort of saying well you're not giving a final answer this kind based on what you're saying this is how I'm leaning this is what I'd think. ¬†They go away and develop the facts more. They go out and you tell them they better adjust the facts... That's also a process that's always happening in this firm. That's kind of a gray background noise of stuff that's going on in the firm away from the crisp decision making process you observe and that you prepare for... "¬† "There's another element where you get to me my age and you personal and business life kind of converge. So that you can't be doing what I'm doing and engaging with other business leaders without becoming friends.

Allen StanfordWhen 18,000 people got fleeced in Allen Stanfordís $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme,†the court appointed a†receiver†in 2009 to recover as much money as possible from Stanfordís failed companies to return to investors. After four-and-a-half years, the receiver, Ralph Janvey, began mailing checks ranging from $2.81 to $110,000 to hundreds of investors. That amounts to about $55 million of the $6 billion lost in the scheme, less than a penny on the dollar. Unlike the investors, Janvey, who has billed from $340 to $400 an hour for his services, is making out quite well. To date, Janvey and his team have recovered $234.9 million from the bankrupt Stanford Financial Group and spent more than half the total ó approximately $124 million ó on personnel and other expenses. ìFrom the†victimsí†point of view there is no way, shape or form that the receivership could be viewed as successful,î said Angela Kogutt, whose extended family lost a total of $4.9 million investing with Stanford. ìThis has been one of the biggest failures of a liquidation in history.î The largest chunk of the Janvey teamís expenses ñ $67.1 million ó was spent on ìreceivershipís professional fees and expenses,î according to court documents. Those fees and expenses add up to more than 28.5 percent of the money recovered from Stanfordís assets so far. -------------------------<U+2028>Donít miss a single Center for Public Integrity investigation on the financial industry.†<U+2028>Sign up now to receive special newsletters†relevant to your interest.<U+2028>------------------------- Janvey has ìcomplete and exclusive control, possession, and custodyî of the assets left behind by Stanfordís business, according to the court order that named him receiver on Feb. 17, 2009. Janveyís attorney, Kevin Sadler of Houston law firm Baker Botts, said the high costs are an unfortunate downside of unwinding Allen Stanfordís 18-yearfinancial house of cards, which had offices in 23 states and 13 countries and more than 3,000 employees. Worldwide tug of war Sadler said Janvey has been fighting a ìworldwide tug of war over what was left of Stanfordís assets,î involving multiple national governments and liquidators in Antigua where Stanford International Bank was located. In March, Janvey reached a settlement to recover about $300 million worth of Stanfordís assets that have been frozen in Switzerland, Canada and the United Kingdom. Sadler said such lawsuits are now the best hope for getting more money back for Stanfordís victims. Janvey has been enmeshed in controversy regarding the Stanford liquidation. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which nominated Janvey and rarely has public disputes with receivers, won a motion to rein in some of his spending in June 2009 after the first fee applications were submitted. The expenses included† a $160,000 payment to a public relations firm called Pierpont Communications for three months of reviewing, sorting and forwarding emails in 2009. In a written objection to the fee application, court-appointed examiner, John Little, said he had ìsignificant doubt that Pierpont has created any benefit for the Receivership Estate.î FTI Consulting ó a forensic accounting firm ó billed more than $528,000 in airfare, parking, hotels, taxi, and subway costs to the estate for its first 56 days on the job. Little objected, pointing out that this amounted to ì$9,439 in travel-related expenses per day, every day, during the first 56 days.î A large part of the receivershipís early spending -- $48 million ñ went to winding down the more than 100 companies in the Stanford Group, costs that were unavoidable, Sadler says. Today, Little says Janveyís spending has slowed.† In the 12 months ended June 30, heís spent $9.1 million, compared to $20 million spent in the first two months of the receivership in 2009. U.S. District Judge David C. Godbey denied a 2011 request by unhappy investors to intervene in the case because they believed Janvey was spending too much money.† Godbey noted that ìthe rate of expenditures on professional fees has decreased markedly over time, with the bulk of such expenses incurred relatively early in the receivership.î Guaranteed income When large Ponzi schemes or companies go bankrupt, court-appointed receivers often find themselves employed for long stretches of time with a guaranteed income. There are no clear rules or guidelines dictating how a receiver should go about unwinding a failed or fraudulent business or recovering its assets, Sadler said. That allows receivers like Janvey to work full-time for years on an estate, billing either investors or the congressionally chartered Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Allen Stanfordís $7 billion scam was just one of many Ponzi schemes to fall apart within the past five years. Most notably, Bernard Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for operating a $50 billion Ponzi scheme that cost investors more than $17 billion. Irving Picard, the†Madoff receiver†who was appointed in December 2008, says he has spent about $850 million trying to recover money for investors. The number is huge but itís less than 10 percent of the $9.5 billion heís returned to Madoffís victims.† Heís distributed $4.9 billion. He declined to say whether he believes Janveyís costs are too high. ìI donít know enough about the specifics about what he had to do,î Picard said in an interview. Like Janvey, Picard kept Madoffís firm open to determine whether he should sell it before winding it down, and he paid all the employees for a short period. ìYou donít jump in and automatically say. ëBoom, youíre gone,íî he said. ìAnd by the way, it was Christmastime. Youíve got to look at that.î Picard has also sued hundreds of people and is working in more than 20 countries to recover money. As he describes his work, Picard speaks repeatedly about the cost-benefit analyses he makes for each decision. ìYou do it for every decision,î he said. ìAnd then perhaps you drop it.î Sadler said Madoffís scheme was a ìcompact operation to wind downî in comparison to Stanfordís, which involved more than 100 different interconnected companies.<U+2028><U+2028> Like Picard, he said, Janvey watches his costs.ìWeíve been pretty sensitive to the fact that we canít spend $10 to recover $10 ó or even $5,î he said. Suing the employees Janvey has†sued about 1,800 former Stanford employees and customers whom he says got money from the company ó either in salary, bonuses or investment returns ó that rightfully belongs to the defrauded investors. ìEveryone we have sued, we have sued because in both fact and law we believe they received money they were not entitled to,î Sadler said. He said the total amount Janvey could recover from these lawsuits is $1 billion, the only remaining source of money for the defrauded investors. Most of the former employees and clients are fighting the suits because they believe they only got money they were entitled to. Susan Jurica was a fixed-income portfolio manager at the company. In 2008, about a year before the SEC shut down the company, her entire team was let go. Jurica took a lump sum severance of $50,000 rather than opt for monthly payments. When Janvey took over, she says, he looked for any person who got a payment of $50,000 or more and went after the money on behalf of investors. At the heart of the fraud were certificates of deposit that were sold to victims, which Jurica says she did not profit from. ìI was very surprised that they had the gall to try to tell us that we were being paid with proceeds from CDs,î Jurica said in an interview. ìWe never bought any of the Stanford CDs.î Jurica is still fighting the lawsuit in a Texas court. Janvey has sued thousands of people but he has forgone many lawsuits because the return wasnít worth it. For example, Janvey sued the Democratic and Republican national party committees to recover Stanfordís contributions. He also sent letters to the more than 50 senators and House members who received Stanford contributions but did not go to court. Fewer than 20 returned the money, he said. Picardís fees are not taken directly out of the estate, but are paid off by†the SIPC†at a 10 percent discount off his usual rate. Janvey, on the other hand, is paid directly by the estate at a 20 percent discount because the Stanford case was turned down by the SIPC. The SEC sued SIPC over the decision not to protect Stanford investors, but lost. It will appeal that decision this fall. The SIPC said it does not cover the Stanford investors because the Securities Investor Protection Act ìdoes not authorize SIPC to protect monies invested with offshore banks or other firms that are not SIPC members. The Act also does not protect investors against a loss in value of a security, including because of mismanagement or fraud,î according to its website. Another receivership backed by SIPC was the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy. The expenses billed by the receiver in that case, James W. Giddens, including administrative, professional, consulting and operational costs total more than $1.8 billion since the filing date in 2008, according to court documents. The returns have been big. ìCustomer distributions will exceed $105 billion, by far the largest customer distribution in history,î Giddensí ninth interim report states. Janvey has been widely criticized for spending too much, but Sadler insists itís the only way to resolve a major fraud. ìWhen these things collapse, they just cost a lot of money to clean up,î he said. Meanwhile, Stanfordís investors are still waiting. John Wade of Covington, La., was looking to sell his business and retire when he started doing business with Stanford. The veterinarian and his partner decided to invest $2.5 million in pension funds and personal savings with a Stanford Financial Group financial advisor as they prepared to put their business, which provides microchip IDs for pets, on the block. ìWe worked hard for many years and put money away.† It was time,î Wade said, ìI had just bought a boat and a guitar and I was off to go fishing.î Instead, seven years later, Wade is ìjust trying to rebuild the retirement nest egg.î The Center for Public Integrity is a non-profit, independent investigative news outlet.

APPresident Barack Obama's approval rating dropped a point in Thursday's three-day rolling Gallup average. And Gallup's Economic Confidence Index held steady at -35, which is still at its worst levels since late 2011. Obama's approval rating fell a point to 43%. His disapproval rating went up a point to 50%. Those numbers are comparable to the 43-50 split he saw right before the federal government entered into a partial shutdown on Oct. 1, in the Sept. 26-28 rolling average. Earlier this week, the Economic Confidence Index saw its biggest plunge since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. There were signs of potential breakthrough in Washington on Thursday, as House Republicans are prepared to extend the nation's ability to borrow to pay its bills for six weeks. But their bill would do nothing to end the standoff on the government shutdown, which entered its 10th day on Thursday.

Via Goldman SachsAt the end of the summer, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein had a fireside chat with the bank's head of human resources Edith Cooper for the summer analyst class.† During that discussion, Blankfein shared his best career advice.†A video of the 42-minute discussion has just been released by the investment bank. † Blankfein also took questions from the interns who were watching globally. †They asked him about his background, how he keeps grounded and his daily routine. † Blankfein has a well-known rags-to-riches story on Wall Street. He grew up in the projects in east Brooklyn. †He's the son of a postal worker and a receptionist. † After graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School, he attended Harvard. †He later received his J.D. and practiced law for a while before going into banking. † One intern based in Salt Lake City asked him how his background and upbringing has shaped his perspective of money, power and the world.† "I read those stories. I know they're interesting. I'm not that comfortable with the old rail splitter walking three miles to return a library book like that whole thing. I talk to kids all the time who grew up in middle class or lower conditions in countries where there was no access and somehow they had much harder scrabble lives than I had and managed to get themselves to fill out an application and got themselves into an Ivy League in the United States and on and on and on....I think it's like a common story here and I think it makes the culture of the firm better. This is not a place that recruits entitled kids for their entitlement...By the way...there are advantages to growing up in a place with a lot of access to a lot of privileges and there are burdens to that also. And the burdens of that are the insecurity that comes from having had things more easily....Whoever you are, wherever you are stationed, these are the cards you got dealt. You can't spend your time wringing your hands about it. You play the cards you have. You accept the burdens in the context of which you came from and enjoy the privileges and don't be guilty and either one of them." One of the main skills Blankfein thinks the interns should have in order to be successful is that they should be a "complete person." † "I think you also have to be a complete person. You have to be interesting. You have to be somebody who is interesting to yourself." A New York-based interns asked him what he does to be complete and what he does to stay grounded.†† "I go from the top of the totem pole to the lowest guy on the totem pole just by going home so that...I strive to get to the surface of the ground. That keeps you grounded," Blankfein joked.† "You know you have these positions and with these positions comes enormous responsibility, too. And it has to work out. You get grounded by circumstances....When you get jobs like this, it's not the end in itself. The goal is to be successful in the job and to be though to well and to produce a good legacy. To me, leave the place stronger than you found it. That's the thing. That's not an achieved by virtue of getting a title. That's something that weighs on me like doing a good job in your job weighs on you. That also keeps you grounded."† Blankfein added that some people can be "haughty" about their position, but he noted that there are people from this intern group who will have very significant accomplishment and do important things for the world.† "When I look out, I don't see people who I have risen above. I just see people who are younger than me." † Blankfein was a history major in college and he loves to read biographies.† A London office intern pointed out that in a lot of biographies the author writes about the subject's daily routine, so he wanted to know what Blankfein does.† "This job is pretty consuming. Last week, I mean I don't want to tell my sad story to you. But last week I was in China, since I was so close I stopped in on Sydney on the way back, which is only 11 hours away in the wrong direction. So I spend a lot of time at this and on Saturday I go to Europe again. When I'm on the plane, you think I'm reading all those...See, people say things that are different from what they do. I tell you how I like to read this stuff. But I'll tell you when I'm on the plane I'm reading my notes for the meetings I'm going to have. "If you look at what I do, I go out I like to run and laugh and jump with the other boys and girls and play golf and do all those things and talk to my kids and lie on the couch. Sometimes I pray for a rainy day so I don't feel guilty about lying on the couch is what I really want to do.†But come Sunday, which it may be depending on the time of the year, the football game will be on or I'm doing it in the morning or the early evening I'm living my next week. I get big briefing books over the weekend with the meetings that I have and notes on it and who they are and they may expect that I know something and I will and I do. There's consequence. It's not just window dressing. I'll get caught up. But that takes time. †And I can't do that five minutes before I'm scheduled to see somebody because my day goes blump, blump, blump...So on Sunday I go through my week and I remind myself during the week..."† He went on to explain that his weekends involve a lot of communication with the folks at the firm, but he still goes on about his weekend life. †He also said that a lot of his social life involves being friends with folks in the industry.† For his parting words, he told the interns to just relax and loosen up a bit. He also shared some words of wisdom from the golf course.† "I would say people at the age of the people in this room could also relax a little bit too. Life is very unpredictable and uncertain. It's good to have your ears open for opportunity. You don't really know yet what business is like or what this industry is like or that firm. You don't really know. Importantly, you don't know yourselves. And so I'd be a little less concerned of where I should be at this time and what kind of skills I should come out of college with...I mean, I thought by now I'd surely be on the Supreme Court having gone to Harvard Law School and practiced in a law firm. It didn't workout that way. That exceptional situation is not the exception, it's the rule. And so it doesn't relieve you from the pressure of trying to get it right as soon as possible right out of the dorm room. And there will be stories of people who do, but it's very unlikely that you will and not highly consequential if you don't get it right right away....I would advise you all to work hard, try to get it right and be a little less anxious.... "I came to golf late, and it's stupid, and anyone who saw me play would be really weirded out that a I use a golf metaphor because I'm so bad. But they always tell you if you hold the club tight it won't go as far and it won't go as straight and if you're loose and your hands are like strings it will whip around and go faster. So less energy is actually more. Loose is better than a hard group. I think that applies to your careers and your life too. If you're loose and comfortable, you may not only be happier you may actually be more successful if you're so focused and tightly wound about things. So lighten up."† Watch the full video from Goldman Sachs &gt;
You don't just run around willy-nilly trying to sell whisky to Americans. We love our bourbon, we respect a good scotch, and there is a time and a place for Irish whisky ó but it had all better be good. So when Wiser's, the number one whisky brand in Canada, invited Business Insider to a tasting for its U.S. launch, our response was basically... 'bring it on, eh.' The tasting was held last night in a private room at Charlie Bird, a new NYC restaurant that's getting a lot of foodie love. And the most important person in attendance was J.P. Wiser's Master Blender Don Livermore. He's been in the business for 17 years ó Master Blender for about two. He's also basically a real life Ron Swanson, since he holds a PhD in wood management and brewing and distillery from Heriot-Watt University in the U.K.. Wiser's itself is one of the oldest whisky brands in Canada, founded in the mid 1800's by J.P Wiser. Before the Highland Clearances had Scots leaving their homes for new lands, and before the American Revolution had loyalists running for the safety of our neighbor to the north, Canadians were rum drinkers. A number of pioneering whisky barons (like J.P. Wiser and Henry Corby, who founded the distillery where Wiser's is made) built the industry out of nothing. The U.S. got more and more of a taste of their work when Civil War and Prohibition took their style south. So what's the style? There are a few things that make Canadian whiskey distinct. It's double distilled (in copper stills), light, aged at least 3 years (4 for the U.S. market), and blended after the grains in the whiskey have been distilled. And of course there's rye. "Rye is the back bone of our whiskey," said Livermore during his lesson. "It's our style." During the tasting, Livermore walked through four different kinds of Wiser's whisky. Now, whisky is a very personal thing. There's no telling what someone is going to like, but it should be said that within Wiser's universe of whiskies there is a lot of variety in terms of taste. More importantly, that variety is delicious. So Livermore can consider this one brought.
YouTubeTesla Motors handled a recent fire in a Model S very well.Since a Tesla Model S caught fire after crashing last week, the big question has been: Is this a major problem for the electric car company? A Quora user phrased it a bit differently, asking, "Can Tesla recover from this battery fire attention?" The best answer came from Jason Lemkin, managing director at Storm Ventures. The fire won't be a problem, he argued, because Tesla clearly presented the facts of the case and properly put the crash in context. With Lemkin's permission, we've republished his excellently reasoned answer: -- Can Tesla recovered from this battery fire attention? Yes, no problem. Elon Musk and Tesla got sufficiently ahead of it and properly explained the fire in context: Model S Fire | Blog | Tesla Motors. Also, no one was injured in a serious accident. High-energy density batteries are potentially bombs, pure and simple. Tesla designed a system of true firewalls to protect against catastrophic explosions that seems to have worked well. Even here, where the "bomb" finally went off due to firewall breaches -- it was contained and there were no injuries and the driver had sufficient warning and time to exit the Model S properly. Accidents happen in cars -- all the time. Every day. The reality is with ~20k Teslas on the road, and tons of accidents already, the fact that this is the first (at least known) explosive fire says it's all working well. See, e.g., Tesla Motors: Tesla Motors Inc.: What happens when a Tesla car crashes? Also, Tesla didn't attempt to blame the customer. They immediately reached out in mostly the right way, and offered him a loaner immediately and provided a Root Cause Analysis, er, explanation for the events. The customer concurred and thanked Tesla. That's the way to do it. Most blame the customer, and/or obscure the facts. Read more from Jason Lemkin at SaaStr.com.
World governments have come under immense pressure to reduce debts and deficits in the post-Financial Crisis era. This resulted in fiscal austerity programs that have inhibited economic growth. However, the worst may be over. "This is best illustrated by measures of the underlying, or cyclically-adjusted, budget deficit," said Capital Economics' Andrew Kenningham pointing to new IMF data. "On this basis, this year‚Äôs fiscal squeeze of around 1.4% of GDP for advanced economies will give way to a tightening of around 0.8% of GDP next year. This is one reason why we are forecasting a gradual acceleration of global growth next year." "The relief is likely to be greatest for the US," noted Kenningham. "Once the shutdown is over, the fiscal year 2014 should see much smaller cuts than in 2013, when the deficit was cut by over 3% of GDP." Capital EconomicsCapital Economics, IMF
APHouse Republican leadership will call a vote on†a short-term debt ceiling increase that would extend the government's ability to pay its bills until shortly before Thanksgiving.† GOP leaders unveiled a plan Thursday that would add five weeks of borrowing authority for the federal government, which time would allow for negotiations among Republicans, Democrats, and President Barack Obama. The bill proposed would not end the ongoing government shutdown, which entered its 10th day on Thursday. "I would hope the president would view this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway," House Speaker John Boehner said in a press conference. Under the plan, the deadline to raise the debt ceiling will be extended from Oct. 17 to Nov. 22. Thanksgiving is the next week, Nov. 28. It's still unclear whether the plan will earn enough support to pass the House. Boehner will likely have to rely on a bevy of votes from House Democrats.† The White House was not impressed with the plan. Though it didn't threaten a veto of the bill if it came to Obama's desk, a White House official said that any negotiations between Republicans and Obama wouldn't start until Republicans first agree to reopen the government. The full statement from a White House official: "The President has made clear that he will not pay a ransom for Congress doing its job and paying our bills. It is better for economic certainty for Congress to take the threat of default off the table for as long as possible, which is why we support the Senate Democratsí efforts to raise the debt limit for a year with no extraneous political strings attached. The President also believes that the Republican Leadership in the House should allow for an up or down vote on the clean continuing resolution passed by the Senate that would pass with a bipartisan majority to reopen the government.† Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the President will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement to create jobs, grow the economy, and put our fiscal house in order.† While we are willing to look at any proposal Congress puts forward to end these manufactured crises, we will not allow a faction of the Republicans in the House to hold the economy hostage to its extraneous and extreme political demands. †Congress needs to pass a clean debt limit increase and a funding bill to reopen the government." When asked about if Republicans still want to defund or delay Obamacare to end the shutdown, Boehner said: "If ands or buts were candy and nuts, then every day would be Christmas."
Henry Blodget / Business InsiderI've been working in and around the tech industry for about two decades, and I had never seen Apple's headquarters. I figured it was time to change that. So the other day, after taking an early flight to San Francisco, I drove down to Cupertino. I tweeted about this adventure as it unfolded, and lots of you asked for pictures. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't allow you to take pictures†within the "mothership," as the global headquarters is known, but there's plenty to see on the outside. So here we go... (I'm not going to pretend I wasn't excited to visit Apple, by the way. I was. This was a pilgrimage to the heart of a legendary company that continues to make history. If I hadn't been excited, there would have been something wrong with me.)
REUTERS/Aly SongThe Shanghai Composite fell 1% on Thursday, with Chinese brokerages taking the biggest hit. Citic Securities, China's largest brokerage, was down 3.7%.  This comes on news that the government wants banks to unwind the controversial wealth management products (WMPs) and switch to asset management plans (AMPs). WMPs make up the $2 trillion powder keg at the heart of China's banking system. In a quest for higher returns, tons of people have been pouring their wealth into WMPs, which are sold as high yielding,† low-risk investments offering "expected" instead of "guaranteed or promised returns." This flood of deposits is key reason behind the surge in social financing and banksí fee income in recent years. WMP holders largely view these as "investments as deposits" according to†Bank of America's David Cui, while in reality they take the hit if the investments go bad. And it is "this perception mismatch" that "prompts banks to seek undue risks when investing 'other peopleís money he writes. This has obviously been unsustainable. In late 2012, we saw investors take to the streets when WMPs they bought from Huaxia Bank soured. AMPs on the other hand will only provide investors with a "possible range of returns," and they are open-ended. Initially they will only be allowed to invest in direct debt financing instruments (DDFIs) like securitized bank loans and other such assets, that can be traded on China's interbank market. So what's the rationale for switching to AMPs? "The key change is to remove an implicit guarantee of principle and yield, in the form of 'expected return,' by WMPs," writes Cui. For now, 11 banks are testing out AMPs, but if these are successful, they could have bigger implications on China's financial market. Cui argues that consumers stand to gain while financial institutions stand to lose. This is largely because investors will become more aware of the risks that come with these products, and will therefore be less likely to place their money there. From Cui: "This probably means that total social financing growth will slow down and hurt investment. Banksí fee income should also suffer: with WMPs, they took a spread between what they pay investors and what they get; with AMPs, they may only be able to book a management fee. The new rules may also eliminate the banksí needs to use other financial intermediates to structure off balance sheet products to satisfy regulatory requirements." This would also have broader implications for the economy as credit growth would slow, and this would trickle over to sectors that rely on investment. Of course the success of AMPs is far from certain, as banks are unlikely to be too enthusiastic about this new investment product.
A Business Insider-SurveyMonkey Audience poll asked New Yorkers to pick which neighborhoods have the best food, the best bars, and the most attractive people, among many other things.¬† A few months ago, we ran a poll that asked Americans what they thought of other states ‚Äî which were the drunkest, hottest, and had the silliest accents.¬† Since New Yorkers came up as rudest last time we asked, we figured they would be blunt with us, so we tried the whole thing over again, asking about New York City neighborhoods. The poll was carried out using¬†SurveyMonkey's Audience¬†feature, which¬†was more accurate¬†predicting the 2012 election than numerous traditional pollsters.¬† We asked 414 New Yorkers ‚Äî someone who lives and/or works in New York City ‚Äî to answer 24 questions about the neighborhoods. Below we've mapped the percentage of people who named each area for different questions. Source Map: Mike Nudelman Coloration: Walter Hickey, Business Insider
Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergThe most closely watched market all week has been the Treasury bill market. Yields on 1-month Treasury bills have been soaring as market participants priced in greater and greater chances of a default on these bills resulting from inability in Congress to agree on raising the debt ceiling, which the Treasury will otherwise hit on October 17. Today, the stock market is rallying on the prospect that warring parties in Washington will agree on a short-term debt ceiling increase that extends the debate for another six weeks. As a result, the T-bills that have been getting killed this week ó those maturing between October 17 and October 31, the timeframe over which a default scenario would be most likely ó are catching a nice bid, and yields are dropping. However, as the chart above shows, yields on 1-month bills six weeks out ó when the proposed extension would end ó are actually rising (especially those maturing November 29). Perhaps market participants are already preparing for round two. SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale global strategist Kit Juckes says if politicians do agree to this short-term increase, a fourth-quarter rally in risk assets is out the window.
ReutersIndia's rupee has faced a lot of volatility over the past few months. But some believe the worst is over. Demand at government bond auctions is up after months of failed auctions, the Wall Street Journal reported. The rupee has gained nearly 9.2% since lows in the beginning of September. But it is still over 16% lower than last year.¬† In an effort to drum up enthusiasm among foreign investors, the¬† government has partnered with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) to launch its first offshore rupee bond program. The partnership with the IFC aims at allaying foreign investors' fears over India's slowing growth and policy paralysis.  As part of this effort, the bonds will be sold in dollars, and then converted back to rupees which would be invested in India's private sector, according to the FT. Investors would be repaid in dollars, but returns would depend on fluctuations in the rupee's interest rates and exchange rates. "By co-working with the World Bank you get some of the credit risks involved with India off the table," Vishnu Varathan, an economist at Mizuho, told the BBC.¬† The proposal was quickly accepted by India's gridlocked political machinery. The chief executive of the IFC, Jin Yong Cai, told the FT, "Suddenly you have all these dislocations and volatility of the exchange rate... People realise, boy, this is an important thing." The first offshore rupee bond auction is expected to take place before the end of 2013. 
(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)This spring, Business Insider took a deep dive into how to decide whether you should get your CFA or MBA ‚Äî now we're getting more personal. We found that both accreditations have their purposes. For example, the CFA charter is better if you want to be an analyst, and the MBA is better if you want a more diverse skill set. But this is a hotly debated topic, one that get people frothing at the mouth and rolling their eyes. So there's a lot more to be broken down here. We reached out to sources who hold either CFA charters or MBA degrees to find out what makes one better than the other. Agree to disagree?
The Great Recession came with high jobless rates, putting financial and emotional strain on the American consumer. Economists follow consumer sentiment trends closely as it is tied to economic activity. However, falling sentiment can be tied to other phenomena that isn't captured by economic data. Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, William Schneider, and Jane Waldfogel examine the correlation between sentiment and parenting in a new paper titled: "The Great Recession and the risk for child maltreatment." "We find that the large decline in consumer confidence during the Great Recession, as measured by the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), was associated with worse parenting behavior," they wrote. "In particular, lower levels of consumer confidence were associated with increased levels of high frequency spanking, a parenting behavior that is associated with greater likelihood of being contacted by child protective services." "When CSI was 55, only 1.36% of the children were spanked at high frequency," they wrote. "As CSI increased, indicating worse consumer confidence, the percentage of children spanked at high frequency increasedñrising roughly between 0.5 and 1.5 percentage points for every 5-point rise in CSI. When confidence was at its worst (CSI of 85) at the height of the recession, high frequency spanking was predicted to increase to 8.32% of the sample, a rate approximately 6 times what it was when confidence was better (CSI of 55)." In other words: "Before the recession, less than two percent of the nine year-olds they studied in Americaís major cities were at risk of being abused in this way, but when the drop in consumer confidence reached is nadir, close to 8% were," said University of Ottawa's Miles Corak, who alerted us to the study. "Although it is recognized that spanking in and of itself does not necessarily amount to physical abuse, a broad range of research has linked spanking with negative child behaviors," said Brooks-Gunn, Schneider, and Waldfogel. Very sad. The Great Recession and the risk for child maltreatment"The chances children experience frequent physical abuse rose six-fold as consumer confidence fell between 2007 and 2010.

flickr/Angelo DeSantisStocks are rallying as the possibility of a short-term debt ceiling increase to allow for further negotiations between warring parties in Washington comes into view. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale global strategist Kit Juckes thinks this will prove to be negative for risk assets, contrary to the market's initial reaction to this news. There are an awful lot of cross-currents in markets at the moment," wrote Juckes in a note to clients this morning. "The U.S.¬†political protagonists are talking again and Yellen‚Äôs nomination has been well received.¬†Equities, credit and EM assets are all holding up reasonably well, despite upward pressure on¬†U.S. yields amid reports of higher 'haircuts' on T-Bills as concerns grow about whether the¬†debt ceiling can be increased before coupon payments are due. The result is that holding on¬†to positions is harder." A short-term debt ceiling increase would likely extend the debate for another six weeks, bringing the potential for another crisis into view by Thanksgiving. "The risk in the U.S. is that when a 'deal' gets done to raise the debt ceiling, it is a temporary debt ceiling increase that doesn‚Äôt resolve the underlying issues," says Juckes. "If that happens, any hope of Q4 risk rally taking hold will be out of the window."
You could almost hear the collective mocking across Wall Street yesterday when the news broke that analyst Meredith Whitney is starting a long/short equity hedge fund. Twitter's reaction to Business Insider's own story was indication enough ‚Äî "Wrong/Short Strategy," picked up steam for a while. The Internet giggled. But why? Sure Whitney's been wrong, but a lot of people have been wrong. In fact some of the biggest, baddest hedge fund managers on the Street have had hedge funds blow up on them before (Bill Ackman's Gotham Partners, for one). And at the very least we know Meredith Whitney is no dummy ‚Äî so why not give her a chance to put up some numbers and see what she's made of before laughing at the idea that she's going to be a hedge fund manager? To review: Meredith Whitney got famous as an analyst back in 2007, when she called that Citi was under capitalized. All Wall Street followed suit and the bank lost $50 billion in value in less than a month. Since then her calls haven't necessarily panned out, her biggest fail being the argument that municipal governments would go bankrupt. She even wrote a book about it. So when reports surfaced this summer that Whitney's advisory firm was rapidly losing clients and employees, and hadn't made a profit in years¬† there was even more schadenfreude. Word on the Street was that she was spending a lot of time in Bermuda (where her new hedge fund is incorporated, by the way). Which brings us back to yesterday's reaction to the news that she had dumped her brokerage business ‚Äî a business everyone on Wall Street says is broken anyway ‚Äî and is launching a fund called Kenbelle Capital. The reaction was collective, and it was fierce. It was almost as if we'd forgotten that there are more hedge funds than Taco Bells in this country. It was almost as if Whitney was three college kids from North Carolina that were starting "The World's Most Oblivious Hedge Fund." It was almost as if she was starting a Bitcoin ETF. But she's not. Whitney has had a massive call that went right, and she's gotten some things wrong. So have guys like John Paulson, though. Last year his¬† funds were getting killed, but his numbers for this year have been spectacular. Now, to be clear, this is not a 'Meredith Whitney will be a great hedge fund manager' argument. Quite the contrary, I have no idea how she'll do. But at this point, no one else does either.
Via the Data Is Beautiful subreddit and user bls_is_the_best, here is a .gif showing the evolution of unemployment in all 50 states from 2006 to the present. It's incredible to think how bad things got in 2009, and how far we've come since. 
Back in May, we highlighted the persistence of high short-interest in some of the big year-to-date-winners. Dan posted commentary with the title, ‚ÄúConcentrated Longs with High Short Interest are a Trader‚Äôs Dream‚Äù which highlighted TSLA, GMCR, FSLR, and HLF. I followed that up with a Macro Wrap detailing how short interest had changed for the big winners in 2013. With the absolute battering experienced by some of the YTD leaders in 2013, we wanted to take a look at how much short interest (and hence, one group of potential buyers) has been reduced over the past six months: Risk Reversal The largest reduction has been in GME, which has seen short interest plummet from around 40% of float to around 15% of float in the past 6 months. GME is up 60% since April, with a good bit of fuel for the rally undoubtedly coming from short covering. More surprisingly, MU has actually seen short interest increase even as the stock has doubled since April. Granted, short interest was much lower than the other stocks to start, but still a surprising development. For the most part, the big winners have seen short interest decline, but not as much as I would have expected given the extent of the moves that we have seen. Stocks like TSLA and P that have more than doubled in 2013 still have relatively high short interest ratios, and less short covering than I would have expected. GME is the one stock that stands out as a name with dramatically lower short interest, and a much higher stock price. There is one other aspect of the technical picture in GME that stands out like a sore thumb. Stay tuned for those thoughts in a post focused on GME in the next couple of days. ¬†
Goldman SachsWith the October 17 debt ceiling "deadline" approaching, both parties are holding firm and trading indignant press conferences. So while markets are still relatively complacent, we were wondering what would happen in the disaster scenario: a true default. That is, what happens if we fail to raise the debt ceiling, run out of cash, and the President or Treasury cannot/will not gimmick¬†its way into making payments? On or around October 31, Goldman Sachs estimates that Treasury will have insufficient cash.¬† At that point, "The worst case scenario is a real default recognized by rating agencies," Brown Brothers Harriman's Marc Chandler told Business Insider. If we choose to default, ratings agencies would likely give the U.S. a rating of "selective default." As HSBC noted,¬†sovereigns that have been SD in the past normally end up as sub-investment grade ‚Äî CCC+ to B ‚Äî and the thought of the world's wealthiest country falling to that level is almost "farcical." "A real genuine default will have ripple effects." Chandler says the government can probably miss a payment for a few days, but eventually a "true default" would mean that businesses who contract for the the federal government will not get paid. That would spook markets even more than simply crossing the October 17 threshold. Stocks would also surely tumble. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco ‚Äî who admittedly said the the likelihood of this scenario happening is 0% ‚Äî calculated that¬†the S&amp;P would lose about half its value.¬† And say goodbye to 4.2% of GDP growth, according¬†Goldman Sachs economists Alec Phillips and Kris Dawsey.¬† "It would be very messy and it would hurt a lot of innocent people," Chandler said, adding that corporate bonds and our close trading partners Canada and Mexico would also take a hit. "Since we've never seen a debt default for the world's reserve currency we are talking about something that has no precedence and as such is impossible to model,"¬†said¬†Gluskin-Sheff's David Rosenberg. "It is a known risk so it is not a Black Swan, but we have no experience in measuring the consequences." "Perhaps a template would be the pricing action that took place 'ahead of the event' in late summer 2011 but this time the effects are likely to be amplified," Rosenberg said.  REUTERS/ Jim Urquhart "In terms of a market call, I would be stunned if gold did not break out massively to the upside if we get beyond¬†October 17th¬†without a resolution." Bond expert Tom Digaloma,¬†managing director at ED&amp;F Man Capital, said that his default scenario would mean a sell-off in the 10-year treasury back to 2.8-2.85% yield.  "I also believe the front-end [0-3yr] could rise 10-15 bps as panic selling ensues from central banks and corporate cash accounts," he said. Digaloma thinks the odds of default are rather low, but "anything cant happen when politicians are in control." PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian gave us his "worst case scenario." Risk assets would likely come under greater pressure, reacting to every signal out of DC. Meanwhile, normal market functioning, including the important repo function, would be subject to growing strain and stress. In the weeks that follow, the Treasury Department would be forced into a very delicate and challenging process of payment prioritization or delaying some payments outright. In either case, officials would probably seek to protect to the maximum extent possible the full faith and credit of the nation. As other spending commitments are cut very hard, equities would sell off significantly on concern of a major recession while Treasuries would likely out-perform. If this process is drawn out ‚Äì and, remember please, we believe that the probability of getting to this stage is very, very low ‚Äì the U.S. could¬† default on debt payments. While it would be doing so due to the lack of political willingness rather than financial ability, the result would be the same: The world would most likely be facing the likelihood of a great depression. Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors and former Chief Investment Strategist of¬†Merrill Lynch, put it simply: "All I'll say is that politicians always talk about protecting future generations.¬†Well, if you want to HURT future generations there is no simpler way to do so than just defaulting on the debt." "No country in history has ever gotten a cheaper cost of capital by defaulting," Bernstein concluded.
REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueJack LewSecretary Treasury Jack Lew is speaking to the Senate Finance Committee to explain what breaching the debt ceiling means. In his prepared remarks, he warned that the biggest risk to U.S. growth is a "manufactured crisis" in Washington and self-inflicted wounds. Social Security payments would be threatened he added. When the U.S. hits the debt ceiling, it will no longer be able to borrow money by issuing Treasury bonds. This means the government would quickly run out of cash as it pays its obligations. Some have suggested the government would have to prioritize payments as cash levels fall. However, Lew warned that there would be "irrevocable damage" from prioritizing payments. During the Q&amp;A, Lew characterized prioritization as "default by another name." According to Bloomberg, Lew said defaulting could hurt stocks, the dollar, and short-term Treasury securities. The economy would benefit from less brinksmanship, he said. Here's Lew's full prepared remarks: TESTIMONY OF SECRETARY JACOB J. LEW BEFORE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON THE DEBT LIMIT WASHINGTON - Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Hatch, and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the potential impacts of a failure by Congress to increase the debt ceiling.† This is an important moment in American history, and Congress has an important choice to make for the American people.† Congress alone has the power to act to make sure that the full faith and credit of the United States is never called into question.† No Congress in 224 years of American history has allowed our country to default, and it is my sincere hope that this Congress will not be the first.† At the same time, Congress should pass legislation to fund the government and end the standoff.  State of U.S. Economy and Fiscal Position Since February 2010, private employers have added about 7 and a half million jobs, and over the last year alone they added more than 2 million jobs.† Manufacturing is expanding while the housing market continues to improve, posting gains in sales, prices, and residential construction.†  At the same time, we have been working with Congress to achieve a sustainable fiscal path.† In its most recent estimates, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the 2013 deficit would be less than half the more than 9 percent of GDP deficit the President inherited.† The rapid deficit reduction of the past two years is the result of both a stronger economy and the deficit reduction that the President has already signed into law. Among the risks that we control, the biggest threat to sustained growth in our economy is the recurrence of manufactured crises in Washington and self-inflicted wounds.† Unfortunately, we now face a manufactured political crisis that is beginning to deliver an unnecessary blow to our economy ñ right at a time when the U.S. economy and the American people have painstakingly fought back from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Private-sector economists have estimated that a two-week government shutdown could directly reduce real GDP growth in the fourth quarter by about a quarter percentage point at an annual rate.† Some have warned that a longer shutdown would reduce economic growth as much as 1Ω percentage points.† These estimates typically do not include the additional spillovers that seem likely:† household and business confidence in the government could fall sharply, and other spending that relies on a functioning federal government could be postponed or cancelled.† Why would anyone want to do that to our economy?  In addition to the economic cost of the shutdown, the uncertainty around raising the debt limit is beginning to stress the financial markets.† Yields on Treasury bills maturing in the second half of October and early November have already surpassed the peaks on similarly affected maturities in July 2011.† At our auction of four-week Treasury bills on Tuesday, the interest rate nearly tripled relative to the prior weekís auction and reached the highest level since Oct 2008.† Measures of expected volatility in the stock market have risen to the highest levels of the year. The only way to avoid further self-inflicted wounds to our economy is for Congress to act.† I know from my conversations with a wide range of business leaders representing industries from retail to manufacturing to banking that this is a paramount concern for them.† That is why it is important for Congress to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, and then to work with the President to address our long-term fiscal challenges in a balanced and thoughtful way. Potential Economic Impact of Failure to Raise the Debt Limit The Treasury Department recently released a report examining the potential macroeconomic effects of political brinksmanship in 2011, and the potential risks of waiting until the last possible moment to increase the debt limit in the current economic environment.† It points to the potentially catastrophic impacts of default, including credit market disruptions, a significant loss in the value of the dollar, markedly elevated U.S. interest rates, negative spillover effects to the global economy, and real risk of a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse. If interest rates rose, it would have a real impact on American households.† The stock market, including investments in retirement accounts, could tumble, and it could become more expensive for Americans to buy a car, own a home, and open a small business. These additional costs of borrowing could not easily be undone and our actions would impact Americans for generations to come. Failing to raise the debt ceiling will impact everyday Americans beyond its impact on financial markets.† For example, doctors receiving reimbursements under Medicare would likely continue to provide services on a timely basis, but they would be operating with significant uncertainty about when they would be paid by the government for their services. †For millions of low-income Americans who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare, the federal governmentís payments to states for the federal contribution would likely also be impacted.† These providers still have to pay their doctors, nurses, and staff, but absent timely federal payments, many could face real liquidity challenges.† And for those waiting on benefits who need those funds in order to refill their refrigerator ñ if that money doesnít flow, they wonít go to the grocery store to shop, creating ripple effects that would be felt throughout the economy.† The bottom line is that failing to raise the debt ceiling creates a very difficult and unfair situation, and one that is completely avoidable if Congress acts. It is also important to note that the federal government has numerous large payments that are due shortly after October 17, when we will have exhausted our borrowing authority and will only have cash on hand to meet our obligations.† Between October 17 and November 1, we have large payments to Medicare providers, Social Security beneficiaries, and veterans, as well as salaries for active duty members of the military.† A failure to raise the debt limit could put timely payment of all of these at risk.  We need to look no further than 2011 for evidence of what just an extended debate on the merits of raising the debt limit can do to our economy.† In 2011, U.S. government debt was downgraded for the first time in history, the stock market fell, measures of volatility jumped, and credit risk spreads widened noticeably; these financial market effects persisted for months. To be sure, other forces both at home and abroad also played a role, but the uncertainty surrounding whether or not the U.S. government would pay its bills had a lasting impact on both markets and the economy. History of Bipartisan Support for Increasing the Debt Limit Republican and Democratic Presidents and Treasury Secretaries alike have universally understood the importance of protecting one of our most precious assets ñ the full faith and credit of the United States.† President Reagan wrote to Congress in 1983: ìThis country now possesses the strongest credit in the world.† The full consequences of a default ñ or even the serious prospect of default ñ by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate.† Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange markets.î Employers across the country also understand the importance of what is at stake if we default on our debts for the first time in American history.† Last week, 251 business organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and National Retail Federation wrote in a letter to Congress: ìWe urge Congress to act promptly to pass a Continuing Resolution to fund the government and to raise the debt ceiling, and then to return to work on these other vital issues.î  No credible economist or business leader thinks that defaulting is good for job creation or economic growth.† Henry Paulson, Treasury Secretary under President George W. Bush, said last month, ìit is unthinkable that Congress wouldnít live up to our commitment to make good on past spending commitments and obligations.î† Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke said recently, ìa failure to raise the debt limit could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the economy.î† And Warren Buffett said last week that ìit makes absolutely no senseî for some in Congress to use the debt ceiling as leverage, saying ìit ought to be banned as a weapon . . . . It should be like nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to use.î† They understand that Congress choosing not to pay the governmentís bills is unacceptable and could do irrevocable harm to our economy.  If Congress fails to meet its responsibility, it could be deeply damaging to the financial markets, the ongoing economic recovery, and the jobs and savings of millions of Americans.† I have a responsibility to be transparent with the American people about these risks.† And I think it would be a grave mistake to discount or dismiss them.† For these reasons, I have repeatedly urged Congress to take action immediately so we can honor all of the countryís past commitments.  James Baker, Treasury Secretary under President Reagan, made this point to Congress in 1987, saying, ìRunning out of cash means that the United States would default on its obligations both domestic and foreign, with all the negative financial, legal and moral consequences that implies.† Our Founding Fathers regarded the full faith and credit of the United States as a sacred trust, and for over 200 years the United States has upheld this fiduciary duty.† The United States has never defaulted on its debt obligations.† To do so would be unthinkable and irresponsible.† We would seriously erode this countryís premier credit position and break faith with our citizens.î Treasuryís Communication with Congress  Earlier this year, Congress enacted the No Budget No Pay Act that increased the debt ceiling through May 18.† Upon reaching that date, Treasury began using what are called extraordinary measures to avoid defaulting on our obligations.† The Treasury Department has been open and transparent, regularly updating Congress over the course of the last five months as new information has become available about when we would exhaust our extraordinary measures.† In addition, Treasury has provided information about what our cash balances will be when we exhaust our extraordinary measures.† As our forecasts have changed, I have consistently updated Congress in order to give Congress the best information about the urgency with which they should act.† And last month, I met with the full membership of this committee to discuss these issues.  On August 26, I notified Congress that these extraordinary measures would be exhausted by the middle of October, and that I anticipated a cash balance of roughly $50 billion at the point of exhaustion.† On September 25, I wrote to Congress again to notify that, due to lower-than-expected quarterly revenue collections and changes in the size and timing of certain large trust fund transactions, we then projected that extraordinary measures would be exhausted no later than October 17, and that our remaining cash balance would be closer to $30 billion.† Most recently, just last week, I sent a letter to Congress that said, as of October 1, Treasury has begun using the final extraordinary measures.† There are no other legal and prudent options to extend the nationís borrowing authority and provide Congress with more time to act.  Treasury continues to believe that extraordinary measures will be exhausted no later than October 17, 2013, at which point the federal government will have run out of borrowing authority.† At that point we will be left to meet our countryís commitments with only the cash on hand and any incoming revenues, placing our economy in a dangerous position.† We will continue to monitor the impact of the protracted government shutdown on revenues and expenditures.† If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations ñ including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans, and contracts with private suppliers ñ for the first time in our history.† At the same time, we are relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds.† Every week, we roll-over approximately $100 billion in U.S. bills.† If U.S. bond holders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll-over their Treasury investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance. Let me be clear. Trying to time a debt limit increase to the last minute could be very dangerous. If Congress does not act and the U.S. suddenly cannot pay its bills, the repercussions would be serious. Irresponsible Arguments Against Raising the Debt Limit  Raising the debt limit is Congressís responsibility because Congress, and Congress alone, is empowered to set the maximum amount the government can borrow to meet its financial obligations.†  Some in Congress have suggested that raising the debt limit should be paired with accompanying spending cuts and reforms.† I have repeatedly noted that the debt limit has nothing to do with new spending.† It has to do with spending that Congress has already approved and bills that have already been incurred.† Failing to raise the debt limit would not make these bills disappear.† The President remains willing to negotiate over the future direction of fiscal policy, but he will not negotiate over whether the United States should pay its bills.  Certain members of the House and Senate believe that it is possible to protect our economy by simply paying only the interest on our debts, while stopping or delaying payments on a number of our other legal commitments.†The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens.† There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets.  As administrations of both political parties have previously determined, these ìprioritizationî proposals do not solve the problem.† They represent an irresponsible retreat from a core American value: since 1789, regardless of party, Presidents and Congress have always honored all of our commitments.†We cannot afford for Congress to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United States of America.† At the same time, we should never be put in a position where we have to pick which commitments our nation should meet.† How can the United States choose whether to send Social Security checks to seniors or pay benefits to our veterans?† How can the United States choose whether to provide children with food assistance or meet our obligations to Medicare providers? Rational decisions require assessing abstract risks ñ the alternative is trial and error.† We are seeing with the government shutdown how those that denied there would be any impact are struggling every day to address real consequences with patches.† This does not work.† They need to open the government. It is irresponsible and reckless to insist that we experience a forced default to learn how bad it is.† If anything at all is learned from the shutdown, it will convince the deniers ñ or a majority who can work their will ñ to avoid putting the entire economy at risk in the name of an ideological fight. There is a suggestion by some in Congress that the debt limit has traditionally been used as a tool to address budgetary and fiscal issues.† This is not historically accurate.† Since World War II, Congress has routinely raised the debt limit through standalone legislation signed by both Democratic and Republican Presidents.† Since President Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, Congress has enacted 45 different pieces of legislation to raise, extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit.  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, between 1981 and 2011, policymakers enacted nine bipartisan deficit reduction packages.† Only three of those legislative packages also included debt limit increases: In each of these three instances, the debate was driven by fiscal policy and how to achieve deficit reduction in a responsible, balanced manner.† Neither political party thought that defaulting on our debt was a serious, credible option.† In 1985, the need to raise the debt limit served as a deadline for budget negotiations.† In 1990, Congress and the President worked together to avoid across-the-board cuts from the original Gramm-Rudman sequestration, which were universally viewed as the wrong way to reduce the deficit.† In 1997, Congress added a debt limit increase at the end of negotiations, after the parties agreed on a deal to reduce the deficit responsibly and grow the economy.† I participated personally in many of these negotiations, and I do not recall anyone ever seriously suggesting that the United States should fail to pay its bills.†  The summer of 2011 was different.† Certain Members of Congress argued that default was an acceptable outcome if they were unable to achieve their legislative objectives.† Rather than enter into a good-faith compromise on fiscal issues, these Members argued that the United States should voluntarily fail to pay its bills if their position was not accepted.† Our economy paid a significant price for these irresponsible and protracted threats.† The full faith and credit of the United States is not a bargaining chip.† It is reckless and irresponsible to put our full faith and credit at risk. The President has been and is willing to negotiate over the future direction of long-term fiscal policy.† He has repeatedly proposed a comprehensive and balanced package of deficit reduction proposals.† And that is why he proposed a budget that reflects the difficult choices he believes we need to make as a country.† Within that budget, the President included entitlement reforms, unpopular with many Democrats, and tax reform that would spur economic growth and cut our deficit.† And he has made it absolutely clear that he is ready to sit down with Republicans and Democrats to find common ground.† The House and Senate have each passed their own budgets, and on 18 separate occasions the Senate Budget Committee Chair has requested that a conference committee be convened so both sides can negotiate and iron out their differences.† But Republicans have refused each of those requests.† And so instead of negotiating a budget deal over the last 6 months, as Democrats have requested, we now find ourselves on the precipice with some Republicans once again threatening default. Conclusion  Leaders have a responsibility to make our economy stronger, not to create manufactured crises that inflict damage.†† The very last thing we need now is a fight over whether we raise the debt ceiling.† Not when we face serious challenges both domestically and internationally that require our full attention. And not when we know the kind of damage a financial and economic crisis can cause.†  A great democracy does not lurch from one self-inflicted crisis to another.† The time for discussions around the fiscal choices we need to make should not take place after we shut down the government or in the last seconds before a default.† The time for these discussions is during the normal budget process.† This is a stand that Democratic and Republican Presidents must take to make clear that under no circumstances will the United States fail to pay our bills.  I will close by noting that as we meet today, finance ministers from all over the world are gathered in Washington for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, and itís worth taking a moment to recognize that our country has special role in global financial markets.† The United States is the anchor of the international financial system.† It is the worldís largest economy with the deepest and most liquid financial markets.† When risk rises, the flight to safety and to quality brings investors to U.S. markets.† Other countries look to us for how to govern and how to maintain economic vitality.† The United States cannot take this hard-earned reputation for granted.† We have spent 224 years building the nationís credit as the strongest in the world, and only Congress can act to protect it.† A default for the first time in our history could pose serious risks to our global standing. The simple truth is Congress must get this done.† The time to do it is now before any more damage is done to the U.S. economy.
REUTERS/Rick WilkingJob seekers listen to a presentation at the Colorado Hospital Association health care career fair in Denver April 9, 2013.The Department of Labor's latest tally of initial unemployment claims is out, and the numbers look bad. Claims surged to 374,000 from 308,000 a week ago. This was much worse than the 311,000 expected by economists. Bloomberg reports that around half of the 66,000 increase was due to technical issues in California. "The dismissal of non-federal employees after Congress failed to compromise on a budget accounted for about another 15,000," reported Bloomberg citing a Labor Department spokesman. Even excluding these items, claims would've been worse than expected. The jump in claims caused the 4-week average to climb to 325,000, up from 305,000 a week ago. "The broader picture is still that labour market conditions are improving, albeit not quite as much as we previously thought," said Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth.

www.gpif.go.jpAbenomics, the controversial Japanese economic program, has led to an upsurge in popularity for their architect Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister. The program is a potent cocktail of both aggressive monetary policy and loose fiscal policy. But the increasing public debt and declining bond yields that easy monetary policy brings has one demographic group worried: Japan's enormous population of pensioners. Lower bond yields will send Japanese pension funds, which are highly exposed to government debt, spiraling into losses, reports Bloomberg.† The world's largest retirement savings fund, Japan's $1,25 trillion†Government Pension Investment Fund, will be particularly hard hit. It has nearly 60% of its portfolio in Japanese government debt.† FRED Adjusted for inflation, real yields on Japanese government bonds are now negative.. Takatoshi Ito, head of an expert panel on public investments, told Bloomberg that the fund is exposed to "too much interest-rate risk,î and needs to invest in higher-yield providing alternatives such as†real-estate trusts, infrastructure and private-equity investments and commodities. The panel will issue its final recommendations†next month. Meanwhile, the pension fund behemoth is taking small steps toward diversification. Last week, it announced measures that indicated it was in the process of separating out some of its assets and setting up a 'baby fund' to diversify its investments. † Japan's population is sharply in decline. 23.1% of Japan's population is over the age of 65.†Japan's age dependency ratio, the ratio of†people older than 64 to the working-age population was†39 as of last year. As a comparison, "young" countries like India have a dependency ratio of 8.†The Japanese saving rate, has also been falling for the last five years, which brings into question the sustainability of Japan's debt financing.
REUTERS/Mike SegarA sign announcing the closure of the Statue of Liberty, a U.S. National Park, due to the U.S. Government shutdown stands near the ferry dock to the Statue of Liberty in Battery Park in New York, October 1, 2013.The U.S. government shutdown has led to the furloughs of an estimated 800,000 government workers. And many of these workers are expected to head to the unemployment office to collect unemployment insurance payments. However, these people won't cause the widely-followed U.S. initial jobless claims to explode from 6-year lows. JP Morgan's U.S. economics team explains: We do not expect the government shutdown to have a major impact on the initial claims data. The initial claims data (which are compiled by state governments before being sent to the federal government) are being reported normally despite the government shutdown. And while government workers can file for unemployment insurance, their claims are separated from the regular claims poolóthere was a massive jump in the number of claims filed in federal programs around the 1995/1996 government shutdown, but the standard initial claims number did not increase significantly. Data on claims in federal programs are reported with an additional lag of one week relative to the regular initial claims data. The claims report will be released at 8:50 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting 310,000, up from 308,000 a week ago.
‚ÄúI pledge to do my utmost to keep that trust and meet the great responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to the Federal Reserve‚Äìto promote maximum employment, stable prices, and a strong and stable financial system.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really see how this is surprising.¬† The Fed claims to have a dual mandate ‚Äì to maintain price stability and promote maximum employment.¬† But it can really only achieve these mandates if it FIRST maintains a stable financial system.¬† Make no mistake here.¬† Janet Yellen is an exceedingly intelligent woman.¬† She understands the Fed and the Fed‚Äôs history like the back of her hand.¬† And I can assure you that she is uniquely familiar with the Fed‚Äôs history.¬† She knows full well that the Fed wasn‚Äôt created to hit employment and inflation targets, but was actually created to support the payments system.¬† As the Fed has explained: ‚ÄúBy creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system.‚Äù The Fed system was created to support the private payments system controlled by the banking system at the time.¬† In fact, the Fed system is modelled after the New York Clearing House model which was a privately managed clearing house for bank payment settlement that existed prior to the Fed.¬† After the crisis of 1907 the government got more involved in the process to help oversee and manage the process.¬† The result of this was the Federal Reserve System which is really just one big payments system attached to the banking system.¬† Which is another reason why it‚Äôs so bizarre that some economists want to ‚Äúkeep banks out of macro‚Äù while also focusing on nothing but central banking. To understand central banking and monetary policy IS TO UNDERSTAND BANKING. The Fed was created with one primary mandate ‚Äì to help stabilize the payments system.¬† And if it doesn‚Äôt achieve this goal then it can‚Äôt even begin to think about inflation and employment.¬† Some economists seem to have missed this important fact about the history of the Fed and have instead constructed this mythical world where the Fed hits employment and inflation targets without working with the banking system.¬† Thankfully, Janet Yellen isn‚Äôt in that camp.
