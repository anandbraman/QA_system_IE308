APHouse Republicans on Tuesday evening failed to get the required two-thirds majority to pass a series of bills that would have reopened and funded certain parts of the government, and the federal government will enter its second day in partial shutdown. The three bills would have funded veterans programs, national parks, and the District of Columbia — three of the most visible effects of the first federal government shutdown in 17 years.  House and Senate Democrats derided the plan as a gimmick, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) charged that Republicans were "trying to cherry-pick the few parts of government they like." And in the end, the majority failed to persuade enough House Democrats to join them to get a required two-thirds majority and pass the bills. A House Democratic aide told Business Insider that House GOP leadership likely put the bills under suspension — thus requiring a two-thirds majority to pass — because it was worried about Democrats bringing up a motion to recommit. That's a procedural rule that would allow Democrats to swap in the so-called "clean" continuing resolution that funds the government through Nov. 15. On CNN after the votes, a furious House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) blasted Democrats and President Barack Obama in a statement. "Why is it that you can say, well, we're just not going to support those things?" Cantor said. "That's a terrible message to send to people who are hurting right now." Cantor hinted that House Republicans could bring up the bills again for a majority vote on Wednesday.  After the Senate had adjourned until 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Reid fired back at House Republicans. He called on House Speaker John Boehner to "stop the games" and bring the Senate's "clean" CR to fully fund the government for a vote on the House floor. But as the federal government ended its first day in partial shutdown, there was no clear end in sight. "Speaker Boehner has the votes to re-open the government and he knows it," Reid said.  "By refusing to let the House vote on the only bill that will re-open the government, Speaker Boehner is single-handedly keeping the government shut down. It is time for Speaker Boehner to stop the games, think about the people he is hurting, and let the House pass the Senate's bill to re-open the government with Republican and Democratic votes."
NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Three of the top 20 investors in Microsoft Corp are lobbying the board to press for Bill Gates to step down as chairman of the software company he co-founded 38 years ago, according to people familiar with matter. While Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been under pressure for years to improve the company's performance and share price, this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at Gates, who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology. A representative for Microsoft declined to comment on Tuesday. There is no indication that Microsoft's board would heed the wishes of the three investors, who collectively hold more than 5 percent of the company's stock, according to the sources. They requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions are private. Gates owns about 4.5 percent of the $277 billion company and is its largest individual shareholder. The three investors are concerned that Gates' presence on the board effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes. In particular, they point to Gates' role on the special committee searching for Ballmer's successor. They are also worried that Gates - who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation - wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding. Gates, who owned 49 percent of Microsoft before it went public in 1986, sells about 80 million Microsoft shares a year under a pre-set plan, which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018. Gates lowered his profile at Microsoft after he handed the CEO role to Ballmer in 2000, giving up his day-to-day work there in 2008 to focus on the $38 billion Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months, amid pressure from activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management. Microsoft is now looking for a new CEO, though its board has said Ballmer's strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy. Microsoft is still one of the world's most valuable technology companies, making a net profit of $22 billion last fiscal year. But its core Windows computing operating system, and to a lesser extent the Office software suite, are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular. Shares of Microsoft have been essentially static for a decade, and the company has lost ground to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the move toward mobile computing. One of the sources said Gates was one of the technology industry's greatest pioneers, but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman.

Alex Wong/Getty ImagesIn a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, said that the U.S. has started using "final extraordinary measures," to stay below the debt ceiling. Lew said the measures will be exhausted no later than October 17.  Congress' failure to agree to a budget deal has led to a partial shutdown of the government for the first time in 17 years. While the White House and Congress continue to battle it out over the budget, there are concerns that this will lead to a stalemate over raising the debt ceiling by October 17.

High Frequency EconomicsThanks to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't be publishing its monthly employment situation report (aka "the jobs report"). For now, we'll have to make do with the data provided by the private sector. On Wednesday, the world will be paying particularly close attention to ADP's national employment trends report. ADP's numbers have long been considered a preview to the jobs report's private payrolls number, which is published days later by the BLS. However, economists have also approached it with caution due to its history of being inaccurate. But some have noticed that it has been improving as a proxy for the official BLS report. "[T]here has been a growing case for the ADP report to get more attention than it did in the past; its reliability seems to have improved since Moody’s replaced Macroeconomic Advisers as the compiler of the data late last year," said High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan.  "ADP’s misses have averaged 38K—without regard to sign—in the 11 months since Moody’s took over, down from 63K in the previous 11 months. Of course, that is just an average. Misses have ranged from -63K—with payrolls weaker than ADP—to +57K—with payrolls stronger than ADP. Last month’s miss was -24K, with the ADP series up 176K and private payrolls in the BLS report up 152K; total payrolls rose 169K." "Unfortunately, we will still lack the other labor-related data provided by the monthly employment report, such as the length of the workweek, average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate," said Deutsche Bank's Carl Riccadonna. "So while ADP will provide a reasonable substitute for payrolls, the trajectory of aggregate income growth (the product of workers, hours and wages) will remain largely unknown." Bottom line: ADP's report is not a perfect proxy for the the BLS's report. But it might just be the next best thing. The consensus expects ADP to report 180,000 payrolls added in September, up from 176,000 in August. Few market economists actually provide forecasts for ADP. Here is what some of them are saying: The ADP report will be released at 8:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday.
REUTERS/Bazuki MuhammadFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  There Are Two Fundamental Flaws With The Risk Parity Asset Allocation Strategy (The Wall Street Journal)  Many advisors have been in favor of using risk parity as an allocation strategy writes Charles Stucke, CIO of New York-based Guggenheim Investment Advisors in a new WSJ column. This refers to an equal distribution of risk among all the asset classes in a portfolio. But Stucke thinks there are two "flaws" with this strategy.  "The first flaw is risk parity's use of volatility as a measure of risk. Volatility can be a measure of risk if distributions are normal or quasi-normal, meaning, for example, that extreme events should happen as infrequently as normal distributions imply. Historically, this has not been true. Most financial assets move well beyond what is shown by normal distributions, so volatility cannot fully capture that risk... "Secondly, modern portfolio theory and risk parity tend to lead advisers to leverage portfolios based on these faulty assumptions of risk, which, in turn, persuades them to over-invest in fixed income assets such as bonds and other investments at price levels they may regret later to evenly distribute that risk." There Has Been A 'Consistent And Sizeable Overweighting To Corporate Bonds' Over The Past 15 Years (Vanguard) Paul Bosse, Brian Wimmer, and Christopher Philips of Vanguard argue that investors often pick an actively managed mutual fund believing "that the fund’s stated benchmark accurately represents that fund’s average sector exposure over time." But often advisors will move towards riskier market segments in search of better returns and this has meant "a consistent and sizable overweighting to corporate bonds, on average, over the past 15 years." They think it is important for investors to realize that "this corporate bond bias noticeably alters the risk profile of active bond funds from that of their benchmark," and this could lead to more volatility in their portfolio than they expect. More Americans Are Looking For Retirement Help (FA Mag) 63% of Americans that sought financial advice in 2013, asked for information on saving for retirement, up from 52% the previous year, according to TIAA-CREF's Financial Advice Survey.

I Worry About A 1913 Scenario With Dire Consequences For The Global Economy (Morgan Stanley)  Morgan Stanley's Joachim Fels is worried about a 1913 scenario and its impact on the global economy. "Why worry now if even the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 didn’t result in a de-globalization of economic activity and financial markets?" he asks.  "Well, neither did the Panic of 1907 on Wall Street, which preceded the final hurrah of the Golden Age of globalization and paved the way for the creation of the Federal Reserve in, yes, 1913. Following the 2008 crisis, central banks and governments around the world opened the floodgates to prevent a depression (and rightly so) and fuelled a powerful rebound in economic growth, global trade, asset markets and capital flows. Yet, one unintended consequence of QE and ZIRP was a rush of liquidity into emerging markets, which offered a seemingly successful growth model and thus higher expected returns. Fels points out that the emerging market growth model seems to face challenges. "A localization or renationalisation of investment has already taken place in euro area financial markets in response to the euro area debt crisis. Could we now see a similar move globally?"

REUTERS/Bernadett SzaboGeorge SorosBillionaire financier and legendary speculator George Soros gave a speech today at the Global Economic Symposium in Kiel, Germany, titled "The Future of Europe." In the speech, Soros declared the euro crisis over: The euro crisis is now over. This became official in the German elections where the rules governing the euro were not even discussed. Yet the system that emerged from the crisis is far from satisfactory. Mainstream economists would call it an inferior equilibrium; I call it a far-from equilibrium situation.  The euro crisis has already transformed the European Union into something radically different from what was originally intended. The EU was meant to be a voluntary association of sovereign and equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good. It has turned into a relationship between creditors and debtors that is by its nature compulsory and unequal.  When a debtor country gets into difficulties the creditor countries gain the upper hand. The rules they have established merely perpetuate this state of affairs. That is liable to be politically unacceptable and it has the potential of destroying the European Union altogether. Only the creditors are in a position to prevent this outcome but they do not seem to show any inclination to do so.  However, he also said that what has taken its place is only making Europe's nightmare worse (emphasis added): The Eurozone is now in a mild rebound led by Germany but the heavily indebted countries are lagging behind. The divergence is largely due to their higher debt burden and the higher cost of money. Since these are recurrent, the divergence is bound to get wider with the passage of time. What needs to be done follows directly from this analysis of what has happened. Recognizing the mistakes and identifying the misconceptions that have created the current situation is the first step; correcting them is the second. Only Germany can initiate the process because, as the country with the highest credit standing, it is in the driver’s seat. If a debtor country tried to do it would merely aggravate its own position. Admitting and correcting mistakes is never easy. In this case there is no shame attached to it because the situation was so complicated that it boggled every mind. Doing it would earn Germany the long lasting gratitude of the rest of Europe. Failure to do is much worse. It has created a nightmare in which the victims of the current policies have to live in their waking lives. The full text of the speech is included below. ------------------------------------------------- October 01, 2013 I shall take a holistic approach to the future of Europe. I have developed a conceptual framework, which has guided me in my decisions throughout my adult life. The framework is much broader than the financial markets; it deals with the relationship between thinking and reality. What makes that relationship so complicated is that the thoughts and actions of participants are part of the reality they have to think about. Their thinking serves a dual function: on the one hand they try to understand the world in which they live – that is the cognitive function; on the other, they want to influence the events in which they participate – that is the manipulative function. The two functions interfere with each other – I call the interference reflexivity. The cornerstone of my conceptual framework is the human uncertainty principle, which is based on the twin pillars of fallibility and reflexivity. The human uncertainty principle has far reaching implications for scientific method. It applies only to social phenomena and thereby it separates the social sciences from the natural sciences. Economic theory has sought to imitate the natural sciences, particularly Newtonian physics. Consequently my conceptual framework is in direct conflict with mainstream economic theory. The differences are especially pronounced in dealing with financial problems in general and the euro crisis in particular. Mainstream economics has pursued timelessly and universally valid laws whose validity can be tested by reference to the facts. I contend that the facts produced by social processes do not constitute a reliable criterion for judging the validity of theories because of the human uncertainty principle. I do not deny the possibility of establishing universally and timelessly valid laws – the human uncertainty principle is one of them – but I consider such laws too vague and general to be of much use in producing specific predictions and explanations. In any case social phenomena are easier to explain than to predict. The past is uniquely determined while the human uncertainty principle renders the future inherently indeterminate. That is not how Newtonian physics works. Mainstream economics sought to apply the Newtonian approach to social phenomena by introducing the concept of equilibrium. This required elaborate mental gymnastics. It started with the theory of perfect competition, which assumed perfect knowledge and ended with rational expectations and the efficient market hypothesis. By contrast I emphasize the role of misconceptions, misinterpretations and a sheer lack of understanding in shaping the course of events. I focus on the process of change rather than on the eventual outcome. The process involves reflexive feedback loops between the objective and subjective aspects of reality. Fallibility insures that the two aspects are never identical. That is where my framework differs from mainstream economics. Feedback can be negative or positive. Negative feedback narrows the divergence between the objective and subjective aspects of reality; positive feedback widens it. Carried to an extreme, negative feedback would lead to equilibrium; positive feedback would result in mayhem. In standard economics equilibrium is the inevitable outcome, in my framework equilibrium is one of two theoretical extremes. Reality ranges from near equilibrium to far from equilibrium conditions, but the distribution of cases does not follow a regular bell curve; it tends to cluster around the two extremes. The extremes act as “strange attractors” because people tend to use dichotomies to simplify matters. A situation can be considered stable or unstable. But people’s opinion can shift quite quickly. This leads to the “fat tails” observed in market volatility- that is inherent in my framework but not in standard economics. Using this conceptual framework I have developed a boom-bust theory of financial crises, which is the opposite of equilibrium. It consists of a trend that prevails in reality and a misinterpretation or misconception relating to that trend. The trend and the misconception mutually reinforce each other until they grow to such an extent that the misconception becomes increasingly apparent. Eventually an inflection point is reached where the trend is reversed and a positive feedback loop develops in the opposite direction. Boom bust processes or bubbles are only one manifestation of reflexivity and only occasionally do they grow to a size where they assume macroeconomic importance. There is also a reflexive interaction between the authorities and the markets. Behind the invisible hand of markets lurks the visible hand of politics. Both the markets and the authorities are fallible; that is what makes their interaction reflexive. While bubbles occur only intermittently the interplay between economics and politics is ongoing. We need to study the political economy where every event is unique instead of looking for timelessly valid laws. My conceptual framework consists of universally valid generalizations; therefore its usefulness in explaining or predicting the political economy is strictly limited. But as a hedge fund manager I have used it to develop specific theories about specific situations and my performance record testifies to their usefulness. I have followed the euro crisis closely ever since its inception. I have written numerous articles about it that has been collected in a book. I found my conceptual framework particularly helpful because the crisis is the result of a reflexive interaction between financial and political processes and combines historical, cultural, moral and above all legal aspects. That makes it so complicated that it boggles the mind. Misconceptions have played a central role. I shall focus on them instead of presenting a comprehensive analysis. The design of the common currency had many flaws. Some of them were known at the time the euro was introduced. Everybody, for example, knew that it was an incomplete currency; it had a central bank, but it didn't have a common treasury. Other defects were discovered only in the crisis. In retrospect the most important defect was that the euro exposed the government bonds of member countries to the risk of default. In a developed country with its own currency, the risk of default is absent because it can always print money. But by ceding that right to an independent central bank, the member-states put themselves in the position of third-world countries that borrow in a foreign currency. This fact was not recognized either by the markets or by the authorities prior to the crisis, testifying to the fallibility of both. When the euro was introduced, the authorities actually declared government bonds to be riskless. Commercial banks were not required to set aside any capital reserves against their holdings of government bonds and the European Central Bank (ECB) accepted all government bonds on equal terms at its discount window. This set up a perverse incentive for commercial banks to buy the debt of the weaker governments in order to earn what eventually became just a few basis points, because interest rate differentials converged to practically zero. This convergence in interest rates caused divergences in economic performance. The weaker countries enjoyed real estate, consumption and investment booms, while Germany, weighed down by the burdens of reunification, had to adopt fiscal austerity and structural reforms. This divergence was not envisioned by the Maastricht Treaty, which assumed that only the public sector produces disequilibrium. Then came the Crash of 2008. After the Lehman bankruptcy European finance ministers declared that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail but Chancellor Merkel insisted that the obligation should fall on each country individually, not on the European Union or the Eurozone collectively. That was the onset of the euro crisis but it took markets more than a year to react to it. Only when Greece revealed a much larger than expected fiscal deficit did markets realize that Greece may actually default on its debt – but then they raised risk premiums with a vengeance not only on Greek bonds but on the bonds of all the so-called periphery countries. By then those countries became saddled with much more debt than a third world country would have been able to accumulate. The outbreak of the crisis put the European financial authorities in a bind. They had to deal with the crisis in accordance with rules that were patently inappropriate to prevailing conditions; yet they couldn’t change the Maastricht and Lisbon Treaties because public opinion especially in France and Germany was opposed to any further steps towards European integration. Consequently, the authorities had to resort to all kinds of legal subterfuges to prevent the euro from collapsing. This made the rules governing the euro much more complicated than they would have been if they had been designed de novo. At the same time some of the changes that arose in practice, notably the risk of default and the bail-in of bondholders were gradually given legal recognition. This has put heavily indebted countries at a large and recurrent disadvantage, which has not been properly acknowledged. In this context the double meaning of the German word “Schuld” has played a key role. It means both debt and guilt. This has made it natural or “Selbstverstandlich” for the German public to blame the heavily indebted countries for their misfortunes. But that is not justified by the facts, except in the case of Greece. The Greek government had blatantly violated the Treaties, but the other debtor countries had played by the rules. Indeed Spain used to be held up as a paragon of prudent fiscal management. Clearly the faults were systemic. The responsibility for the misfortunes of the heavily indebted countries rests mainly with those who decided the rules that govern the euro, Germany and France foremost among them. But this conclusion would be stubbornly resisted in those countries. The euro crisis is now over. This became official in the German elections where the rules governing the euro were not even discussed. Yet the system that emerged from the crisis is far from satisfactory. Mainstream economists would call it an inferior equilibrium; I call it a far-from equilibrium situation. The euro crisis has already transformed the European Union into something radically different from what was originally intended. The EU was meant to be a voluntary association of sovereign and equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good. It has turned into a relationship between creditors and debtors that is by its nature compulsory and unequal. When a debtor country gets into difficulties the creditor countries gain the upper hand. The rules they have established merely perpetuate this state of affairs. That is liable to be politically unacceptable and it has the potential of destroying the European Union altogether. Only the creditors are in a position to prevent this outcome but they do not seem to show any inclination to do so. The defects of the currently prevailing situation fall into two categories: political and financial. On the political side Germany has emerged as the de facto hegemonic power. Germany cannot dictate to the others but the European authorities cannot make any proposals without obtaining Germany’s permission. Democracy flourishes in Germany but debtor countries stumble from one political crisis to the next. And the German Constitutional Court has emerged as the most powerful judicial authority in Europe. Since Germany, mindful of its recent history, did not want to play a hegemonic role, it is unwilling to accept the responsibilities and liabilities that go with that role. As a result Germany is reviled in some other countries while Germany feels unjustly accused of occupying a position that it actively sought to avoid. Contrast that with the United States, which acted as a benign hegemon at the end of World War II embarking on the Marshall Plan; subsequently it was acclaimed as the leader of the free world and enjoyed the lasting allegiance of Europe. Current German attitudes are also in sharp contrast with the attitude prevailing at the time of German reunification. At that time Germany became the engine of European integration in order to achieve that goal. On the economic front the austerity policy advocated by Germany proved to be counterproductive. Every euro of reduction in the fiscal deficit caused more than a euro of reduction in GDP – in other words the fiscal multiplier turned out to be more than one. The German public found that difficult to understand. The fiscal reforms introduced by the Schroeder government were successful; why should a policy that worked for Germany not work for Europe? The reason is that the Schroeder government operated in an inflationary environment and the current environment is deflationary. It took a long time for the European authorities to recognize this fact but eventually they did and they stopped imposing additional austerity measures. That relieved the downward pressure and allowed the Eurozone to hit bottom and the financial crisis to abate. The Eurozone is now in a mild rebound led by Germany but the heavily indebted countries are lagging behind. The divergence is largely due to their higher debt burden and the higher cost of money. Since these are recurrent, the divergence is bound to get wider with the passage of time. What needs to be done follows directly from this analysis of what has happened. Recognizing the mistakes and identifying the misconceptions that have created the current situation is the first step; correcting them is the second. Only Germany can initiate the process because, as the country with the highest credit standing, it is in the driver’s seat. If a debtor country tried to do it would merely aggravate its own position. Admitting and correcting mistakes is never easy. In this case there is no shame attached to it because the situation was so complicated that it boggled every mind. Doing it would earn Germany the long lasting gratitude of the rest of Europe. Failure to do is much worse. It has created a nightmare in which the victims of the current policies have to live in their waking lives. Now that the euro crisis has ended, Germany has emerged victorious. But it is a Pyrrhic victory that would be better to avoid. I’m glad that this conference, which is almost unique in recognizing the severity of the problems that continue to confront Europe is exploring the possibilities.
MSVG via Compfight ccSeptember car sales data arrived today, with the so-called auto recovery cooling down a bit after the summer's big figures.Â  U.S. automakers reported auto sales at the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.24 million in September, the lowest print in five months, according to Wards Auto. It was a pretty hefty drop from August's 16.03 million figure, which was aided by Labor Day sales. Auto sales may have disappointed last month, but it has still been an impressive growth year for U.S. automakers, with year-to-date sales up 8.1% overall.

APWhy is this man smiling?This scandal really seems like it should be a big deal. Republicans in Congress, including Speaker John Boehner, have been demanding an end to Congress' "special exemption" from Obamacare, which allows the federal government to subsidize member and staff purchases of insurance plans from health care exchanges. When House Republicans made their final offer to keep the government open on Monday, one of their two demands was the so-called Vitter Amendment to ban those subsidies. Now, leaked emails show that, as recently as July, Boehner was secretly working with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) and President Barack Obama (D) to maintain the subsidies he's publicly decrying. His staff even tried to set up a secret meeting with the President, under the guise of immigration bill negotiations, to strategize on the issue. Obviously, House Republicans will have to fire Boehner over this. How can you keep a leader who conspires with Democrats to block one of your key policy goals? It's hard to think how House Republicans could justify keeping Boehner now, unless their complaints about the "special exemption" have been purely cynical. That is, maybe they know the "special exemption" isn't really a special benefit for Congress, but a way of addressing a unique disadvantage that has been placed on Congress, without which staff compensation will have to be cut thousands of dollars from 2013 levels. And maybe they've been pressing the issue because they think "Congress is exempt from Obamacare" is a good talking point, even while they seek their own private assurances that the amendment they're demanding won't become law. Maybe the average Republican in Congress has been just as duplicitous as Boehner on this issue. Of course, that's not what I assume is going on. I try to assume, as a base case, that congressional Republicans are operating in good faith, and that if they're hammering on the "special exemption," that must be because they think eliminating it is really important to the betterment of the country. And I assume that Boehner must be screwing them by trying to cut a deal behind their backs. But if they keep Boehner around, I'm going to have to re-evaluate that.
FacebookBenjamin Serra Bosch, a 25-year-old Spanish man living in London, has become a symbol of his home-country's awful youth unemployment situation after posting about his life on social media last week. Bosch's Facebook post revealed that despite having three degrees, including a Master's Degree from the IEBS Business School in Barcelona, he was forced to leave Spain and move to the U.K. to look for work. Now Bosch is living in London, cleaning toilets for a living. We've embedded Bosch's post below: // <![CDATA[(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));// ]]> Here's a rough translation of Bosch's message: My name is Benjamín Serra, I have two bachelor degrees and a master's degree, and I clean toilets. No, it is not a joke. I do it to pay the rent for my room in London. I've been working in a famous chain of cafes in the United Kingdom since May, and for the first time today, after 5 months working there, I've saw it clearly. I have been cleaning toilets. My thought was: "I received distinction in my two degrees and I clean other peoples' shit in a country that isn't my own." Well, I also make coffee, clean the tables and wash cups. And I am not ashamed to do so. Cleaning is a very decent job. What embarrasses me is having to do so because no one has given me an opportunity in Spain. Like me, there are many Spaniards, especially in London. "You are a plague," I was told once here. And let's not kid ourselves. We are not young people on an adventure to learn the language and have new experiences. We are immigrants. I've always been very proud, I am not going to deny. Those who know me, you know. And I have to bust out a smile at customers who look over my shoulder as I am simply a "barista" (as they call it here). Some are so outrageous that it makes me want to pull out my University and master degrees and put them in their face. But it would not really do anything.  It appears that those titles now only serve to clean the SHIT that I clean from the toilets in the cafe. A pity. I thought that it deserved something better after putting so much effort in my academic life. It seems that I was wrong. Bosch's message has been shared and liked hundreds of times since it was posted last Friday, and The Daily Telegraph writes that he has become the voice of Spain's "lost generation." Bosch isn't alone in his situation. At the end of August the level of unemployment for those under 25 reached 56.1% — a record high. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that the number of Spanish people registered to work in the U.K. had doubled since 2009-2010, with many highly educated young men and women forced to take jobs in fast food restaurants and other low-paying positions.
APIn the first day of the first government shutdown in 17 years, Republicans in the House of Representatives have moved onto "Plan E." They plan to pass smaller, targeted bills that would fund the most visibly affected government services in the shutdown.  The House will consider three separate bills on Tuesday. Each would fund and reopen different portions of the federal government, including national parks, veterans' programs, and tourist attractions in Washington, D.C.  The White House dismissed the idea earlier Tuesday, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) called it "wacky." Republicans are "trying to cherry-pick the few parts of government they like," Reid said on the Senate floor shortly before 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  The closure of national parks, veterans' programs, and landmarks in D.C. are some of the most visible effects of a federal government shutdown. On Tuesday, for example, a massive group of World War II veterans stormed past a barricade to enter the shuttered World War II Memorial.  Republicans believe that it will put the Senate in a politically tricky spot — they'll be able to say Democrats, for example, are holding back funding for veterans' programs to protect Obamacare. The irony is that the government is usually funded in a piecemeal approach through appropriation bills, something the House didn't do earlier this year because Republicans could not reach intraparty agreement on the bills' content. The White House said late Tuesday afternoon that President Obama would veto the bills if they came to his desk.  "The president and the Senate have been clear that they won't accept this kind of game-playing, and if these bills were to come to the president's desk he would veto them," White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said in a statement. In response to that veto threat, Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, called Obama's position "unsustainably hypocritical." "How does the White House justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans, National Parks, and District of Columbia?" Steel said in a statement. "The President can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans, visitors at National Parks, and DC while vetoing bills to help them. The White House position is unsustainably hypocritical."  As always, a brief recap of the "ping-pong" between the House and Senate over the past 11 days on the continuing resolution:
Mario Tama/Getty ImagesIn his latest note to clients, Morgan Stanley head of global economics Joachim Fels relays an idea he says has him increasingly worried these days, even though, in his words, it is "no more than a tentative thesis that still needs to be fleshed out and checked for robustness." "In short, I wonder whether just as 1913 marked the end of first Golden Age of globalisation that had begun in 1870, 2013 may mark the end of our age of globalisation, which accelerated since the 1980s and 1990s after many emerging markets opened up to international trade and capital flows," says Fels. "To be sure, Iâ€™m not predicting the world wars, mass sufferings and economic depressions of the three dark decades following 1913, but I do worry about a creeping trend towards a de-globalisation of economic activity and capital flows." Fels points to the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies following the financial crisis, which caused investors to scramble into investments in emerging markets, a trend that is now reversing. The economist envisions problems down the road as a result, as he explains in his note (emphasis added): Why worry now if even the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 didnâ€™t result in a de-globalisation of economic activity and financial markets? Well, neither did the Panic of 1907 on Wall Street, which preceded the final hurrah of the Golden Age of globalisation and paved the way for the creation of the Federal Reserve in, yes, 1913. Following the 2008 crisis, central banks and governments around the world opened the floodgates to prevent a depression (and rightly so) and fuelled a powerful rebound in economic growth, global trade, asset markets and capital flows. Yet, one unintended consequence of QE and ZIRP was a rush of liquidity into emerging markets, which offered a seemingly successful growth model and thus higher expected returns. Five years on, the EM growth model looks severely challenged, as Manoj Pradhan and I already pointed out more than a year ago. Many companies in the old industrialised countries are repatriating production that they sent offshore during the globalisation frenzy, and investors who burned their fingers in the quest for higher returns in EM are reconsidering their decision to globalise their portfolios. A localisation or renationalisation of investment has already taken place in euro area financial markets in response to the euro area debt crisis. Could we now see a similar move globally? I hope not, but I wouldnâ€™t rule it out. Needless to say, a de-globalisation of economic activity and financial markets would have dire economic consequences for the global economy and markets overall, but would also redistribute wealth and create a lot of losers and winners, in my view. And large redistributions of wealth create conflicts within societies and between countries. This is what I really worry about. Surely our societies and governments have learned the lessons of history, you may say. The long-term optimist in me believes they have. But then again, back in 1913 at the peak of the Golden Age of globalisation, nobody had a sense of what would unfold. "Iâ€™ll stop here before I get carried away," concludes Fels. "After all, this is a tentative thesis that deserves more deliberation."

REUTERS/Larry DowningThe U.S. Capitol dome is seen from the House side on Capitol Hill in Washington after the U.S. Government shut down last night, October 1, 2013.The U.S. government is on a partial shutdown, the first shutdown since 1995. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
AP On the House floor Monday night, House Speaker John Boehner urged his House colleagues to pass amendments to a bill that would keep the government funded and avert a shutdown.  The amendments, he said, were necessary changes to Obamacare, including one that gets rid of what he called an "exemption" for members of Congress and their staff. "Get rid of the exemption for Members of Congress," Boehner said. "It’s a matter of fairness for all Americans." But new, leaked emails paint a different picture of how Boehner fought privately to maintain certain health insurance subsidies for federal employees under the Affordable Care Act.  The emails were first reported by Politico, which detailed how Boehner worked with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-Nev.) to preserve these subsidies that have become a source of controversy in Congress over the past few months. A brief history: The perception that some lawmakers and Congressional staff are "exempted from Obamacare" began when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) proposed an amendment to the Affordable Care Act designed to embarrass Democrats. It required that members of the legislative branch and their staff purchase health insurance through the exchanges. Democrats agreed to a similar provision, but there was a problem with the legislative language: It didn't offer a clear way for Congress to continue paying a part of its employees' health premiums, as most public and private employers do. The Office of Personnel Management has since interpreted the Grassley amendment to mean that the federal government may offer tax-free subsidies to help members of Congress and their staff buy exchange health plans. Many Republicans contest that legal interpretation, saying it has set up a "special exemption" for Congress not contemplated by the law. The proposal that House Republicans voted on Monday night would have ended those subsidies. This has caused angst among both Republican and Democratic staffers, who correctly fear that it would significantly hit their pockets. Boehner railed against the so-called "exemption" for Congress, but the politics of the ploy were better than the practicality. In July, Mike Sommers, Boehner's chief of staff, went through David Krone, Reid's chief of staff, to try to set up a meeting with President Barack Obama to find a way to maintain the subsidies. Business Insider obtained the email exchange (which you can see below) in which Krone requests that they come up with a different cover story than Obamacare for the meeting. "People will know we are going down there," Sommers wrote. "We can't let it get out there that this is for the [Speaker] and [Leader] to ask the President to carve us out of the requirements of Obamacare. ... I am even ok if it is the President hauling us down to talk about the next steps on immigration." Krone responded that the White House would love to say the meeting would be about immigration.  "I really don't care what it is about — it just can't be about what we know it is about," Sommers wrote back.  The meeting never happened. But it appears that Boehner's public reversal on this position made Reid and Democrats reach their breaking points. Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman, accused Reid's staff of selectively leaking emails. And he said there is not a disparity between Boehner's public and private positions. "The Speaker’s position is clear: He voted against ObamaCare, and he wants to repeal ObamaCare," Steel told Business Insider. "If the Senate Democrats and the White House wanted to make a ‘fix’ to the law, it would be their fix. The Speaker’s ‘fix’ is repeal. This is just a desperate act by Harry Reid’s staff to protect their own subsidy." A GOP leadership source accused Krone of pulling this kind of "sleazy stunt" — selectively leaking emails — before, pointing to a September 2012 story in The Las Vegas Sun after frustration with Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) about an online poker bill. Nevertheless, the revelations put Boehner in a tricky position. And the leaks are sure to increase distrust among the two sides, with no immediate end to the government shutdown in sight. Politico also reported that, at one point, Boehner "wondered aloud at one point whether he and the Nevada Democrat could quietly slip some language into a bill to end the problem without it receiving any public attention." The emails between Krone and Sommers are below: Business Insider
Americans are getting used to the fiscal brinkmanship that seemingly occurs every few months courtesy of the dysfunctional Congress. In fact, all of this talk about a government shutdown seems to be having no impact on sentiment, which is good news for the economy. "The Rasmussen Consumer Index, which measures consumer confidence on a daily basis, gained a point on Tuesday to reach 103.0," said wrote Rasmussen Reports today. "Consumer confidence is up half a point from a week ago and seven points from month ago, but is unchanged from three months ago." "US fiscal crises in recent years have been followed by political agreements in the wake of politiciansâ€™ bluff and bluster," wrote UBS's Maury Harris in a note published on Friday. "Surely, this memory has limited the public's initial response to the latest round of fiscal wrangling. The daily Rasmussen confidence measure and the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index have not shown signs of buckling yet in late September as the fiscal crisis started to dominate headlines. The implicit 78.5 Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading for the late September polling period was up a tad from the 76.8 reported for the early September period, albeit still under the 82.1 recorded for all of August and this yearâ€™s peak of 85.1 in July. (Note: The latest monthâ€™s polling ended after Sept. 24.) In past fiscal crises in 2011 and 2012, all of the major indices eventually substantially weakened." In terms of the government shutdown, duration will obviously be the key variable.Â  Specifically, the longer the shutdown, the worse it'll likely be to the consumer. "However, there is potential for a major blow to public confidence if the fiscal fracas continues past early October," warned Harris. UBS
Reuters/Eric Gaillard    This post originally appeared in the September 2013 issue of GQ.    Here are a few things Jerry Seinfeld and I have in common: We both wear sneakers far more often than grown men should. We both adore the New York Mets and thus subject ourselves to undue misery. And we both sit quietly for twenty minutes twice a day, attempting to calm our minds. Seinfeld, presumably, is far better at it than I am. He's been practicing Transcendental Meditation, or TM, for more than forty years. I've only recently taken it up. Transcendental Meditation, if you're not aware, is having something of a moment. Despite being 5,000 years old and in the public consciousness at least since 1968 (when the Beatles traveled to India, took up meditating, and were so mind-blown that they wrote the White Album), TM spent most of the past half century out on the hippie fringe. If people thought anything about it, it was that TM was weird and maybe kind of cultish. But a dedicated core of reasonable people have been practicing it all along, and their ranks keep swelling, so TM is now following the path of yoga—another import from India, once marginalized as a trifle for tempeh enthusiasts—into the mainstream, where it can safely be sampled by even self-conscious, risk-averse people like me. "You know how your phone has a charger?" Seinfeld said last year, during an appearance on Good Morning America. "TM is like having a charger for your mind and body." Russell Brand, who says TM helped him stay sober, calls it "a shower for your brain." And gray-pompadoured film director David Lynch—whose eponymous foundation is the driving force behind the recent boom in the popularity of TM in America, converting everyone from Oprah to Rupert Murdoch—says that his twice-daily meditations give him "effortless access to unlimited reserves of energy, creativity, and happiness deep within." But the name that jumped out most when I started looking at TM's fans was Ray Dalio, founder and chairman of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund. Dalio is a superhero of the financial world. And what the 63-year-old has to say about TM—which he started doing forty years ago, in college—is not ambiguous: "I think meditation has been the single biggest reason for whatever success I've had." This from the thirty-third-richest man in America.   The Hottest Women of the 21st Century  The 50 Best Things to Eat and Drink Right Now The Season's Best Wool Ties 9 Things Every Guy Should Have in His Pockets The GQ Hair Guide To Bald Grooming The 6 Shoes That Will Last a Lifetime

REUTERS/ Ruben SprichWhistleblowing just became a lot more lucrative. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced its largest whistleblower award ever today, more than $14 million to an insider who helped recoup investor funds. The whistleblower "providedÂ original information and assistance that allowed the SEC to investigate an enforcement matter more quickly than otherwise would have been possible," the SEC said in a statement. Under Dodd-Frank, whistleblowers can now land an award of up to 30% of the money collected when sanctions exceed $1 million. â€œWhile it is certainly gratifying to make this significant award payout, the even better news for investors is that whistleblowers are coming forward to assist us in stopping potential fraud in its tracks so that no future investors are harmed,â€ Sean McKessy, chief of the SECâ€™s Office of the Whistleblower, said in the statement.
We just learned that two longtime staples of the New York nightlife scene, MercBar and Pastis, are slated to shut their doors for good. Trendy SoHo lounge MercBar opened its red doors two decades ago, and has been a go-to spot for the fashion- and after-work crowds ever since. Owner John McDonald told The Wall Street Journal the bar's last day in operation was Monday, Sept. 30. It did not close for lack of popularity: The building is in need of repairs, and after 20 years in business, "I just had to pick a day," McDonald said. Pastis, the perennially packed French bistro in the Meatpacking District, will also shutter after 15 years in existence, according to Crain's. The restaurant filed aÂ notice with the state Department of Labor stating it would lay off all 200 of its employees on Jan. 1, 2014, and giving the reason as financial, Crain's reported. Pastis was the brainchild of restaurateur Keith McNally, who also operates Balthazar, Minetta Tavern, and Pulino's, among other trendy New York eateries. In April, it was reported that the restaurant would close for nine months for construction. McNally is reportedly negotiating for the space when it reopens in 2015, but no deal has been finalized, according to Crain's. We'll miss these two icons of New York nightlife, but hopefully new and exciting spots will take their places.
Rob WileAt least one "non-essential" government agency has survived the shut down. At least for now. We just got off the phone with a Department of Energy analyst helping us on a story. When we originally emailed the employee, who works in the Energy Information Administration, we weren't sure whether we were going to hear back — but had a hunch we might because the EIA's website remains fully operational. He said the agency has enough spare funds to keep going through next week. The EIA also mentioned this in a Tweet today: EIA/Twitter  A DOE spokesman did not respond to an inquiry about the exact size of the rainy day funds available. According to the Department's official shutdown plan, if the government is still shutdown after another week, more than 12,000 employees will still have to stay home (out of more than 13,000).  The EIA only gets to keep three.
Reuters/Srdjan ZivulovicOne investing style seems all on-the-edge flash. The other is slow and steady. Both can win the stock market race, but history shows one wins a lot more often than the other. Here are ways to decide which is right for you. Picture two cars driving down a three-lane highway. A red sports car darts between all three lanes trying to find the fastest possible way ahead. A gray sedan in the right lane steadily goes the speed limit. Suddenly a train whistle sounds and in the distance the barrier arm of the railroad crossing comes down. Despite the best attempts of the driver in the red car, he misses the narrow window and comes to a screeching, hair-tingling halt at the crossing â€“ right next to the gray sedan. The red sports car represents active investing, the gray sedan passive, or evidenced-based, investing. Active investors see markets as inefficient and believe that at any time some securities are priced wrong, enabling these investors to buy or sell at a profit. Professional active investors devote an unbelievable amount of time and resources trying to find that extra edge. They pour over company financials, visit competitors, study the latest economic releases and try to predict everything from corporate earnings to the direction of interest rates. Think of this as the extra wear and tear â€“ and stress â€“ that comes with driving the red sports car, weaving in and out of traffic and stopping and starting suddenly. Passive investors believe markets are efficient and that over the long run the price of stocks and bonds reflect the underlying value of those securities. They do not seek to beat the market but rather use index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) that mimic components of the market. For example, rather than try to find that next Apple or Google, they purchase large U.S. stocks or small emerging market stocks in one swoop. Using asset allocation â€“ picking the right mix of each of those slices â€“ they create a portfolio with risk exposure comfortable for them. The gray sedan drives at different speeds depending on the speed limit on any particular road. Data show that passive investing historically outperforms active investing. In the past five years, 75% of U.S. large-cap funds, 90% of U.S. mid-cap funds and 83% of small-cap funds failed to beat their comparable indexes. One reason may be stubbornly unpredictable market surges: Missing even just the top 25 days of market performance over the last 40 years results in you having 3.6 percentage points less per year than if you had stayed the course. For more on active versus passive investing, read The Investment AnswerÂ by Dan Goldie and Gordon Murray. Do you want to invest like the driver of the red car and gamble that you might beat the train to the crossing or have a horrible crash along the way? Do you want to invest like driver of the gray sedan, going slower but enjoying better odds that youâ€™ll get where you want to go on time â€“ but you probably wonâ€™t be early? Your answer will depend on whether you think markets are efficient and how great your risk tolerance. Follow AdviceIQ on Twitter atÂ @adviceiq.

Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesWal-Mart isÂ building a series of fulfillment centers for online orders as part of its e-commerce initiative. But one statistic shows just how much Wal-Mart is lagging behind Amazon online, according toÂ Shelly Banjo at the Wall Street Journal.Â Â  Amazon's online sales were $61 billion last year, while Wal-Mart's sales were just $7.7 billion, Banjo reports, citing trade publication Internet Retailer.Â  Even though Wal-Mart expects e-commerce sales to reach $10 billion this year, Amazon is still dominating market share.Â  Walmart has tried aggressive new initiatives, including recruiting Silicon Valley talent, acquiring start-ups, pouring money into its mobile app and improving its search engine. Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke said that not moving more quickly into e-commerce was his biggest regret at the company: "When I look back, I wish we had moved faster. We've proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn't move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce. Right now we're making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area."Â  Wal-Mart's total sales last year were $444 billion last year.Â 
YouTube / Margin Call Trailer The government has entered into shutdown for the first time in 17 years. As a result, regular economic data releases put out by the Department of Labor and the Commerce Department â€” for example, the monthly nonfarm payrolls report â€” won't be released. A lot of the datapoints that economy watchers follow these days, however, are put out by private firms, so investors will still be able to piece together a reasonable picture of how economic growth is progressing, even though the government has shut down. The most-anticipated government-released report in the coming days is the monthly nonfarm payrolls (a.k.a. "jobs") report, which is scheduled for 8:30 AM ET on Friday. On Wednesday, we get payroll-processing firm ADP's estimate of the change in total private-sector payrolls in September. "The ADP report has improved significantly as a forecasting input for private payrolls over the past year," says Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna. "Therefore, in the event that the employment report is delayed, we will be comfortable relying on the ADP series as a close proxy of September hiring." The Commerce Department is scheduled to release two economic datapoints this week: August construction spending, which was due out this morning, and August factory orders, to be released Thursday. While there may not be a particularly close analogue for construction spending in private-sector data releases, investors can arguably look at a host of non-government data releases to get a feel for the pace of U.S. manufacturing growth while the government remains shut down. On Tuesday morning, at 8:58 AM ET, Markit released the final results of its manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) survey, which tracks metrics like growth in production and new orders in the U.S. manufacturing sector. The index was unchanged at 52.8, suggesting that American manufacturing continued to expand in September at the same pace as in August. The ISM's monthly report on manufacturing â€” due out at 10 AM on Tuesday â€” also tracks metrics similar to those in Markit's PMI survey. The headline index from the ISM report rose to 56.5 from 54.0, suggesting that the pace of expansion in American manufacturing is actually accelerating. The Commerce Department is also scheduled to release August trade balance data next Tuesday, October 8, and August wholesale inventories data on Wednesday, October 9, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September producer price index on Friday, October 11. If the government is still shut down, investors can again revert to the Markit PMI and ISM manufacturing releases, which both track growth in imports, exports, inventories, and input costs. Furthermore, regarding trade data, ambitious economists can always piece together a report by compiling the stats published by the U.S.'s various foreign trading partners. The "new export orders" sub-index of Markit PMI release fell to 49.0 from August's 52.0 reading, suggesting that exports began to shrink over the past month. The "stocks of purchases" sub-index rose to 47.8 in September from 46.2, indicating that manufacturers continued to reduce inventories last month, but at a slower pace than in August. The "input prices" sub-index, meanwhile, fell toÂ 55.7 from 56.2, indicating a slowdown in producer price inflation over the past month. The "new export orders" sub-index of the ISM manufacturing report fell to 52.0 from August's 55.5 reading, suggesting a slowdown in export growth, but not an outright turn to contraction as the Markit PMI report indicated. The "imports" sub-index fell to 55.0 from 58.0, indicating a slight slowdown in import growth. Meanwhile, the "inventories" sub-index rose to 40.0 from 47.5, suggesting inventory levels were unchanged in September, contrary to the Markit PMI report. The "prices paid" sub-index rose to 56.5 from 54.0, suggesting that the pace of inflation is accelerating â€” also contrary to the Markit PMI report. Finally, retail sales are also due to be published by the Commerce Department next Friday, October 11. Perhaps the best proxy for this datapoint is theÂ ICSC-Goldman Store Sales Index, published every Tuesday morning at 7:45 AM by the International Council of Shopping Centers.
REUTERS/Lucas JacksonFabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs trader found liable of six counts of securities fraud, has requested a new trial. In August, the SEC convinced a jury that Tourre misled investors regarding a pre-crisis mortgage-backed securities deal. The New York Times' Susanne Craig reports that Tourre's lawyers have filed a motion citing a lack of evidence. They are asking a federal judge to give Tourre a new trial or throw out the charges against him. From the Times: Mr. Tourre received an annual base salary and bonus during his years at Goldman. His lawyers said no evidence was presented to show his compensation was linked to the transaction at the heart of the case, and in fact “the only logical inference from the evidence was that his bonus was likely lower” at one point because Goldman had a piece of the trade that lost money. The jury, during deliberations, asked about Mr. Tourre’s compensation and Mr. Tourre’s lawyers said the jury “incorrectly concluded” that the trader’s base salary was sufficient to fulfill the requirements needed to return a finding of liable. Tourre has been described by many as a patsy, a fall guy for Wall Street's pre-crisis sins. Though he worked at Goldman, he was a small cog in an economic machine that fueled a mortgage bubble (there are tons of "vice presidents" on Wall Street).  Still, the case became one of the government's highest profile attempt to prosecute those culpable for the financial crisis.

AP A visibly irritated President Barack Obama urged Congressional Republicans to "move on" from opposition to the Affordable Care Act and pass a bill to keep the government funded, on the first day of the first federal government shutdown in 17 years. Obama's statement, delivered from the Rose Garden at the White House, came following a meeting with Americans whom the White House says will benefit from the opening of health-insurance marketplaces Tuesday under the Affordable Care Act. It also came on the first day of a government shutdown because of disputes over funding for the health-care law. "This shutdown is not about deficits. It's not about budgets. This shutdown is about rolling back our efforts to provide health insurance to folks who don't have it. It's all about rolling back the Affordable Care Act," Obama said. "This, more than anything else, seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days. I know it's strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda, but that apparently is what it is." Obama hailed the opening of health-insurance exchanges under the new law, and he told stories of the White House attendees who flanked him during his speech. He also noted the irony in the government shutdown that he repeatedly blamed on Republicans — that it "doesn't accomplish their stated goal" of defunding or making significant changes to Obamacare. "They've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans," Obama said. "In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job." There's no immediate end in sight to the shutdown. On Tuesday morning, the Senate rejected a House motion to go to conference over the continuing resolution to keep the government funded. Senate Democrats pointed to the fact that Republicans have blocked their request for a budget conference 18 times since April, and they said they would only go to conference if the government is reopened. Obama urged Congress to "stop governing by crisis," saying it is "not worthy of this country."  But his remarks also didn't forecast a foreseeable end. He also previewed the coming fight over the debt ceiling, which Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said needs to be raised by Oct. 17. Again, Obama said he wouldn't negotiate for a debt-ceiling hike, and he urged Congress to "pay your bills." "Think about that. If you buy a car and you've got a car note, you do not save money by not paying your car note. You're just a deadbeat," Obama said.  "If you buy a house, you don't save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage. You're just going to be foreclosed on your home. That's what this is about."
Flickr/boetterThe familiar story about income inequality and the lost middle class often starts with bots and boxes. Technology and automation (often summed up as "robots") have destroyed routine-based middle-class jobs, widening the gap between the rich and poor. Globalization (i.e.: international trade, symbolized by the container box) has eliminated a swath of well-paid work, like manufacturing. But forget about technology and trade for a moment. There is a more human story to tell about middle class woes. It's a story about marriage.The Atlantic *** Imagine the Typical American Family: Married, living together, with at least one kid under 18. That family earned a median income of $81,000 last year, as Ben Casselman showed with new Census data. That's a fine income, and it's growing, if slowly, even after you adjust for inflation. But look closer at where all the money's come from in the last few decades. It's not the husband. It's coming from the wife. Marriage used to be a pairing of opposites: Men would work for pay and women would work at home. But in the second half of the 20th century, women flooded the labor force, raising their participation rate from 32 percent, in 1950, to nearly 60 percent in the last decade. As women closed the education gap, the very nature of marriage has changed. It has slowly become an arrangement pairing similarly rich and educated people. Ambitious workaholics used to seek partners who were happy to take care of the house. Today, they're more likely to seek another ambitious workaholic. Married workaholics both want to work—and, often, they do. Married women have nearly tripled their average workweek since the 1950s, absolutely crushing the working-hour growth of every other demographic... The AtlanticThe good news here is that women have the degrees, the means, and the freedom to work when they want to. The bad news is that the Typical American Family has only seen rising incomes in the last half century because of working wives. In America today, a healthy, growing family income is a two-person job. Just look what happens otherwise. The typical family with a stay-at-home wife/mom has seen incomes grow only 1 percent, after inflation, since 1980. But dual-earner households have seen a 29 percent raise, according to 2012 Census data.The Atlantic Working wives are the heroes of the Typical American Family in the last 50 years. The problem is that "typical" isn't quite so typical, anymore. Single moms or single dads, once rare, now lead 26 percent of all families, twice their share in 1950. This graph traces their ascent: The Atlantic... and this graph traces their descent. Median incomes among families led by single dads and single moms have flat-lined or worse in the last few decades, falling behind those of married couples, whether or not the wife is working. The AtlanticSingle moms and single dads are more likely to be poor, not only because they don't have help in the household, but also because they didn't have much money to begin with. In a strange twist, marriage has recently become a capstone for the privileged class. The decline of marriage, to the extent that we're seeing it, is happening almost exclusively among the poor. The lowest-earning men and women (i.e.: the least-educated men and women) have seen the steepest declines in marriage rates, according to the Hamilton Project. The AtlanticThe single parent crisis is concentrated among minorities. Single mothers and fathers, a rarity among white Americans, are common among minorities. More than 50 percent of Hispanic babies — an astonishing 72 percent of black babies — are born to unwed mothers, according to Family Facts. The causes of the single parent boom among minority populations is debatable. Sociologist William Julius Wilson pinned it on economics and crime, arguing that "high rates of [male] unemployment and incarceration meant that the local dating pool was populated by unmarriageable men." Another answer, from George A. Akerlof and Janet Yellen in a famous Brookings paper, suggested that abortion and contraception laws "[made] the birth of the child the physical choice of the mother [which made] marriage and child support a social choice of the father." If the causes are mysterious, the outcome is not. The decline in marriage rates among poorer men and women robs parents of supplemental income, of work-life balance, and of time to prepare a child for school. Single-parenthood and inter-generational poverty feed each other. The marriage gap and the income gap amplify one another. The marriage inequality crisis creates a virtuous cycle at the top and a vicious one at the bottom. It pushes educated and non-educated Americans into entirely different worlds. Between 1940 and 2003, college graduates "grew more likely to marry college graduates and high school dropouts grew more likely to marry other high school dropouts," Charles Murray wrote in a book excerpt published with The Atlantic. College grads are now more likely to come from college grad parents, more likely to marry college grads (more likely to marry in the first place), more likely to work, and more likely to produce another batch of college grads who will benefit from the same positive, centripetal tendencies that brought their parents together. This is the marriage crisis behind our inequality crisis. It is not complicated. It requires no regressions. It is the simplest math equation is the world. It says: Two is more than one.

APSheldon AdelsonNEW YORK (Reuters) - Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and prominent Republican donor, has lost a $60 million libel lawsuit in which he claimed a Democratic group spread a false accusation that he had condoned prostitution in his casinos in Macau. At issue was an article published on July 3, 2012 by the National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) on its website that sought to dissuade then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans from accepting Adelson's allegedly "dirty" and "tainted" money. It cited reports about an accusation that the Las Vegas Sands Corp chief executive "personally approved of prostitution" in his Macau properties. U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan on Monday said the article constituted protected speech and was not libelous. The accusation, which Adelson has denied, had surfaced in a wrongful termination lawsuit against him by fired Las Vegas Sands executive Steven Jacobs. It was discussed in an Associated Press article about that lawsuit, to which the NJDC provided a hyperlink in its article online. L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Adelson, in an emailed statement said the decision denies his client "the basic right of trial by jury," and that an appeal is likely. He also said Las Vegas Sands has a "no tolerance" policy for prostitution. "The statement by the National Jewish Democratic Council at issue in this case remains a boldfaced lie," said Wood, a partner at Wood, Hernacki &amp; Evans in Atlanta. Adelson, 80, is worth $28.5 billion and the 11th-richest American, Forbes magazine said this month, and had donated tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and organizations in the 2012 election cycle. He claimed that the NJDC article was intended to advance the group's political interests by "assassinating" his character. But in a 57-page decision, Oetken said Adelson failed to show that the defendants, which also included NJDC Chairman Marc Stanley and former NJDC President David Harris, acted with actual malice or reckless disregard of the truth. The judge said the expressions "dirty money" and "tainted money" were imprecise and could not be proven true or false, and in context constituted protected expressions of opinion. He also said the use of the hyperlink was proper, and that the defendant's reliance upon an article from a "reputable" news organization precluded a finding of liability. "Protecting defendants who hyperlink to their sources is good public policy, as it fosters the facile dissemination of knowledge on the Internet," Oetken wrote. "It is to be expected, and celebrated, that the increasing access to information should decrease the need for defamation suits." Adelson had sought $10 million of compensatory damages and $50 million of punitive damages. Oetken also ordered him to pay the defendants' legal fees. In a phone interview, Stanley said he was pleased with the decision. "You just can't bully people with your money, and Adelson was trying to bully us with a lawsuit to suppress our speech during the election," he said. "David beat Goliath." The case is Adelson v. Harris et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-06052. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)
CNBC screenshotSalon politics writer Alex Pareene got trashed by CNBC anchors Maria Bartiromo and Scott Wapner last Friday while making the argument that Jamie Dimon should step down from JPMorgan. [via Felix Salmon] During the segment, Pareene suggested that JPMorgan deserved the massive fine related to mortgages. He also accused the bank of being "corrupt" and "shady." "Any time you're looking at the greatest fine in the history of Wall Street regulation it's worth asking, 'Should this guy stay in his job?' I can't think of any other industry — If you managed a restaurant and it got the biggest Health Department fine in history and people would say, 'It's making a lot of money, only a little poison in the food,'" Pareene said during the segment.  When asked who he thought should take over the helm then, he said the bank was "too corrupt" and that "anyone should get a shot." Wapner jumped in and said, "Too corrupt is a bit hyperbolic."  Things got even more heated when Bartiromo made the argument that JPMorgan continues to generate billions in earnings and revenue. That's when Pareene accused the bank of making profits of shady dealings.   Here's an excerpt from their exchange on "Closing Bell":  Maria Bartiromo: Should we talk about the financial strength of JPMorgan at this point? Even with all of these losses the company continues to churn out tens of billions of dollars in earnings and hundreds of billions in revenue. How do you criticize that?  Alex Pareene: Well, I think a lot of their earnings and revenue we've seen have come from shady deals, that they... Bartiromo: Oh, come on.  Pareene: They have. Bartiromo: Name three shady dealings.  Pareene: Bribery in China. Hiring... Bartiromo: You shouldn't be saying things you can't prove.  Pareene: Well, the nepotism, hiring children of prominent Chinese officials is not something I just made up... Bartiromo: They haven't been charged?  Pareene: It's a fact. It's been in the news. Everyone knows about it. Bartiromo: What's the fact? What's the fact? Pareene: The fact that they hired children of prominent party officials and there's a spreadsheet connected to deals they were doing in China.  Bartiromo: I don't like spewing things that are not actual fact on this program. I really have a problem with that.  Pareene: Anyone can Google China and JPMorgan and see this. I mean, it was in the New York Times. It's not... Bartiromo: Oh, The New York Times! Oh, OK.

2012 U.S. Census data released last weekÂ doesnâ€™t look good for the middle class, with median household income, income growth, and share of the total national income all continuing to decline. Liberal think tank Center for American Progress published several charts on these despressing trends (re-posted below). David Madland, the Director of the American Worker Project, thinks that the trends will continue, barring major policy changes in the government.Â â€œMy expectation going forward is that median household income will be stagnant while the incomes for the wealthiest will increase significantly,â€ Madland told Business Insider. The recent decline of middle class incomes is because almost all of the economic growth since the latest recession has been gobbled up by the super-rich. Large leaps in wealth for the top 5% have masked declines in income for the bottom 95%, giving the appearance that the economic recovery has benefitted all parties.Â   Even in good economic times (such as 2001-2007), median household income stayed flat.Â These trends, says Madland, are 30 years in the making â€” the result of â€œtrickle downâ€ economic policy and the loss of workersâ€™ economic power to get higher wages.Â  â€œThe gist is that we need a big change in the direction of where we are going,â€ says Madland.
Carl Icahn was on CNBC's "Halftime Report" with Scott Wapner going over his recent dinner with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Wapner, as usual, got right down to business and asked Icahn how it went. "We had dinner at my apartment with a bunch of CEOs." said Icahn. "We had a commonality, we know the technology world. But the conversation revolved around the buyback, we pushed quite hard for it." Like Icahn said before, he thinks an Apple buyback is a "no brainer." "It makes no sense for this company with their multiples ... not to do a major buyback," said Icahn. "And there's another thing I mentioned ... the fact that you can borrow money so cheaply today. I don't know when we'll see this again. ... Apple can borrow money and buy stock at such a low valuation." Wapner took in Icahn's argument and said, basically, fine— your argument's good, but what did Cook think? Cook's opinion is, after all, what matters, but Icahn's response kicked the blame to the board, saying [most boards] are "spoiled people" who don't care about shareholders. After that, he admitted that when he brought the buyback up, the meeting might have gotten "a little bit testy." "The board is not appointed by God. They don't have the divine right of kings," Icahn added. Wapner kept at him. "Your use of the word 'cordial'" suggested that things didn't go as Icahn planned, Wapner pushed. "Did you leave the meeting thinking that they would continue to entertain the idea that you brought forward?" he asked. Icahn reiterated his points and said, "We will continue the discussion and the dialogue. ... I can promise you that I'm not going away before they hear a lot more from me concerning this." Wapner then asked Icahn if he would consider a proxy fight, to which Icahn responded, "Are you asking me to make threats on TV?" Without missing a beat he went on again about the importance of Tim Cook's independence and the problematic nature of corporate America's board structure. It's obvious Icahn feels very strongly about this buyback, and he said it time and time again. He also said that he had more options (though he didn't elaborate on what they were). What's more, Icahn is clearly on a major crusade against corporate America's board structure. He said he wants more people to follow him on Twitter so he can change things. America, he said, has given him so much ("though it may sound corny"). Wapner eventually got to the most important question, thankfully — what did everyone eat at dinner? Icahn has a personal chef, of course, and his chef's name (incidentally) is Tim.  BUT that was all we got — he shirked the menu question. We're upset about that, Carl.
Yields on U.S. Treasury bills maturing October 17, October 24, and October 31 are blowing out today. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg The chart below shows the T-bill curve. The green line shows the curve on September 3, when yields on bills maturing October 17 to October 31 were much flatter. The red line shows that by yesterday, these yields had risen a bit in anticipation of a fight in Congress over raising the debt ceiling, which the U.S. Treasury will hit on October 17. The blue line shows the curve today as yields blow out. It appears that in light of the government shutdown that went into effect today, traders are now anticipating a bigger mess from the upcoming debt ceiling fight than before. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg Note that the curve is now inverted â€” it slopes downward, whereas on September 3 it was upward-sloping. Yields on longer-dated T-bills are likely subdued relative to those on the front end of the curve because the market doesn't anticipate a drawn out debt ceiling debacle. Yet, as veteran bond trader @Fullcarry points out on Twitter, even a shorter confrontation that results in a technical default on U.S. government debt would cause problems: @IvanTheK you don't want any delays in payment at maturity in case you have your own payment obligations.
Next Tuesday is the fourth annual Big Picture Conference,  a gathering of some of Wall Streeter's smartest, most candid thinkers in one room to talk shop, markets et cetera. It all goes down from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm at the McGraw Hill Auditorium in NYC on October 8th. The day-long event is hosted by Barry Ritholtz (The Big Picture) and Josh Brown (The Reformed Broker) of Ritholtz Wealth Management, and they were kind enough to offer up a contest of sorts for those of you who haven't gotten your tickets yet. Answer the following question in our comments section below, and you'll win yourself a seat the conference. Here's the question: "What is your desert island economic or market indicator - and why?" "If you only had one single stock market, bond market, or economic indicator to navigate by, what would it be - and why that one above all others?" The answers will be judged by Brown, Ritholtz and one of the speakers, economist Stephanie Pomboy. If you need any more convincing, check out the list of speakers below. The most important thing to note is that Art Cashin will be there — which means you can have a beer with Art Cashin (this is awesome). Good luck everyone!

It's a great question. While the MBA — the Masters in Business Administration — offers variety and camaraderie, the CFA — Chartered Financial Analyst — offers precision and rigor. The MBA means you take a few years and go to school (part or full time) and the CFA is a 3-level test that requires years of solitary study (and sometimes solitary failure). We've evaluated the decision making process, and presented the argument for why getting your MBA is superior. Now it's the CFA's turn.
REUTERS/Remo Casilli Italian newspaper Ansa reports that leaders of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party say the party would likely support current prime minister Enrico Letta in a possible confidence vote tomorrow. Italian deputy prime minister and PDL member Angelino Alfano said his party should vote in favor of Letta, and that there are no divisions within the party, according to Ansa. PDL senator Carlo Govanardi said in a phone interview with Bloomberg that his "bias is to vote" for Letta, and that his fellow party members will also likely vote in favor of Letta. Italian stocks and bonds are rallying as borrowing costs plummet. The FTSE MIB is up 2.4%, while the yield on the 10-year Italian government bond is 4.46%, 10 basis points lower from yesterday's close. Over the weekend, Berlusconi tried to force a collapse of Letta's fragile coalition government by announcing the resignation of several PDL ministers from Letta's cabinet.
O.C. Lee/Courtesy of the National Trust for Historic PreservationHome prices grew by 1% month-over-month in August 2013, according to the latest Corelogic home price index, after growing 1.7% in July. This figure excludes distressed home sales transactions. which include short sales and REO transactions, in which a lender takes possession of a property following an unsuccessful foreclosure auction. Year-on-year, prices grew by 11.2% since August 2012. Including distressed sales, home prices grew 12.4% on the year, and 0.9% on the month.  According to Mark Fleming, chief economist for Corelogic, the fall in growth this season was to be expected as housing entered its off-season. Anand Nallanthambi, president and CEO of Corelogic added that in addition to normal seasonality, a sharp increase in mortgage rates has also been a cause for the slowdown.Â  "We anticipate moderate gains in home prices over the balance of this year, supported by the recent downward trend in rates and continued tight supplies of homes in many markets,â€ he said in a press release.Â  The five states with the largest declines from their peak were Nevada, which declined 41.9%, followed by Florida, Arizona, Rhode Island and Michigan. However, Nevada also posted the largest home price appreciation compared to other states.Â Â  Here's a look at the trajectory of home prices: CoreLogic
C-SPAN2 After a weekend of theatrics has led to the first partial federal government shutdown in 17 years, Congress is at the same spot it was on Saturday. The Democratic-controlled Senate voted Tuesday morning to kill the House GOP's motion to go to conference over the continuing resolution to keep the government funded, a plan that was hatched late Monday night by House Republicans. The Senate tabled the motion by a 54-46, party-line vote. That puts the House in the same spot in which it found itself Saturday morning. House Speaker John Boehner has the option to pass the Senate's so-called "clean" continuing resolution, or try to pass a bill more to Republicans' liking that they think could be a starter in the Senate. A House GOP leadership aide said plans aren't firm at this point. Here's a brief reminder of what has happened since Saturday, when the House came back to work after being sent a bill from the Senate that stripped language defunding Obamacare:

This morning, Milan awoke to find something a little strange. Just off of Via dei Mercanti, near the heart of the old city, a submarine has apparently pushed its way through the paving stones and damaged a nearby car.

Carl Icahn doesn't necessarily sound victorious after his one-on-one dinner with Apple CEO Time Cook. But at least he's not giving up on his quest for an Apple buy-back.

New York Magazine's Kevin Roose has a great profile ofÂ Sahm Adrangi, the 32-year-old hedge fund up-and-comer. Adrangi made "a couple million" in 2011 shortingÂ U.S.-listed Chinese companies, and now his fund has $250 million in assets under management. That's not a monster figure, but considering Adrangi's age it's pretty impressive. It's also reminiscent of Adrangi's idol, Dan Loeb, another hedge funder who started off young. Adrangi's distinguishing characteristics may be his Twitter presence. His firmÂ Kerrisdale Capital often tweets its positions, a move now echoed by more prominent hedge fund managers like Carl Icahn. From New York Magazine: Adrangi is curious. His approach tends to be more circumspect, more Canadian than an Icahn-style fireworks display. But he likes the brash nature of activist investing, the name-calling, the swagger-as-business-strategy approach. And though his professional demeanor is polished, heâ€™s still capable, in person, at least, of talking in Wall Street trader vernacular. People whose ideas he likes are â€œthe man.â€ People he disagrees with are â€œdelusionalâ€ or â€œfull-on retarded.â€ Heâ€™s been rewatching the YouTube video of a splenetic CNBC fight between Icahn and Ackman over nutrition-products company HerbalifeÂ­. (Icahn called Ackman a â€œmajor loser.â€) Adrangi took a small stake in Herbalifeâ€”choosing Icahnâ€™s long thesis over Ackmanâ€™s shortâ€”a shrewd move that got him name-checked in aÂ Vanity FairÂ article about the episode. Keep an eye on Adrangi. And read the full profile at New York Magazine Â»
AP ImagesSome of Wim Delvoye's tattooed pigs. We've heard a rumor based on a source who claims to have seen it that billionaire hedge fund manager Steven Cohen, who runs SAC Capital Advisors, keeps a live and very large pig with a tattoo in his 35,000 square-foot Connecticut mansion. A spokesperson for Cohen declined to comment for this story.Â  Apparently, the tattooed pig is actually a walking piece of art. Cohen is a huge art collector. Â His expansive collectionÂ includes pieces by Monet, Picasso, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Andy Warhol, according to a 2010Â Vanity FairÂ profile.Â  We did some research and the only artist known for inking swine is Belgium-born Wim Delvoye.Â Delvoye is also known for making theÂ Cloacaâ€”a machine that turns food into feces (a.k.a. the "poop machine").Â  Delvoye runs an Art Farm outside of Beijing and has been tattooing live pigs since 2004.Â Â His ink designs can be anything from Louis Vuitton "LVs" to Disney princesses. Â We're not sure what sort of tattoo design Cohen's pig has, though.Â  So how do you tattoo a pig? Well, the pig isn't awake during the inking process. Â Â  "To tattoo a pig, we sedate it, shave it and apply Vaseline to its skin," Delvoye said in an interview back in 2007 withÂ ArtAsiaPacific.Â  The tattooing actually adds value to the pig. Â According to an article inÂ Complex magazine, some of the pigs have sold for over $150,000. Â  We were unable to get a comment from Delvoye or his studio at the time of publication.Â  If anyone has seen the pig or is aware of the transaction, please email jlaroche@businessinsider.com.

ISMISM's monthly report on the American manufacturing sector is out. The headline index from the report unexpectedly rose to 56.2 from August's 55.7 reading. Economists predicted the index would fall to 55.0. Any number above 50 indicates expansion while a sub-50 reading indicates contraction, so today's report suggests that the pace of expansion in American manufacturing accelerated last month. The production sub-index advanced to 62.6 from 62.4, but the new orders sub-index fell to 60.5 from 63.2. The employment sub-index jumped to 55.4 from 53.3. At right is a full breakdown of the internals of the report. Below is what some of the respondents to the ISM survey are saying: Click here for the full release Â»
WikipediaYes, it's clever branding. But today's "Tea Party" is nothing like the real one.Over the past few weeks, along with many other Americans, we have occasionally expressed frustration with a small percentage of the people elected to represent us in Washington. Namely, the "Tea Party" Republicans who just shut down the government. Importantly, our frustration has not been with the Republican Party as a whole. When we disagree with policies advocated by either political party, we say so and explain why, and we do disagree with some of the policies championed by the GOP. But we disagree with some policies championed by the Democrats, too, and we're glad we live in a system with different points of view and checks and balances. But "checks and balances" is not what's going on here. What's going on here is that the United States government has been hijacked by a group of extremists who believe that their view of one pet issue is so "right" that it justifies shutting down the entire U.S. government in protest. This shutdown, importantly, is not just symbolic. It is forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to stop working, inconveniencing millions of Americans who depend on government services, hurting the already fragile economic recovery, and disgracing the country in the eyes of the world. It is not "partisan" to point out how outrageous and anti-American this behavior is. If a group of extremist Democrats shut down the government over one of their pet issues — gun control, for example, or a non-poverty minimum wage, or universal health care — the country would be justifiably outraged. And what the "Tea Party" Republicans are doing is no different. Yes, the "Tea Party" Republicans don't like Obamacare. And, yes, Obamacare is far from perfect. (We have plenty of frustrations with it ourselves.) But the way to change laws you don't like is not to shut down the government at the expense of the entire country. The way to change laws you don't like is to persuade Americans that the laws are bad, build a consensus in Washington, and then change the laws. Frustrations with Obamacare, by the way, aren't the exclusive property of "Tea Party" Republicans. Lots of Americans would prefer a basic national health care system to Obamacare. And they would certainly prefer it to the terrible status quo championed by the "Tea Party." (The U.S. spends vastly more on health care than any other country in the world — and our overall health isn't even close to the top of the charts.) But, unlike the "Tea Party," those who would prefer basic health care insurance for all Americans aren't shutting down the government to protest the fact that they don't have it. They're working within the system. The "Tea Party" Republicans like to present themselves as brave revolutionaries — a heroic band of modern-day colonists who are standing up to the tyranny of an oppressive government. They like to think of themselves as the 21st Century version of John Adams or Paul Revere. Please. The brave colonists who stood up to the English king in the 1770s were protesting something very specific: Taxation without representation. The "Tea Party" Republicans, and the small minority of American voters who support them, are not the victims of taxation without representation. The "Tea Party" Republicans are taxed, yes, but they are also very much represented.  They have made their arguments to the nation, and the nation has listened and disagreed with them. And now that the "Tea Party" Republicans have hijacked the U.S. political system to advance their own selfish pet cause, they are arguably way too represented. To be clear: The "Tea Party" Republicans are no longer even creating a pretense that their anti-American behavior is about debt or government spending — the issues they staked their last hijacking campaign on. Now, the "Tea Party" hijacking is based solely on their dislike of one law that many other Americans think doesn't go far enough. America is a democracy. In democracies, people disagree about issues. They disagree, they make their best arguments, and then they do their jobs and move on. The "Tea Party" Republicans aren't doing that. They're disrupting and disgracing the entire country over a single pet cause that America has already voted into law. That's not heroic. It's not democratic. And, despite what the "Tea Party" Republicans want you to think, it's also not patriotic.

Flickr/kryptoHEADS UP: The world's biggest economies are releasing their September manufacturing PMI reports. And this is our scorecard. All of developed and emerging Asia reflect improvement and acceleration, which is encouraging considering heightened currency volatility in the region. Even Australia reported that its manufacturing sector expanded for the first time since June 2011. So far, the only area really showing cracks is Europe, where the numbers in Spain, Italy, Germany, and Greece deteriorated. Later this morning, we'll get numbers from the U.S. where all signs point to growth, but decelerating growth.  Also, if the U.S. government shuts down as expected, the available economic information will be limited, making these PMI report something to be more scrutinized.

REUTERS/ Jim YoungEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve decided it would not scale back (i.e. taper) its accommodative asset purchasing program ("QE") until the economic data â€” such as growth and the unemployment rate â€” painted a rosier picture of the American economy. So it's particularly ironic that the government shutdown will force the Bureau of Labor Statistics to delay its monthly jobs report, essentially handcuffing the Federal Reserve's decision-making calculus until the government can agree on a budget. For September at least, "The Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases," the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement. Now it seems the very fiscal headwinds Chairman Ben Bernanke was concerned about at his September press conference (namely, a government shutdown) will deny him of the data he needs to make a decision when to taper the pace of purchases. Bill McBride at Calculated Risk explains what happened last time a government shutdown coincided with the BLS' monthly report: Back in 1996, following the partial government shutdown from December 16, 1995 through January 6, 1996, the BLS finally released the December 1995 employment report on January 19, 1996. A similar delay would happen this time if the government is shutdown on October 1st (the fiscal year begins on October 1st). So where does that leave us in terms of monetary policy â€” and the Fed taper? The jobs report will likely be late, but how late depends on how long a shutdown endures. The upshot here is that an October taper is increasingly unlikely. Would the Federal Reserve â€” which has been so painstakingly careful as of late â€” really want to freak out markets in the midst of a government shutdown and debt ceiling battle? If the bank is truly data dependent, tapering without good news (or news at all) from the BLS would undercut the central bank's "transparency" credo. Put simply by SocGen: "NoÂ data, no decision." Admittedly, after the September "no taper" decision, many analysts have now said that the Fed won't make the move until next year. Given the shutdown, that seems like that's a certainty.
FlickrThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) filed a temporary cease-and-desist order against Wall Street brokerage firm John Carris Investments and its CEO George Carris for allegedly fraudulently selling stock to customers earlier this year. [via NYPost] FINRA, the self regulatory organization for the financial services community, also accused the CEO of improperly spending the broker-dealer's money on tattoos, pet care, motorcycle expenses and firearms.  FINRA alleges that John Carris Investments paid over $590,000 for personal expenses of the CEO. The expenses were classified as business expenses, the complaint said.  According to FINRA's complaint [.PDF], come of the expenses included $10,554 at a tattoo parlor, $5,987 for pet care and $5,317 for motorcycle expenses.  The complaint also alleges that $6,790 was spent on "firearms related expenses."   Here's the full release (emphasis ours):  WASHINGTON — The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has filed for a Temporary Cease-and-Desist Order against John Carris Investments, LLC (JCI) and its CEO, George Carris, to immediately halt solicitations of its customers to purchase Fibrocell Science, Inc. stock without making proper disclosures. FINRA alleges that during May 2013, JCI fraudulently solicited its customers to buy Fibrocell stock, without disclosing that during the same time period, Carris and another firm principal were selling their shares.  FINRA also issued an amended complaint against JCI, Carris, and five other firm principals alleging additional fraudulent activity and securities violations. In the complaint, FINRA alleges that while JCI acted as a placement agent for Fibrocell, Carris and the firm artificially inflated the price of Fibrocell stock by engaging in pre-arranged trading and by making unauthorized purchases of Fibrocell stock in customers' accounts. FINRA also alleges that Carris and JCI fraudulently sold stock and notes in its parent company, Invictus Capital, Inc., by not disclosing its poor financial condition. In the complaint, FINRA states that JCI and Carris misled Invictus investors by paying dividends to Invictus' early investors with funds that were, in fact, generated by new sales of Invictus securities. JCI and Carris did not have any reasonable grounds to expect economic gains for Invictus investors. As of March 2013, Invictus Capital had defaulted on $2 million of Invictus notes sold to earlier John Carris Investments customers, did not have funds to repay them, and has stated that it may be required to use proceeds from its ongoing offering to make repayments. JCI continues to solicit new investments in Invictus – an investment that FINRA alleges is wholly unsuitable. In addition, FINRA alleges that JCI issued false documentation that failed to reflect the firm's payments for Carris' personal expenses (such as tattoos, pet care and a motorcycle), and failed to remit hundreds of thousands of dollars in employee payroll taxes to the United States Treasury. Under FINRA rules, the individuals and firms named in a complaint can file a response and request a hearing before a FINRA disciplinary panel. Possible sanctions include a fine, an order to pay restitution, censure, suspension or bar from the securities industry. The issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents FINRA's initiation of a formal proceeding, in which findings as to the allegations in the complaint have not been made, and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint.

Unclear exactly what's up, but gold is tanking today. You have to figure some folks went long gold based on fiscal concerns, so this has to be cruel to them. Kitco
It's an especially nice pay day for Warren Buffett. Today Goldman Sachs will give him $2 billion in cash and 13.1 million shares as The Oracle exercises warrants he bought during the financial crisis, says Bloomberg. Back in 2008 when the world seemed like it was ending, Warren Buffett gave Goldman Sachs a capital injection. For his trouble, the bank gave Berkshire Hathaway warrants to buy 43.5 million Goldman Sachs common shares at $115.Â  Here are the terms of the deal from a March 2013 Goldman Sachs press release: The warrant had provided Berkshire Hathaway the right to purchase 43,478,260 shares of Goldman Sachs' common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $115 at any time until October 1, 2013. Under the amended agreement, Goldman Sachs will deliver to Berkshire Hathaway the number of shares of common stock equal in value to the difference between the average closing price over the 10 trading days preceding October 1, 2013 and the exercise price of $115 multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrant (43,478,260). Just a fun fact about this: Buffett did his first transaction with Goldman over 50 years ago. He's been meeting with the bank's execs since 1940. Pretty wild. 
APSix hours after the federal government shut down for the first time in 17 years, a new Quinnipiac poll delivered the first warning sign for a Republican Party that stands to take the brunt of the blame.Â  According to the poll, American voters oppose shutting down the federal government to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act by a significant, 72-22 margin. And on another upcoming fight â€” raising the debt ceiling â€” Americans oppose using it to stop the health-care law's implementation by a 64-27 margin.Â  And in general, 58% of Americans oppose cutting off funding for Obamacare to tinker with its implementation.Â  All of these should be significant red flags for the Republican Party, which polls have shown will take the bulk of the public's blame for the shutdown. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Democrats now hold a 9-point advantage in the general Congressional ballot â€” that is, Americans said they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district over the Republican candidate by a 43-34 margin. That's the highest it's been all year. And approval of Congressional Republicans is at its lowest point in the poll's history. Only 17% of respondents said approve of the job Congressional Republicans are doing, compared with 74% who disapprove. That compares to a 32/60 approval-to-disapproval rating for Congressional Democrats and a 45/49 score for President Barack Obama. 55% of voters think gridlock is occurring in Washington because Republicans are "determined to block any Obama initiative," while only 33% said it's because of Obama's lack of skill to convince Congress to work together. "Americans are certainly not in love with Obamacare, but they reject decisively the claim by Congressional Republicans that it is so bad that it's worth closing down the government to stop it," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.Â  "President Barack Obama enters this standoff over the budget with an edge over Congressional Republicans in the voters' eyes."Â

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst A corridor is marked closed to foot traffic at the U.S. Capitol, as the current budget fracas and potential government shutdown unfolds, in Washington, September 30, 2013.The government has shut down. Historically, the stock market itself usually does fine when this happens. But some companies are disproportionately exposed to the government, which means a shutdown is bad for business. Goldman Sachs recently published a report listing the stocks of these companies. We pulled the 20 stocks with the most exposure. We've left out pure defense and health care companies, as many provide essential services that will remain intact during the federal spending freeze. In addition, several companies we have included also receive state and local funds, which aren't likely to feel effects in the near-term. It's also worth noting that many of these names appeared on our list of stocks vulnerable to the sequester â€” and many ended up doing fine.
Bloomberg TV The U.S. government has entered into shutdown, but it's no reason to sell stocks, says JPMorgan chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee in a note to clients titled "Not a thesis killer, and not a reason to sell." "Overall, markets have been down 0.2% from the start of a shutdown until the end, with the longer the shutdown, generally the worse that markets perform," says Lee. "70% of the time (12 of 17 times), stocks gained from the start of the shutdown to 30 days later (up 0.6% on average) — most of the selling took place ahead of the shutdown." Lee expands on his argument that the bulk of the government shutdown-related selling has already taken place: Is this discounted? The 2.5% decline into the shutdown (since 9/18 highs) ranks this as the 3rd worst since ‘76. The bulk of declines seem to come prior to the shutdown itself with equities falling a median 0.4% in the 15 days going into the shutdown (see Figure 1). Since peaking at 1725 on 9/18, the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.5%, ranking this as the 3rd worst decline into a government shutdown — the two others being 10/82 and 10/84 (1 day and 3 days, respectively) with 3% declines each. In 1982 (per media sources), it looks like Congress simply missed a deadline to vote on a new spending bill and in 1984, a new spending bill was held up due to various packages being attached to the bill. The average performance of equities into a shutdown, since '76, is a gain of 0.4% (15 days prior to the shutdown date). Notably, during the two years where stocks fell sharply into the shutdown (‘82 and ‘84), equities gained 11% and 3%, respectively (start of shutdown to 30 days later). Does this suggest that we have seen the worst of the selling? It is not clear, since this shutdown is only the first showdown with the debt ceiling still an open issue. In other words, investors are likely to sit on the sidelines longer. "We would be buyers of major weakness, even acknowledging investors need to be sidelined. We do not expect to see long-term damage to the economy from a shutdown (particularly one lasting less than 7 days) and most investors tend to agree," says Lee. "However, the issue is the negative impact on P/E multiple from the 'Washington discount' — this is a lingering risk, but as shown on Fig 1, stocks ultimately shrug off a shutdown. The bulk of the selling, for most years, has already taken place and thus, we would remain steady buyers of equities." Lee has a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 1775. Today, the index closed at 1681, so Lee's forecast implies an additional 5.6% upside for stocks over the next three months. J.P.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican bank is likely to close all accounts held by foreign embassies, following concerns about large cash deposits and withdrawals by the missions of Iran, Iraq and Indonesia, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The Vatican's financial watchdog, which examined the transactions in 2011, believed the embassies' justifications for the transactions were too vague or disproportionate to the amounts â€” up to 500,000 euros at a time â€” these people said. In one case, a large cash withdrawal was said to be for "refurbishment", one person added. Now the bank and the watchdog want to reduce the possibility that the Institute for Religious Works (IOR), as the bank is called, could be an unwitting vehicle for money laundering and other illicit finances. Four people with knowledge of the matter said the closure of the accounts was likely to be a key recommendation of a broad review that Pope Francis has ordered of the bank, whose scandal-tainted history has long been an embarrassment for the Holy See. The review is set to be completed by the end of the year. It is the thorniest part of nascent efforts by the world's smallest state to open itself up to more outside scrutiny. The process ostensibly began under the former Pope Benedict, but was thwarted by conflicts among Vatican officials and an Italian money-laundering investigation. The IOR is a private bank - currently with about 7.1 billion euros in assets under management - whose stated goal is to hold and manage funds for religious orders of priests and nuns, Catholic charities, Vatican employees, and other Catholic institutions. But the number of account holders has swelled to 19,000 over the years and diversified beyond the original categories with the right to hold accounts. Fewer than two dozen of the 180 countries accredited to the Vatican have accounts at the IOR; many Western states such as the United States and Britain do not. Reuters has learned that the Financial Information Authority (AIF), the Holy See's financial watchdog, wrote to the IOR in the second half of 2011 expressing its concern over several cash withdrawals and deposits by the embassies of Iran, Iraq and Indonesia, according to the people with knowledge of the situation. The transactions - which were registered at the Vatican border in line with Vatican and European Union requirements that amounts of more than 10,000 euros in cash or equivalent be declared at customs - caught the eye of the AIF because of their origin, frequency and amounts. Iran, Iraq and Indonesia are classified by international institutions and governance bodies as countries at high risk of financial crimes. The Holy See's regulators also thought the justifications for the withdrawals, including one that simply said "personnel", were vague, these people said. It was not clear where the money for the cash deposits came from. The Iranian and Iraqi embassies to the Vatican said they had no comment on the cash movements or the concerns raised by regulators. The Indonesian ambassador to the Vatican, Bahar Budiarman, said that his embassy takes out up to 10,000 euros at a time from its IOR account and that the money is destined for personal use and petty cash. For bigger amounts, wire transfers are used, said Budiarman, who has been ambassador since early 2012. An IOR spokesman stated in emails that the bank does not comment on matters concerning the AIF and that the IOR had no comment on the possible closure of embassy accounts. The AIF said that "it does not give details about cases it investigates and does not comment on the....review of the bank". The review of the IOR has gained momentum under Pope Francis, who became pontiff in March this year. In June, he created a special commission to advise him on how to reform the bank, and has not ruled out closing it altogether. "If &lt;Pope Francis&gt; pulls off a restructuring of the IOR and gives it real oversight and transparency, it would go a long way towards convincing people that he's serious about reform," said John Thavis, longtime Vatican analyst and author of The Vatican Diaries. The Vatican moved to improve its financial transparency in 2010. That effort immediately hit a stumbling block when Rome magistrates investigating possible money laundering froze 23 million euros held by the IOR in two Italian banks. The IOR said it had been transferring its own funds between accounts in other countries. IOR officials told Italian magistrates at the time the money would be used to buy German securities, back then a safer bet than Italian securities, according to prosecutor's documents seen by Reuters. The magistrates later unfroze the funds, though the investigation continues. Separately, AIF officials noticed in the summer of 2011 that large sums of money were moving several times a month in and out of the bank accounts held by the embassies of Iran, Iraq and Indonesia, according to the people with direct knowledge of the situation. Withdrawing and depositing cash is not illegal, and embassies may legitimately transfer money in and out of theÂ Vatican provided they offer sufficient details on the origin of the money and purpose of the transaction. But international financial standards require banks to carry out thorough checks on the origin of large cash transfers and on the effective beneficiaries to rule out the possibility of money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes. Checks are heightened if the transactions involve countries, such as Iran and Iraq, considered by international regulators to be at high risk for financial crimes, and if high-level diplomats are involved. Regulators working at the AIF at the time pressed the IOR for details about the transactions. The IOR replied, but referenced only the Iranian transfers and did not provide any further details about them, according to the people with knowledge of the situation. It did not mention the other two countries. The AIF dropped its inquiries, according to these people. One top Vatican official briefed about the situation says the response was "silly" and that the AIF should have tried to follow up. The AIF management has since changed. Earlier this year, Ernst Von Freyberg - a German lawyer hired in February to run the IOR - told colleagues that embassy accounts were potentially dangerous, and that he wanted to close them, according to a person with knowledge of the event. But the proposal was blocked by the Vatican's powerful Secretariat of State, whose officials feared the move might hurt diplomatic relations, this person said. A report by Moneyval, the Council of Europe's anti-money laundering committee, said last year that while the Holy See had taken steps to improve standards, more needed to be done. The committee, which carried out the review at the Vatican's request, is due to conduct a new assessment later this year. The bank is also coming clean on possible illicit financial activities. The Vatican has said it detected six possible attempts to use the IOR to launder money last year, and at least seven in the first half of this year. In one case, a prelate who had close ties to the IOR was arrested in June on suspicion of plotting to smuggle 20 million euros in cash into Italy from Switzerland to give to rich friends in southern Italy. The prelate, who will be tried in December, says he was not acting for personal gain. (Edited by Alessandra Galloni, Simon Robinson and Philippa Fletcher)
Taras Kalapun via FlickrNEW YORK (Reuters) - Finding an apartment to rent got even harder in the third quarter, as the U.S. apartment vacancy rate fell to its lowest level in more than a decade, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. The national apartment vacancy rate fell 0.1 percentage point to 4.2 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, according to a preliminary report by real estate research firm Reis Inc. It was the lowest vacancy rate since the third quarter of 2001 when it was 3.9 percent. Some 47 out of 79 markets that Reis tracks posted vacancy decreases. Despite the decline in the vacancy rate, a weak job market and stagnant wages have prevented a commensurate rise in rents, Reis said. While the average U.S. effective rent in the third quarter grew by 1 percent sequentially, and 3 percent year-over-year, the increase in rent was less than what would have been expected in such a tight market, Reis said. Effective rent is the rent landlords receive after months of free rent and other perks. "Demand has been so strong to push vacancy rates to such a low level, yet we haven't seen rent growth of the magnitude we would normally expect," Reis Senior Economist Ryan Severino said. With such a low vacancy rate, effective rent would have been expected to grow by about 4 percent to 5 percent year-over-year but was stymied by lack of job and income growth, Severino said. "If median household income is growing at somewhere about 2 percent a year, give or take, once you back out inflation how much money is left for increased spending on rent? Not a lot," he said. Net absorption, the number of apartments rented over those that are unoccupied, reached 40,392, the most so far this year and 54 percent higher than a year earlier. New construction that is expected to come on line next year may fuel a rise in the vacancy rate and could slow the increase in rental rates, Severino said. Over the past five years, the apartment sector has been the beneficiary of the U.S. housing bust, the economic recovery, high mortgage requirements, and a constrained supply of new apartments. Those factors have pushed down the vacancy rate and allowed apartment owners, such as Equity Residential &lt;EQR.N&gt;, Essex Property Trust Inc &lt;ESS.N&gt; and AvalonBay Communities Inc &lt;AVB.N&gt; to raise rents. Rising mortgage rates in the third quarter also dampened homeownership, forcing people to rent longer. The 4.2 percent average vacancy rate in the third quarter was down from 4.3 percent in the prior quarter and from 8 percent in late 2009. At 2 percent, New Haven, Connecticut had the lowest vacancy. Memphis, Tennessee had the highest vacancy rate, at 8.2 percent. The average asking rent rose 0.9 percent in the third quarter to $1,121.16 per month. The average effective rent was $1,073.29. San Francisco and San Jose, U.S. capitals of the technology industry, saw the highest effective rent increase, both up 2.2 percent to $2,043.02 per month for San Francisco and $1,685.72 for San Jose. New York remained the most expensive place to rent in the United States with an average effective rent of $3,049.37 per month, up 0.9 percent. The cheapest was Wichita, Kansas, at $528.95 per month, up 0.8 percent. (Reporting by Ilaina Jonas)

The decision was made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet hours after he said the government will raise the national sales tax to 8 percent in April from 5 percent in a bid to rein in the government's runaway debt.

Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Vincent Reinhart published a brief note minutes after the U.S. government shutdown went into effect. "Dysfunction is not new, in that this marks the seventeenth shutdown in the past forty years," wrote Reinhart. "About 800,000 government workers will stay home, as federal employees who cannot be paid should not work." Here's the key takeaway from the note: In addition to finger pointing to assign blame, expect: "In the back-and-forth of legislative action, the ball is now in Speaker John Boehnerâ€™s court," added Reinhart. "The heat will build on politicians from constituents who were furloughed, inconvenienced, or fearful of market consequences. That is why we believe the odds favor a short eventâ€”over in one week."
Flickr/functoruserA quick heads up. In addition to a day that will be filled with talk about the shutdown, there are four* key pieces of economic data that are coming out today. Via Calculated Risk: â€¢ At 9:00 AM ET, the Markit US PMI Manufacturing Index for September. The consensus is for the index to decrease to 52.9 from 53.1 in August. â€¢ At 10:00 AM, the ISM Manufacturing Index for September. The consensus is for a decrease to 55.0 from 55.7 in August. The ISM manufacturing index was at 55.7% in August. The employment index was at 53.3%, and the new orders index was at 63.2%. â€¢ Also at 10:00 AM, Construction Spending for August. The consensus is for a 0.4% increase in construction spending. â€¢ At around 2:00 PM ET, Light vehicle sales for September will be released all day. The consensus is for light vehicle sales to decrease to 15.8 million SAAR in September (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate) from 16.0 million SAAR in August. I will post an estimate of September SAAR around 2 PM ET. *Construction Spending is a government-released datapoint, so it may not be released due to the government shutdown. The other three numbers are collected and disseminated privately, so they are not affected.
Eurozone unemployment for August is out, and it's 12.0%. That's flat compared to the previous month, although the previous month had been reported originally as 12.1%, meaning that July actually represented a sequential reduction in unemployment for the first time in a long time. Bottom line. It appears the Eurozone unemployment is not getting worse, which is consistent with improving (but mediocre) data out of the region. Eurostat
EastVillage Images/ShutterstockWASHINGTON (AP) — Campers in national parks are to pull up stakes and leave, some veterans waiting to have disability benefits approved will have to cool their heels even longer, many routine food inspections will be suspended and panda-cams will go dark at the shuttered National Zoo. Those are among the immediate effects when parts of the government shut down Tuesday because of the budget impasse in Congress. In this time of argument and political gridlock, a blueprint to manage federal dysfunction is one function that appears to have gone smoothly. Throughout government, plans are ready to roll out to keep essential services running and numb the impact for the public. The longer a shutdown goes on, the more it will be felt in day-to-day lives and in the economy as a whole. A look at what is bound to happen, and what probably won't: ___ THIS: Washington's paralysis will be felt early on in distant lands as well as in the capital — namely, at national parks. All park services will close. Campers have 48 hours to leave their sites. Many parks, such as Yellowstone, will close to traffic, and some will become completely inaccessible. Smithsonian museums in Washington will close and so will the zoo, where panda cams record every twitch and cuddle of the panda cub born Aug. 23 but are to be turned off in the first day of a shutdown. The Statue of Liberty in New York, the loop road at Acadia National Park in Maine, Skyline Drive in Virginia, and Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park, home of Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, will be off limits. At Grand Canyon National Park, people will be turned back from entrance gates and overlooks will be cordoned off along a state road inside the park that will remain open. "People who waited a year to get a reservation to go to the bottom of the Grand Canyon all of a sudden will find themselves without an opportunity to take that trip," said Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service. BUT NOT THIS: At some parks, where access is not controlled by gates or entrance stations, people can continue to drive, bike and hike. People won't be shooed off the Appalachian Trail, for example, and parks with highways running through them, like the Great Smoky Mountains, also are likely to be accessible. Officials won't scour the entire 1.2 million-acre Grand Canyon park looking for people; those already hiking or camping in the backcountry and on rafting trips on the Colorado River will be able to complete their trips. The care and feeding of the National Zoo's animals will all go on as usual. The shutdown won't affect Ellis Island or the Washington Monument because they are already closed for repairs. ___ THIS: The Board of Veterans Appeals will stop issuing rulings, meaning decisions about some disability claims by veterans will wait even longer than usual. Interments at national cemeteries will slow. If a shutdown drags on for weeks, disability and pension payments may be interrupted. BUT NOT THIS: Most Department of Veterans Affairs services will continue; 95 percent of staff are either exempted from a shutdown or have the budget to keep paying them already in place. The department's health programs get their money a year in advance, so veterans can still see their doctor, get prescriptions filled and visit fully operational VA hospitals and outpatient clinics. Claims workers can process benefit payments until late in October, when that money starts to run out. ___ THIS: New patients won't be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, including 255 trials for cancer patients; care will continue for current patients. Federal medical research will be curtailed and the government's ability to detect and investigate disease outbreaks will be harmed. Grant applications will be accepted but not dealt with. BUT NOT THIS: The show goes on for President Barack Obama's health care law. Tuesday heralds the debut of health insurance markets across the country, which begin accepting customers for coverage that begins in January. Core elements of the law are an entitlement, like Social Security, so their flow of money does not depend on congressional appropriations. That's why Republicans have been trying explicitly to starve the law of money. An impasse in approving a federal budget has little effect on Obamacare. As for NIH operations, reduced hospital staff at the NIH Clinical Center will care for current patients, and research animals will get their usual care. ___ THIS: Most routine food inspections by the Food and Drug Administration will be suspended. BUT NOT THIS: Meat inspection, done by the Agriculture Department, continues. The FDA will still handle high-risk recalls. ___ THIS: Complaints from airline passengers to the government will fall on deaf ears. The government won't be able to do new car safety testing and ratings or handle automobile recall information. Internal Transportation Department investigations of waste and fraud will be put on ice, and progress will be slowed on replacing the country's radar-based air traffic system with GPS-based navigation. Most accident investigators who respond to air crashes, train collisions, pipeline explosions and other accidents will be furloughed but could be called back if needed. Kristie Greco, speaking for the Federal Aviation Administration, said nearly 2,500 safety office personnel will be furloughed but may be called back incrementally over the next two weeks. The union representing aviation safety inspectors said it was told by FAA Administrator Michael Huerta that nearly 3,000 inspectors will be off work. Greco did not confirm that. BUT NOT THIS: Air traffic controllers and many of the technicians who keep air traffic equipment working will remain on the job. Amtrak says it can continue normal operations for a while, relying on ticket revenue, but will suffer without federal subsidies over the longer term. FAA employees who make grants to airports, most Federal Highway Administration workers and federal bus and truck safety inspectors will also stay on the job because they are paid with user fees. Railroad and pipeline safety inspectors will also remain at work. ___ THIS: About half the Defense Department's civilian employees will be furloughed. BUT NOT THIS: The 1.4 million active-duty military personnel stay on duty and under a last-minute bill, they should keep getting paychecks on time. Most Homeland Security agents and border officers, as well as other law enforcement agents and officers, keep working. ___ THIS: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. It provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children. BUT NOT THIS: School lunches and breakfasts will continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will still be distributed. ___ THIS: A shutdown that lasts two weeks or more would probably start to slow an already sluggish economy, analysts say. Closures of national parks would hurt hotels, restaurants and other tourism-related businesses. And federal workers who lost pay would spend less, thereby curbing economic growth. A three-week shutdown would slow the economy's annual growth rate in the October-December quarter by up to 0.9 of a percentage point, Goldman Sachs has estimated. If so, that could mean a growth rate of 1.6 percent, compared with the 2.5 percent that many economists now forecast. BUT NOT THIS: Little impact on the economy if the shutdown only lasts a few days. ___ THIS: Economic data will be interrupted as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ceases almost all operations. This will leave the stock market without some of the benchmark economic indicators that drive the market up or down. The key September jobs report, due Friday, could still be released on time if the White House authorizes that, but that's not been determined. Statistical gathering also is being interrupted at the Commerce Department and Census Bureau. This means the government won't come out on time with its monthly report on construction spending Tuesday or a factory orders report Thursday. BUT NOT THIS: The weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits is still expected Thursday. The Treasury Department's daily report on government finances will be released normally and government debt auctions are to proceed as scheduled. And at Commerce, these functions continue, among others: weather and climate observation, fisheries law enforcement and patent and trademark application processing. ___ THIS: Some passport services located in federal buildings might be disrupted — only if those buildings are forced to close because of a disruption in building support services. BUT NOT THIS: Except in those instances, passport and visas will be handled as usual, both at home and abroad. These activities of the Bureau of Consular Affairs are fully supported by user fees instead of appropriated money, so are not affected. As well, the government will keep handling green card applications. ___ THIS: The Federal Housing Administration, which insures about 15 percent of new loans for home purchases, will approve fewer loans for its client base — borrowers with low to moderate income — because of reduced staff. Only 67 of 349 employees will keep working. The agency will focus on single-family homes during a shutdown, setting aside loan applications for multi-family dwellings. The Housing and Urban Development Department won't make additional payments to the nation's 3,300 public housing authorities, but the agency estimates that most of them have enough money to keep giving people rental assistance until the end of October. BUT NOT THIS: It will be business as usual for borrowers seeking loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together own or guarantee nearly half of all U.S. mortgages and 90 percent of new ones. ___ THIS: Possible delays in processing new disability applications. BUT NOT THIS: Social Security and Medicare benefits still keep coming. __ Associated Press writers Sam Hananel, Matthew Daly, Joan Lowy, Kevin Freking, Hope Yen, Lauran Neergaard, Andrew Miga, Deb Riechmann, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Lolita C.

It might take a financial market freakout before Congress comes together to get a deal. And if that's the case, then the action today isn't helping. Not only are markets up around the world, US futures have been rising this morning over the last couple of hours. There was selling on Monday, once it became clear that a shutdown would happen, but since then, things have been calm or even bullish. Here's S&amp;P futures, via FinViz: FinViz
FlickrFor the European economy, the September economic data looks mediocre at best. And that's a bit worrisome, given that starting this summer there were signs that Europe was starting to turn the corner and grow again. Is the recovery already fizzling? Today's manufacturing PMI data was soggy across the board. France remains in contraction. Italian, German, and Spanish numbers all showed "growth" but were weaker than in August. Meanwhile, there's some fresh employment data that's also cause for worry. The Italian unemployment rate came in at 12.2% vs expectations of 12.0%, per ForexLive. German jobless claims also rose in September vs. expectations of a drop. None of this is decisively bad. But taken together it paints a picture of a halting recovery at best.
The German manufacturing sector is growing, but the pace of growth in September was slower than it was in August, according to the latest PMI release. This snap summary tells the story. Markit
The latest PMI report confirms that the French Manufacturing industry continues to be in a state of poor growth. The index came in at just 49.8, barely up from 49.7, representing ongoing contraction at a time when most European countries are at least seeing some growth. Here's the snap summary. Markit
According to the latest PMI report, the Italian manufacturing sector is remaining in growth, but the pace of the growth in September was a little slower than it was in August. The headline number was 50.8, down slightly from 51.3. Here's the snap summary. Markit
Well, we're less than 4 hours into the Federal Government Shutdown — the first one in 17 years — and so far markets don't care. Things were red on Monday, once it became obvious that this would happen. But so far today the mood is meh. Asian stocks finished higher. European stocks are higher: Italy is up 0.7%. Germany is up 0.3%. And US futures are modestly higher. Here's a look at overnight futures. You can see the lack of drama. FinViz Until this becomes a big, drawn out thing, there's no good reason to freak out.
A level of mediocre growth continues in peripheral Europe. Spanish manufacturing, as measured by the September PMI report, remains in growth mode. The index came in at 50.7, down from 51.1, according to Markit. Although this is a tiny backslide, this represents ongoing economic expansion,Â  although albeit from a slightly slower pace than the month before. Here's the quick summary. Markit
APHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) gave a strange 73-second press conference in which he took only two questions and did not mention the fact that the federal government had begun partially shutting down an hour earlier. Boehner delivered a brief statement after the House of Representatives voted to go to conference with the Senate over the continuing resolution that temporarily keeps the government funded. "The House has made its position known very clearly," Boehner said in his statement, flanked by other members of the House GOP leadership team. "We believe we should fund government, and we think there ought to basic fairness for all Americans under Obamacare.Â The Senate has continued to reject our offers, but under the Constitution, there's a way to resolve this problem â€” and that is to go to conference and talk through your differences. And I would hope that the Senate would accept our offer to go to conference and discuss this so that we can resolve this for the American people." He then opened it up for questions. First question: If it comes to it, will you pass the Senate's so-called "clean" CR that doesn't make any alterations to Obamacare? Boehner repeated that the House would try to resolve the party differences through conference committee.Â  He was then asked what he would say to the 800,000 federal employees who would be affected by the government shutdown. Boehner evaded the question.Â  "The House has voted to keep the government open, but we also want basic fairness under Obamacare," he said. Boehner then walked away from the microphones. "OK, we waited forÂ that?" Fox News' Bret Baier said after Boehner finished his press conference. "That was not a lot." Added Fox News analyst Juan Williams: "He is tired, and he is frustrated. Something's going on with John Boehner."
Mike Nudelman/Business Insider The White House made it official 15 minutes early: The federal government shut down for the first time in 17 years at midnight on Tuesday.Â  At 11:45 p.m. ET on Monday, the Office of Management and Budget offered guidance for federal agencies to begin preparations for a partial government shutdown.Â  "Unfortunately, we do not have a clear indication that Congress will act in time for the President to sign a continuing resolution before the end of the day tomorrow, October 1, 2013," OMB Director Sylvia Burwell wrote.Â  "We urge Congress to act quickly to pass a Continuing Resolution to provide a short-term bridge that ensures sufficient time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year, and to restore the operation of critical public services and programs that will be impacted by a lapse in appropriations." The White House's move came after a night of continued ping-pong between the House and Senate failed to produce a bill that avoided a shutdown.Â  A brief rundown of what has transpired over the past 10 days: The full OMB memo is below: OMB shutdown memo
