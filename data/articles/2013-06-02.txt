@deeCNBCAsian markets are digesting what economists see as a disappointing Chinese HSBC manufacturing PMI report. So far, the markets are taking it in stride. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite are each up 0.5%, reports CNBC's Deirdre Wang Morris. Elsewhere, markets are in the red but off of their lows.  Korea's Kospi is down 0.1%.  Australia's S&amp;P/ASX is down 0.1%. Japan is leading the way lower, down 2.1%.

Based on recent moves in the stock and bond markets, the answer to that question seems to be yes. This week, we'll get the first round of May economic data including the crucial jobs report. By the end of the week, we should know if the economy is really slowing in Q2. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update Friday really freaked some people out as the stock market plunged during the last few minutes of the trading session. The chart gurus noted the manifestation of the Hindenburg Omen: a series of technical indicators that some believe precede a market crash. Morgan Stanley analysts note that some craziness should be expected as the markets digest rising interest rates. "Transition periods can be very confusing, as the correlation (between stocks and bonds) becomes unstable." We asked Peter Costa, President of Empire Executions, for his take on what'll drive the week. Watch:
Yepoka Yeebo / Business InsiderRunning through a courtyard behind Beijing's Forbidden City.On Friday, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that the country's official manufacturing purchasing managers index unexpectedly climbed to 50.8 in May from 50.6 in April. Economists were expecting the number to fall to 50.0. Moments ago, we learned that the unofficial PMI report, which is compiled privately by HSBC and Markit, fell to 49.2 from 50.4 a month ago. It's worth noting that the unofficial report has greater exposure to small and medium-sized enterprises, which may be having a tougher time than its larger competitors. Still, the direction of the NBS number conflicts directionally with not just China, but South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. We don't claim to be experts at this.Â  But surely, these numbers will raise some eyebrows as the aggregate data out of Asia looks more bad than good. Here's some China commentary from the May PMI reports: South Korea PMI (51.1, down from 52.6 in April): China HSBC PMI (49.2, down from 50.4 in April): Taiwan PMI (47.1, down from 50.7 in April): Vietnam PMI (48.8, down from 51.0 in April):
MarkitChina's unofficial HSBC manufacturing PMI report is out and its disappointing. The headline number fell to 49.2 from 50.4 a month ago.  This was worse than economists' expectation fo 49.6. A reading below 50 signals contraction. Here are the key points from Markit: From HSBC's Hongbin Qu: “The downward revision of the final HSBC China Manufacturing PMI suggests a marginal weakening of manufacturing activities towards the end of May, thanks to deteriorating domestic demand conditions. With persisting external headwinds, Beijing needs to boost domestic demand to avoid a further deceleration of manufacturing output growth and its negative impact on the labour market. The new leaders should strike a delicate balance between reform and growth.” On Friday, we learned that China's official PMI report unexpectedly climbed to 50.8 from 50.6 in April.  Economists were looking for a decline to 50.0. All of this comes on renewed fears that China is slowing down again. China's HSBC PMI report has a greater weight toward small and medium sized enterprises, which tend to be more sensitive to economic swings.
Emerging market (EM) assets â€“ currencies, debt, and stocks â€“ all had a pretty terrible month in May. Poor performance in emerging markets was so pronounced during the month of May alone that several Wall Street shops are now out with big calls declaring the "end of the bull market." However, despite the wave of negative sentiment that has hit emerging markets, macro hedge funds were in there buying up EM last month. "Based on our exposure analysis, Macros bought EM exposure to the highest since October 2011, while maintaining their net long positions in [Europe, Australasia, and the Far East]," writes BofA Merrill Lynch analystÂ Stephen Suttmeier in the investment bank's latest Hedge Fund Monitor report. It looks like either the macro funds are taking a bath on their increased exposure to EM, or they see the latest movements in the market as a good buying opportunity.

The sad, painful trading in Japan continues, as the new week begins. In early trading, the Nikkei is down 2.3%. Nikkei.com Less than two weeks ago, the Nikkei was around 16,000. This decline is one of the big shakeups we've seen in markets lately, which includes the big beating taken by emerging market currencies and bonds, as well as the back-up in U.S. Treasuries. Meanwhile, all night, we're getting manufacturing data from around the world, which we're covering here. Click here for a deep dive into the Emerging Market decline &gt;
MarkitThe South Korea's manufacturing PMI slipped to 51.1 in May, down from 52.6 in April. "Export sales rose for a fifth successive month, but at a modest pace that was the slowest since January," wrote Markit in its report. "The US remained a source of export growth, but demand from China was reported to have suffered." Here are some key points via Markit: From HSBC's Ronald Man: “Korea's manufacturing conditions indicate that a broader global rebound is required to drive Korea's recovery. Because external conditions remain fragile, domestic demand needs to strengthen further to support growth. This may support the Bank of Korea's surprise rate cut in May. Looking ahead, should global economic activity fail to pick up meaningfully as we expect, this may prompt policymakers in Seoul to deliver more easing measures.” South Korea is a key exporter to mainland Asia, so it's a key bellwether of what's going on in China. Recently, economists have been concerned about the negative effects of Japan's weak yen policy. "A number of companies added that the weakness of the yen was improving the competitiveness of Japanese rival manufacturers," said Markit.  "A weaker yen did, however, help to reduce the price of imported goods from Japan. With copper, oil and raw material prices in general reported to have deteriorated, overall input costs were lowered to the greatest degree since July 2005."
makitanaka  on twitterNo one has died yet as a result of radiation exposure from the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown, according to a new UN report. So far, it's not even clear if anyone has gotten sick,Â although other studies haveÂ shown evidence some still could. "Radiation exposure following the nuclear accident at Fukushima-Daiichi did not cause any immediate health effects," the report, released Friday, says. "It is unlikely to be able to attribute any health effects in the future among the general public and the vast majority of workers." Between 15,000 and 20,000 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that caused nuclear cores in multiple reactors to overheat, causing the release of radioactive fallout. This is not to say there still aren't problems at the plant. As of April it was leaking radioactive water into the soil, and an investigation last summer showed regulators, along with plant operator Tepco, had failed to carry out basic safety checks. Plus, since the accident, Fukushimaâ€™s population has fallen by more than 60,000. But it may be further proof for those like Brian Eno who believe the Fukushima situation actually shows why we should be using more nuclear power: The absolute level of mishaps are low, and even when something does go wrong, the lasting damage appears minimal.
Daniel Munoz/REUTERSAustralia's May manufacturing PMI report is out. The headline number came in at 43.8, up from 36.7 in April. While this represents significant month-over-month improvement, the sub-50 reading signals contraction. "No manufacturing sub-sectors expanded in May," wrote the Australia Industry Group, who produces the report. "May marks the 23rd consecutive month of manufacturing contraction." Australia has struggled to regain its footing as its emerging markets trading partners slowed down in the wake of the global financial crisis. Here are some bullets via AiG:
Reuters/ Steve MarcusWall Street Journal's Jenny Strasburg reports SAC Capital clients are set to pull $3.5 billion from the embattled fund this quarter. SAC Capital and its founder Steve Cohen are believed to be under investigation for insider trading, although neither have been accused of wrongdoing. From Strasburg: If the estimates hold, the outflows would represent more than half of the firm's remaining outside capital and would bring the total amount SAC investors have sought back this year to more than $5 billion. As of mid-May, the firm managed about $5.6 billion in outside money, out of a total of $14 billion in assets, according to details of its operations as described by SAC representatives to clients and others outside the firm.&lt; SAC clients pulled $1.7 billion last quarter.

Emerging markets (EM) have come up against two earth-shaking developments in 2013: (1) slowing growth in China, coupled with the apparent end of the commodity supercycle; and (2) the rise of the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields, which have been especially spurred along in the past month by fears that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering back monetary stimulus sooner than expected. The prospect of Fed tapering sparked a sizable rally in the dollar and a sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market over the course of May, sending bond yields to their highest levels in over a year. The chart below shows a cross-section of some of the worst performers against the U.S. dollar in EM (plus Australia) since May 2, which is when the Treasury sell-off really got started. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergSince then, the South African rand has depreciated 12.8% against the U.S. dollar, while the Australian dollar has fallen 7.1%, the Brazilian real is down 6.6%, the Mexican peso has retreated 5.2%, the Turkish lira is 4.6% lower, and the Polish zloty has lost 3.9%. However, it's not just EM currencies â€” which fell 2.0% against the dollar in May â€” that had a bad month. EM sovereign debt priced in local currencies declined 3.0%, EM debt priced in foreign currencies fell 2.3%, and EM equities retreated 0.8%, even as equity markets across the developed world continued grinding higher. These moves have triggered a sharp wave of pessimism toward EM across Wall Street. In its latest report, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's EM strategy team, led byÂ BenoiÌ‚t Anne,Â declares "the end of the bull market" in the emerging world, writing, "We no longer believe there is upside in emerging markets this year." In a similar fashion, the latest report from BofA Merrill Lynch strategists features downgrades ofÂ 2013 and 2014 real GDP growth forecasts across global EM to 4.9% (from 5.2%) and 5.5% (from 5.6%), respectively. Deutsche Bank strategistsÂ Mallika Sachdeva,Â Sameer Goel, andÂ Arjun Shetty assert in their latest client note thatÂ "EM [currencies are] waking up to the threat of a more vicious channel of adjustment, via an unwind of the golden period for EM debt flows." "To be sure, we may well pause here if equity markets put the brakes on the global rates sell-off," write Sachdeva, Goel, and Shetty, "but the curtain on EM debt vulnerability has been raised." Why is this happening now? The first trigger for the sell-off across asset classes in EM comes as participants observe a slowdown in economic growth in China â€” the world's biggest commodity consumer â€” unfolding in 2013. "China has reached a new phase, less focused on infrastructureÂ and urbanization, both of which are highly commodity intensive," wrote economist Ed Morse, Citi's Global Head of Commodities Research, in a recent note to clients declaring the end of the commodity supercycle.Â "Lower single-digit economic growth shifting to a greater emphasis on consumption rather than investment hits industrial metals, bulk commodities and to a lesser degree energy demand." That's why the Aussie dollar, the strength of which is largely dependent on commodity exports to China â€“ is now facing such sharp declines. And because the Australian economy relies on these exports to China to fuel domestic growth, when China slows, Australia slows as well â€” just like other economies also dependent on exports to China. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index hit its highest levels in over a year at the end of May as investors sold Treasuries and bond yields raced upward, naturally sending the value of most other currencies downward against the dollar. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergHowever, there's another big reason EM is taking a hit all of the sudden, now that the Fed's quantitative easing policies appear set to reverse sooner rather than later: rising Treasury yields could be signaling the end of the great "reach for yield" trade that has completely seized global financial markets over the past several years. As stimulative monetary policy in the developed world, led by the Fed in the United States, has depressed bond yields in traditional "safe haven" markets like that for U.S. Treasuries, investors have poured funds into riskier debt markets â€” like those across the emerging world â€” in search of higher coupon payments. In October, we highlighted how this global reach for yield was causing investors to pile hundreds of billions of dollars into EM debt â€” even in places as far flung as Ukraine, Bosnia, and Seychelles â€” as the global bond bubble really began to bewilder and amaze observers. Reflecting on the insanely low bond yields in some of these places at the time as a result of the big influx of cash, UBS interest rate strategists lamented, "We can honestly say that we would not have predicted 5Â years back that this day would come." In the past month â€” the past week, even â€” the story is starting to sound a little different. "Despite the fundamentally favourable environment for EM [debt] exposure, we are now turning to a bearish view," writes the SocGen team, "as EM local markets are now primarily driven by the top-down theme of global liquidity retrenchmentâ€”or expectations thereof." The SocGen call comes at the end of a week in which EM debt funds â€” a favorite hiding place for bond investors reaching for yield â€” recorded their first weekly outflow in a yearÂ (totaling $0.2 billion, or 0.1% of assets under management). "Generally speaking, what we are observing here may be a fundamental shift in the strategic theme," says the SocGen team. "We initially thought that this theme shift would be operating much later in the year, but as often [is] the case in markets, there has been some front-running of the market moves relative to the actual policy signals or the hard data." In other words, the first outflows from EM debt in over a year this week likely indicate that the "fast money" is circling. "As much as [these flows into EM debt tend] to be sticky â€“ because these are indexed, long-term, kind of real money investors â€“ when things turn in terms of flows, that will be very risky," said BNP Paribas Head of CEEMEA Strategy Bartosz Pawlowski in an interview, referring to the South African bond market. "I think what is going on at the moment is that some of the â€“ let's say, 'fast money' â€“ coming into it is kind of trying to anticipate that, or pre-position for this." And given the devaluation underway across emerging market currencies, the Deutsche Bank strategists â€” like many of their peers â€” argue that this is likely just the beginning of the unwind of the big EM debt trade of the post-global financial crisis era: EM local currency bond funds have received heady inflows this year, in excess of those preceding the 2011 sell-off. These flows are vulnerable not only to a sharper US yield backup, but also to local FX weakness which could compel the unwind of unhedged holdings. Indeed, flows capitulated back in 2011 after a sharp sell-off in FX. The drawdown in our Asian FX index in May is currently running at about half the losses which preceded the outflow shift in 2011. And debt flows are turning lower from their peak already. Irrespective of whether this week was merely a sneak preview, or indeed the first act of the EM debt unwind story; it compels an analysis of where the vulnerabilities lie. The SocGen team makes a similar argument. "So far, we have seen little evidence of real-money outflows, but this is precisely a major risk going forward," they write. "Massive exits could indeed mean an escalation of stress in the local markets, with negative repercussions on currencies." Finally, they warn: "All high-yielding local bond markets are exposed at this point, including Turkey, Russia, Mexico or South Africa, Hungary among the most obvious ones." The big story may be in EM currency and debt markets, but EM stocks have fallen prey to the sell-off as well. Emerging market equity funds saw their biggest outflow last week ($2.9 billion, or 0.3% of assets under management)Â in 18 months. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR Global However, as is evident from the chart above, EM equities have already been falling out of favor for a few months now. BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey"A fading China growth outlook (our 2013 GDP growth forecast was recently cut to 7.6%), poor market returns, and a weak commodity price backdrop (our Brent crude oil and gold price forecasts were just revised lower), have unsurprisingly caused EM equities to be one of the most unloved areas of the global market," write BofA strategists Swathi Putcha, Michael Hartnett, and Brian Leung. To wit: "Our May Fund Manager Survey revealed that just a net 3% of investors reported an OW to EM equities, down from 43% OW in February." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, DataStreamTo really drive home how unloved EM equities have become this year, the BofA strategists point out that valuation of EM stocks relative to those in developed markets has similarly plunged to extreme lows. Thus, from a relative value perspective, EM stocks have become significantly more attractive in recent months, especially vis-a-vis their counterparts in currency and debt markets. Despite having already fallen out of favor somewhat, EM stocks are still likely to suffer if the EM debt unwind is, in fact, on. "If concerns over the Fedâ€™s QE exit strategy were to have a meaningfully negative impact on EM debt, consumer stocks in the region would also likely suffer," writes the BofA team. "A better entry point into EM assets may be after we see a correction in EM debt." Much of the analysis being put forth on the topic presumes that we are seeing the end of the bull market in EM, as SocGen suggests. This, in turn, is driven by the views highlighted above: that rising U.S. Treasury yields are about to put an end to the global "reach for yield" of the past few years. However, some argue that just because the prospect of tighter monetary policy from the Fed has become more likely, it doesn't necessarily spell the end for the dizzying flows into EM debt markets from global investors in recent years. "Investments were driven not entirely by a search for yield, but by a structural reallocation of global diversified portfolios (pension, insurance and SWFs) towards EM fixed income that will likely continue over the long term," write Morgan Stanley currency strategists Ian Stannard and Meena Bassily. "We argue these are sticky flows, and will be slow to reverse (if at all)." In other words, Stannard and Bassily think the type of "real money" investors that have entered into EM debt aren't planning on abandoning ship any time soon. "True, allocations to EM fixed income may slow as yields rise elsewhere, which in itself could cause some market disruption," say the Morgan Stanley strategists. "But risks of anÂ immediate-term liquidation or a rush for the exits are low, in our view."
Wikimedia CommonsSouth Korean WonSouth Korean exports unexpectedly jumped by 3.2% year-over-year in May, accelerating from a 0.4% growth rate in April. This was much stronger than the 0.9% decline expected by economists. This confirms the unexpected strength in Friday's strong China PMI report. This number is particularly impressive considering Japan's efforts to devalue its currency. Many saw South Korea as the biggest loser in this since it exports many of the same goods as Japan. According to Bloomberg, the South Korean won has fallen 18% against the Japanese yen. Economists across Wall Street dub South Korean exports as the global economic canary in the coal mine. Korean trade data usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. Since the yen-devaluing era of Abenomics began, Korean exports have been more volatile due to currency swings. But that's not to say that the report doesn't offer a great preview for the rest of the month's economic reports.
REUTERS/Adeel HalimIndia's GDP climbed 4.8% year-over-year in the January-March quarter. This was the slowest pace of growth in a decade.  For the fiscal year ending March 31, growth was 5%, down from 6.2% the previous year. Economic growth has been slowing for nearly three years. India has massive potential, and in the early part of the century was identified by Goldman's Jim O'Neil as one of the BRICs. So what explains the persistently mediocre performance? At the moment there are certain cyclical issues, but big picture, the country suffers from corruption, horrible infrastructure, and protectionism. On the cyclical front we have problems like declining consumer confidence, declining industrial output, poor monsoons, and weakness in the rupee. "Supply and policy obstacles have seen growth decelerate and investment and industrial output slump, with the stasis compounded by weak global demand," said ADB Chief Economist Changyong Rhee in an April report. "Policymakers need to remove structural hurdles to faster growth, and while there have been some encouraging recent reforms, more is needed." Let's look at some of the deeper rooted issues like the nation's current account deficit woes, slow pace of economic reforms, and decline in investment because of corruption. The Current Account Deficit Problem Current account deficit (when the value of imports exceeds that of exports) fears have been central to India's economic slump. The current account deficit reached a record high of 6.7% of GDP in the last quarter and has been blamed for weakening the Indian rupee. Remember, India isn't a heavily export dependent nation — exports account for about 25% of GDP in India, compared with about 31% in China. Gold and oil imports have been blamed for rise in current account deficit. And after raising import duties on gold twice in 2012, India is again mulling curbs on gold imports. Moody's analyst Atsi Sheth has previously said "policies that trigger private investment and curb inflationary pressures in the near-term are more likely to help narrow the account deficit." Morgan Stanley India's central bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao has said that inflation and the current account deficit have limited the monetary policy tools available to the central bank. But cooling inflation has eased some pressure. And India is also struggling to curb its fiscal deficit. "While there was justification for running a high fiscal deficit for a short period of a year or so after the credit crisis to support confidence in growth, continuing with it for four consecutive years has hurt the economy," write Morgan Stanley analysts Chetan Ahya and Upasana Chacra. Slow pace of economic reforms weighing on growth The slump in investment in the past few years has highlighted the need for economic reform aimed at drawing in foreign investment. The measures rolled out in the FY13-14 budget disappointed markets on this front. One of the biggest disappointments at the time was the failure to deliver on bigger issues like a cut on withholding taxes on debt investments.  In May, the government finally gave markets what they wanted. It announced that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and qualified foreign investors (QFIs) would be subject to a withholding rate of 5%, down from 20% on income from government and corporate bonds, from June 1 to May 31, 2015. But India is still considered very protectionist. The back-and-forth on allowing 51% foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail that impacts retailers like Walmart is probably the most well known. That had an unhappy resolution with the central government approving the measure but putting the onus on state governments by allowing them to decide whether they would let foreign retailers set up shop. More recently, pharma giant Pfizer criticized India for its "protectionist intellectual property regime" to the U.S. House Committee, according to the Financial Times. At the same hearing, a lobby of U.S. tech companies criticized India for its “preferential market access policy. There are also calls for reform around other bills like the Direct Taxes Code (DTC), the Land Acquisition Bill, and the Mines and Minerals Bill. The DTC Bill would replace the existing income tax act to include many  companies and individuals that slipped through the tax net before. The Land Acquisition Bill, one of the more controversial ones, aims to classify the manner in which the government can obtain land from farmers for infrastructure projects. CitiProtests over seized land have caused many projects to be stalled. And analysts say that getting these projects back on track, and getting new projects in the pipeline, are key to driving growth. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill is another important economic reform. The most controversial clause in the bill requires miners to share their profits with the community that is affected by their work, according to the The Statesman. Coal miners would be required to share 26% of their profits. Major corruption and poor infrastructure  India's mining sector is the perfect example of the kind of corruption that India has to crackdown on if it hopes to draw investment, increase supply, and drive growth.  The Coalgate Scandal as it is popularly known emerged from a report by India's Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that accused the ruling UPA government of selling coal fields to top industrialists without using competitive bidding practices, and giving them "undue benefits." The CAG claimed this cost the government billions of dollars in revenue. But this isn't the only corruption scandal that has delivered a blow to India's economy. In recent years we saw corruption around the Commonwealth Games, the telecom scam, and most recently in cricket, with the Indian Premier League. India ranked 94 on Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. This was below three of its BRICs counterparts, Brazil, China, and South Africa. Only Russia ranked lower at 133. Rampant corruption has been a major deterrent to foreign companies looking to invest in India.  World Economic ForumThe nation's infrastructure problems act as another huge deterrent. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2012-2013 ranked India 70 out 144 for infrastructure. "Inadequate supply of infrastructure," "corruption," and "inefficient government bureaucracy," were cited as the top three most problematic factors for doing business. Some 600 million people were left without power last year. And corruption has largely contributed to the power shortages. A report from the Herald Net at the time pointed out that "transmission and distribution losses in some states are as much as 50 percent because of theft and corruption by employees in the power industry." Besides the Coalgate scandal, India's coal mafia have also been blamed for its power outages, since lack of coal has kept many power stations idle. In fact, India has missed every annual target to increase electricity production capacity since 1951, according to a Bloomberg report. The country has seen the gap between demand and supply of power jump to 10.2 percent in March this year, from 7.7 percent in March 2011, according to The New York Times.  The economy is bottoming out but elections still stand in the way The one silver lining is that experts think the economy is bottoming out. Morgan Stanley analysts Chetan Ahya and Upasana Chacra argue that the decline post the financial crisis that was due to a "bad growth mix," of high fiscal deficit, strong growth in rural wages, and low investment, and that this is starting to reverse. BAMLWhat's more? Investor sentiment on India has picked up. Bank of America's latest fund manager survey showed that investors were net 38% overweight in May, compared with 27% underweight in April. While the government has been trying to push through reforms and review growth ahead of the 2014 general elections, some argue that the elections will be an obstacle to reviving economic growth.  "However, and despite some recent legislative successes (eg, raising administered fuel prices and easing restrictions on foreign investment in some sectors), we expect his efforts to be increasingly hindered by electoral considerations from here on," says Nomura's Alastair Newton. With India set to account for one fifth of the world's working age population, the country's burgeoning youth can only hope that its leaders get serious about reviving and reforming the economy.
SocGen is fully on board the twin notions of economic recovery and a rising interest rate environment in the U.S. From Michala Marcusen on the top topics from the week ahead: MORE CONFIDENCE AND MORE JOBS IN THE US The May employment report takes centre stage this week and our US data expert Brian Jones is calling for a 210K increase on non-fall payrolls, well above consensus of 165K. Combined with our call for 52 on the June manufacturing ISM, this will keep the QE exit debate very much alive and support our call that asset purchases will be tapered in the autumn. MARKET ISSUES: Our call for the 10-year US Treasury yield to head to 2.75% by yearend no longer seems extreme as discussed in detail in the US Focus this week. Moreover, medium-term we continue to see the 10-year back at 5% by 2017. A FAQ in this context is just how high yields can go before endangering the recovery. Of course, the path matters and disorderly market movements would have negative feed-loops to the real economy. Assuming the path is relatively smooth, however, we see no major issue with the 10-year normalising back to 5% by 2017 as highlighted in The end of household deleveraging.  A 2.75% yield on the 10-year isn't really so high, but it does get us back to where things were in early 2011.

Flickr / zcopleyIt's been a wild couple months for digital currencies. This past week saw the bust of Liberty Reserve for its alleged role in billions of dollars of illicit transactions, and two days later the largest bitcoin exchange said it would now require all accounts to be verified. For the digital currency to survive, must it sacrifice its soul? Can it thrive if it does? To be sure, there are important differences between bitcoin and Liberty Reserve. Where Liberty was effectively a black box for transactions, controlled by a single entity, bitcoins are traded on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority. (Bitcoin did have its own law-enforcement episode on May 17, when the Department of Homeland Security froze the accounts of two U.S.-based bitcoin processors. The alleged misdeed: failing to properly register.) In the Liberty Reserve case, the illegalities were brash, according to U.S. officials. One million users across the worldâ€”one-fifth of them Americansâ€”made 55 million transactions over seven years to the tune of $6 billion, with few questions asked while Costa Rica-based Liberty collected 1 percent, investigators said. The network is thought to have been employed in the $45 million ATM heist for which eight people were arrested in May. (Read More: US Charges Eight in $45 Million Cybercrime Scheme) Chicago-based investment fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann said bitcoin holders should be spooked, because the digital exchanges have been used by criminals for money laundering as well. But Peter Vessenes, chairman and executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, was unfazed by the Liberty Reserve crackdown. "The U.S. put out guidance recently through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and we've been following up on that guidance and crushing bad actors," he said in an interview with CNBC Asia. "We're seeing a bit of a sweep right now," he said. "There's nothing to indicate that good players who are working hard to stay regulated have anything to worry about." And there's the rub: The techno-libertarian fantasy of an unfettered digital currency is losing its veil of anonymity and is dependent upon ensuring the appeasement of government regulators. It's enough to make a cryptotarian anarchist blanch. (Read More: Feds in NY: Costa Rica Money Biz a Hub for Crooks) However, bitcoin holders also seem to have taken the Liberty Reserve bust mostly in stride; trading volume surged significantly on the news, but nowhere near the mid-April levels when bitcoin exchange rates swung by hundreds of dollars in a few hours, after the Cyprus financial crisis shook faith in banking institutions and made bitcoin an overnight sensation. The exchange rate, while volatile by currency standards, has steadied between $100 and $140 for most of the time since that dust settled, and was around $128 Friday, just 6 percent off May highs, according to data on bitcoincharts.com. "The $64 billion question is: Are these new safeguards window dressing, or will they effectively handle the problems?" asked Stoltmann. "It's such a new phenomenon, we just don't know." A truly transparent bitcoin market, with a spotlight on the identity of all transactors, would seemingly be of little interest to criminals. But then, who does want that? At a time when people are increasingly wary of stores and websites collecting their personal information, Vessenes says it's on the consumer to scrutinize the party on the other end of a transaction, and to be suspicious if they don't want to pry. "As a consumer, I stay away from companies that have questionable know-your-customer policies," he said. "They're suspiciously light on how much information they want about you." (Read More: BitCoin Is Gold 2.0: Venture Capitalist) So if anonymity is gone and a hypervigilance about identity sharing is required or advisable, what is bitcoin's remaining appeal? For one, as a currency of limited quantityâ€”about half of the 22 million bitcoins that can ultimately be "mined" through complicated computer data crunching are currently on the marketâ€”it is appealing as a hedge against inflation, said Tyler Moore, a Southern Methodist University computer science professor who has studied bitcoin exchanges. On the other hand, when holders become convinced that value is bound to rise, they tend to hoard their treasure. Moore, who has studied hacker breaches of bitcoin accounts, notes that a downside of the digital currency is that having no central governing authority for a currency means having no recourse when one's account is raided. He sees a regulated bitcoin as a feasible, if ironic, solution to keeping the currency viable, given the exchanges cooperate. And then, he says, "criminals will shift to a currency the authorities aren't keeping a close eye on."
This is a chart we fully expect to see a lot of in the coming weeks. It's a chart of the average rate on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, and although the actual rate is incredibly low by historical standards, there's been a notable spike up in the last month. With the housing market recovering, and increasing chatter about the Fed ending extraordinary measures to ease policy, it's only a matter of time before rising mortgage rates becomes a mainstream story. And that story will be all about: Is the great once-in-a-lifetime chance to buy a house going away? FRED
REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiFed Chair Ben Bernanke has given his 2nd commencement speech of the season. The first was to the graduates of Simon's Rock, an offbeat school in Western Mass. Today he delivered a speech to graduates of Princeton, where of course he was an econ professor before becoming Fed chair. His speech is short and simple, offering 10 pieces of advice and wisdom to the graduates. The whole thing is posted below the dotted line below, but if you don't want to read the whole thing, here's a summary of the 10 pieces of wisdom from Bernanke in bullet form. And here's the whole speech: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It's nice to be back at Princeton. I find it difficult to believe that it's been almost 11 years since I departed these halls for Washington. I wrote recently to inquire about the status of my leave from the university, and the letter I got back began, "Regrettably, Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can accommodate."1  I'll extend my best wishes to the seniors later, but first I want to congratulate the parents and families here. As a parent myself, I know that putting your kid through college these days is no walk in the park. Some years ago I had a colleague who sent three kids through Princeton even though neither he nor his wife attended this university. He and his spouse were very proud of that accomplishment, as they should have been. But my colleague also used to say that, from a financial perspective, the experience was like buying a new Cadillac every year and then driving it off a cliff. I should say that he always added that he would do it all over again in a minute. So, well done, moms, dads, and families. This is indeed an impressive and appropriate setting for a commencement. I am sure that, from this lectern, any number of distinguished spiritual leaders have ruminated on the lessons of the Ten Commandments. I don't have that kind of confidence, and, anyway, coveting your neighbor's ox or donkey is not the problem it used to be, so I thought I would use my few minutes today to make Ten Suggestions, or maybe just Ten Observations, about the world and your lives after Princeton. Please note, these points have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates. My qualification for making such suggestions, or observations, besides having kindly been invited to speak today by President Tilghman, is the same as the reason that your obnoxious brother or sister got to go to bed later--I am older than you. All of what follows has been road-tested in real-life situations, but past performance is no guarantee of future results. 1. The poet Robert Burns once said something about the best-laid plans of mice and men ganging aft agley, whatever "agley" means. A more contemporary philosopher, Forrest Gump, said something similar about life and boxes of chocolates and not knowing what you are going to get. They were both right. Life is amazingly unpredictable; any 22-year-old who thinks he or she knows where they will be in 10 years, much less in 30, is simply lacking imagination. Look what happened to me: A dozen years ago I was minding my own business teaching Economics 101 in Alexander Hall and trying to think of good excuses for avoiding faculty meetings. Then I got a phone call . . . In case you are skeptical of Forrest Gump's insight, here's a concrete suggestion for each of the graduating seniors. Take a few minutes the first chance you get and talk to an alum participating in his or her 25th, or 30th, or 40th reunion--you know, somebody who was near the front of the P-rade. Ask them, back when they were graduating 25, 30, or 40 years ago, where they expected to be today. If you can get them to open up, they will tell you that today they are happy and satisfied in various measures, or not, and their personal stories will be filled with highs and lows and in-betweens. But, I am willing to bet, those life stories will in almost all cases be quite different, in large and small ways, from what they expected when they started out. This is a good thing, not a bad thing; who wants to know the end of a story that's only in its early chapters? Don't be afraid to let the drama play out. 2. Does the fact that our lives are so influenced by chance and seemingly small decisions and actions mean that there is no point to planning, to striving? Not at all. Whatever life may have in store for you, each of you has a grand, lifelong project, and that is the development of yourself as a human being. Your family and friends and your time at Princeton have given you a good start. What will you do with it? Will you keep learning and thinking hard and critically about the most important questions? Will you become an emotionally stronger person, more generous, more loving, more ethical? Will you involve yourself actively and constructively in the world? Many things will happen in your lives, pleasant and not so pleasant, but, paraphrasing a Woodrow Wilson School adage from the time I was here, "Wherever you go, there you are." If you are not happy with yourself, even the loftiest achievements won't bring you much satisfaction. 3. The concept of success leads me to consider so-called meritocracies and their implications. We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies are fair. Putting aside the reality that no system, including our own, is really entirely meritocratic, meritocracies may be fairer and more efficient than some alternatives. But fair in an absolute sense? Think about it. A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate--these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others. As the Gospel of Luke says (and I am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in a good cause): "From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded" (Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible). Kind of grading on the curve, you might say. 4. Who is worthy of admiration? The admonition from Luke--which is shared by most ethical and philosophical traditions, by the way--helps with this question as well. Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their adversities. I think most of us would agree that people who have, say, little formal schooling but labor honestly and diligently to help feed, clothe, and educate their families are deserving of greater respect--and help, if necessary--than many people who are superficially more successful. They're more fun to have a beer with, too. That's all that I know about sociology. 5. Since I have covered what I know about sociology, I might as well say something about political science as well. In regard to politics, I have always liked Lily Tomlin's line, in paraphrase: "I try to be cynical, but I just can't keep up." We all feel that way sometime. Actually, having been in Washington now for almost 11 years, as I mentioned, I feel that way quite a bit. Ultimately, though, cynicism is a poor substitute for critical thought and constructive action. Sure, interests and money and ideology all matter, as you learned in political science. But my experience is that most of our politicians and policymakers are trying to do the right thing, according to their own views and consciences, most of the time. If you think that the bad or indifferent results that too often come out of Washington are due to base motives and bad intentions, you are giving politicians and policymakers way too much credit for being effective. Honest error in the face of complex and possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad results than are bad motives. For these reasons, the greatest forces in Washington are ideas, and people prepared to act on those ideas. Public service isn't easy. But, in the end, if you are inclined in that direction, it is a worthy and challenging pursuit. 6. Having taken a stab at sociology and political science, let me wrap up economics while I'm at it. Economics is a highly sophisticated field of thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices they made in the past were wrong. About the future, not so much. However, careful economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it can help kill ideas that are completely logically inconsistent or wildly at variance with the data. This insight covers at least 90 percent of proposed economic policies. 7. I'm not going to tell you that money doesn't matter, because you wouldn't believe me anyway. In fact, for too many people around the world, money is literally a life-or-death proposition. But if you are part of the lucky minority with the ability to choose, remember that money is a means, not an end. A career decision based only on money and not on love of the work or a desire to make a difference is a recipe for unhappiness. 8. Nobody likes to fail but failure is an essential part of life and of learning. If your uniform isn't dirty, you haven't been in the game. 9. I spoke earlier about definitions of personal success in an unpredictable world. I hope that as you develop your own definition of success, you will be able to do so, if you wish, with a close companion on your journey. In making that choice, remember that physical beauty is evolution's way of assuring us that the other person doesn't have too many intestinal parasites. Don't get me wrong, I am all for beauty, romance, and sexual attraction--where would Hollywood and Madison Avenue be without them? But while important, those are not the only things to look for in a partner. The two of you will have a long trip together, I hope, and you will need each other's support and sympathy more times than you can count. Speaking as somebody who has been happily married for 35 years, I can't imagine any choice more consequential for a lifelong journey than the choice of a traveling companion. 10. Call your mom and dad once in a while. A time will come when you will want your own grown-up, busy, hyper-successful children to call you. Also, remember who paid your tuition to Princeton. Those are my suggestions. They're probably worth exactly what you paid for them. But they come from someone who shares your affection for this great institution and who wishes you the best for the future. Congratulations, graduates. Give 'em hell.
Marc Faber, author of the "Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report," is as bearish as ever. "People with assets are all doomed, because prices are grossly inflated globally for stocks, bonds, and collectibles," says the investment advisor in a new interview published in this week's Barron's. But Faber is the first to admit that at least the timing of some of his calls has been wrong. From Barron's: I thought the U.S. market would have a 20% correction last fall, but it didn't happen. I also said the market might explode to the upside before the correction occurred. We might be in the final acceleration phase now. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is at 1650. It could rally to 1750 or even 2000 in the next month or two before collapsing. Fortunately for Faber, he's actually been exposed to stocks, which might surprise some people who have been listening to his message of doom.Â  From Barron's: I own equities, and I should thank Mr. Bernanke. The Fed has been flooding the system with money....I don't know how the world will look in five years, so I have heeded Ray Dalio's advice to diversify. [Dalio heads the investment firm Bridgewater Associates.] I keep 25% of my assets in equities. I haven't shorted anything yet, although I am tempted to short the S&amp;P or the Russell 2000. I don't own U.S. stocks, but I hold some Asian shares, including Singapore real-estate investment trusts, which I will discuss momentarily. Even the most aggressive bears understand that it is prudent to be broadly diversified, which sometimes means having an underweight exposure to the asset they deem so risky. Unfortunately, the intensity of the bearish growl often scares investors away from the asset class altogether.
APIf things had gone differently last November when President Obama soundly secured a second term over Republican nominee Mitt Romney, had Romney come away the victor, the White House would have received a massive Bain-ification day 1 makeover. Time's Zeke Miller reports the Republican commissioned the Romney Readiness Project, a 138-page report preparing the specific changes Romney would have exacted when he took over office from Obama on Inauguration Day had he succeeded. A team of around 500 worked for R2P, Inc., the official company name for his transition team. Romney didn't put any slouches at the head of this organization, either. Former Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt was chair and former General Motors chief financial officer Christopher Liddell ran operations.  In a morning-after-election-day briefing prepared for a victorious Romney, the group was going to recommend dividing the White House into three teams: "'Care &amp; Feeding Offices,' like speechwriting, 'Policy Offices,' like the National Security Council, and 'Packaging &amp; Selling Offices,' like the office of the press secretary," Miller explains. The slide show breaking down the White House in business terms Romney, the former financial executive, could understand gets even more hilarious: "The White House is a lot like a holding firm," one slide says. Three times. They also planned to turn the White House into a corporate-structured monolith instead of the muddled bureaucracy Washington is known for. Per Miller:  Among the recommendations for the Romney administration: And after lunch, there would have been trust falls. Some think this report is embarrassing, but we don't see why: Seriously, this is an embarrassment. It's like the Romney administration was going to be one big Learning Annex. swampland.time.com/2013/06/02/mit… Romney transition plan or undergrad entrepreneurs club? You decide. My god.swampland.time.com/2013/06/02/mit… Read Miller's entire report, that has the entire presentation -- flow charts and all! -- as prepared for Romney, because it really is a marvellous thing to behold.  Click here to follow The Atlantic Wire.

REUTERS/John GressWorkers dye the Chicago River green as part of the city's annual St. Patrick's day celebrations in Chicago.Author Rachel Shteir recently caused an uproar in Chicago after ripping into her adopted city. Writing in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, Shteir accused Chicago of being stiflingly conformist, regularly electing crooks and idiots and generally clinging to outmoded cliches about itself.Â  "[T]he city is trapped by its location, its past, and what philosophers would have called its facticity â€” its limitations, given the circumstances," she wrote. "Boosterism has been perfected here because the reality is too painful to look at. Poor Chicago, indeed." Indeed, Chicago has to confront some harsh truths. It is not the place it once was, even a decade ago, let alone a century. Yet, its heyday was recent enoughÂ that to sense its floundering stings all the more intensely.Â  We wanted to survey how bad it's gotten, and whether there's any hope for the city that PBS bittersweetly still refers to as "The City Of The Century."
Reuters/Andrew KellyNo matter how many times embarrassing Wall Street emails, conversations, or tirades get made public, it never seems to stop.Â  Even the most respected Wall Streeters can put their foot in their mouths from time to time at events such as investor days or panels at colleges and universities. Â  Â  So we've decided to compile a rundown of Wall Street's most embarrassing words they probably wish were never made public.
LinkedInA secret affair with the potential to rock the Government was revealed last night, leaving David Cameron "stunned". The identities of those involved cannot be revealed for legal reasons, but is said that the relationship was between two middle-aged figures and has now come to an end. The revelation could have political implications for David Cameron, who has been hit by a number of scandals recently. He was said to be “stunned” by the news, the importance of which he realised "immediately". In meetings the Prime Minister and his aides discussed the potential implications of the affair becoming public, and the damage it could do to major political plans, the Mail on Sunday reported. “This revelation is dynamite. None of us could believe it when we first heard it. Then we just thought, “What a complete mess”,” a source told the newspaper. However, a Downing Street spokesman said today: "There have been no crisis talks or meetings." It is believed that David Cameron has been told about the affair – which has also caused those involved personal distress – in recent weeks. No current cabinet member is believed to be involved, but it is said that the affair could be as publicly shocking as that between John Major and Edwina Currie which was kept secret for almost two decades. The news comes as David Cameron faces Tory back-bench revolts over the European referendum and gay marriage and rumours of a leadership challenge. It also emerged days after Conservative MP Patrick Mercer resigned following a joint cash-for-questions investigation by The Telegraph and the BBC's Panorama Since then a number of senior politician have become embroiled in the growing Parliamentary lobbying scandal. The party has also been rocked by allegations of sexual assault against Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, whose office in the House of Commons was raided last month after a third man came forward and made allegations against the Conservative MP. 
Flickr/Ian SaneJust a quick reminder: This is going to be a huge week for the economy, everyone will be watching, and the festivities start later tonight. So enjoy your Sunday, and then get back to your computer to watch it all. We did a whole preview of this Saturday, but the gist is that Sunday night is the beginning of Global PMI Day, which is when each country reports manufacturing data. Then the rest of the week there's lots of data from the U.S. And because everyone is so focused on whether the Fed is going to tighten policy soon, the data takes on added importance. So come back Sunday evening, and follow Sam Ro covering the Asian data, and then in the early morning Monday for European coverage, followed by U.S. data tomorrow.
CNNHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) slammed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Sunday, painting him as a "paid liar" who is not telling the whole story about the scandal at the Internal Revenue Service.  "The administration is still — their paid liar, their spokesperson, he’s still making up things about what happens and calling this a local rogue," Issa said on CNN's "State of the Union" with Candy Crowley. On CNN, Issa read from transcripts of interviews with workers in the IRS' Cincinnati office, from which the IRS has said the agency's inappropriate targeting of conservative groups started. Issa said that the interviews with the Cincinnati workers show that the problem "was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters" — something that Crowley pushed back as "totally not definitive." "We're getting to proving it," Issa said.  "The president's spokesman – spokesperson – is saying whatever is convenient at the time. The story changes." Crowley read part of one transcript on the show, in which an agent said he "believes" directions for extra Tea Party scrutiny originated in Washington.
Gold has been one of the worst performing asset classes in the global financial markets this year, strengthening the bears' case that the yellow metal has no intrinsic value. With gold prices trending lower and the dollar moving higher, the short-sellers have been piling on. But while the investment class is largely staying away from the yellow metal, the Chinese consumer is only rushing in. Below is a chart from Morgan Stanley's China Pulse report.Â  It shows sales growth for various goods in March and April. As you can see, the Chinese people rushed in like crazy to take advantage of the lower price. While the value of gold continues to be up for debate, anyone consider shorting gold should consider the price floor put in by what Frank Holmes has dubbed the gold "love trade." Morgan Stanley
Tim SamarasStorm chaser Tim Samaras, Samaras's son Paul Samaras, and Samaras's chase partner Carl Young were killed in the Oklahoma tornado on Friday, a Denver ABC affiliate reports. Samaras has been chasing storms for 30 years. He has worked with the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, and Boeing. Tim SamarasTim SamarasAccording to the Denver Channel, Samaras's brother Jim posted the following statement on Samaras's Facebook page this morning (the page is "currently unavailable"): I'm Jim Samaras - Tim Samaras's brother. Thank you to everyone for the condolences. It truly is sad that we lost my great brother Tim and his great son, Paul. Our hearts also go out to the Carl Young family as well as they are feeling the same feelings we are today. They all unfortunately passed away but doing what they LOVED. Chasing Tornado's. I look at it that he is in the 'big tornado in the sky...' We (the family) will keep folks aware of what the funeral estrangements are, but please in the meantime keep Tim and Paul in your thoughts and prayers. Samaras's last tweet came on Friday: "Storms now initiating south of Watonga along triple point. Dangerous day ahead for OK--stay weather savvy!" The tweet included this photo: Tim Samaras Here's a video on Tim Samaras's website describing his work:  
The recent sell-off in the Treasury market has economists and analysts on watch for the impact of higher interest rates. There are two ways to think about rising rates: 1) It'll cause borrowing costs to rise, which will hurt the economy and squeeze corporate profits. Or 2) It's a sign of a strengthening economy, which means inflation will pick up and investors will seek riskier assets than bonds. The analysts at Deutsche Bank subscribe to that latter view, and they believe rising rates are probably good news for stocks. "Since 2000, rising bond yields have mostly been associated with rising equity markets," writes Deustche Bank in the its Equity House View report. "Even sharp rises in bond yields have overwhelmingly coincided with positive equity returns (88% of instances)." Here's DB's chart showing the positive correlation between stocks and interest rates since 2000. Deutsche Bank In a May 7 note to clients, Deutsche Bank strategist Francesco Curto took a close look at what happened with stocks when interest rates surged in 1994. "The best term of reference for assessing what may happen to equities and bonds in the near future may be the 1994 dynamics in both equities and bonds, according to some observers," wrote Curto. "Strong economic growth, with little inflation, makes the 1994 comparison with the current situation relevant" More from Curto: ...In fact, after the autumn 1994 peak in bond yields we saw a significant rise in the level of the S&amp;P 500. We are also of the opinion, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored, that a rise in bond yields will not precipitate another equity market crash in the near future. It is a risk that no central bank or politician can take. We believe that central banks are more willing to accept moderate inflation than the risk of a new equity crash. Deutsche Bank Here's Curto with more detail: A three-stage analysis of the 1994 sell-off from an equity perspectiveThe equity market response to the 1994 bond sell-off is best analysed through a threestage model. Stage 1 (falling bond yield): June 1991 to Sept 1993. In this period, the S&amp;P 500 went up 24% (from 371 to 459) and 10-year bond yields went from 8.23% to 5.38%. Financials, Telecoms and Utilities were the best-performing sectors. Stage 2 (bond sell-off): Sept 1993 to Nov 1994. The S&amp;P 500 went from 459 to 454 and bond yields from 5.38% to 7.91%. The S&amp;P 500 lost 8.9% between 2nd February and 4th April before recovering. Utilities, Financials and Telecoms performed the worst; whilst IT, Healthcare and Staples did best. Stage 3 (falling bond yield): Nov 1994 to Jan 1996. The S&amp;P500 went from 454 to 636 and bond yields from 7.91% to 5.58%. Health Care, Financials, IT and Industrials were the best performing sectors. Telecoms and Utilities rallied, but not enough to offset their losses from Stage 2. Of all of the things that should have stock market investors worried, perhaps rising interest rates shouldn't be one of them.
“A Bug in Search of a Windshield” was the title of the chapter on Japan. This year, I wrote in my forecast issue that 2013 would be “The Year of the Windshield.”  For the last two weeks we have focused on the problems facing Japan, and such is the importance of Japan to the world economy that this week we will once again turn to the Land of the Rising Sun. I will try to summarize the situation facing the Japanese. This is critical to understand, because they are determined to share their problems with the world, and we will have no choice but to deal with them. Japan is going to affect your economy and your investments, no matter where you live; Japan is that important. In bullet-point fashion, let’s summarize the dilemma that faces Abe-san, Kuroda-san, and the other leaders of Japan.  Just for fun, here is a picture of Mr. Ponzi writing a check (courtesy of Geert Noels).     Problem #1: Your nation is aging, and internal consumer spending is not going to be a source of real growth. You have to talk like that can happen, but you know it is just not all that realistic. You have been trying for 20 years to get your country to spend, and people are just not up to it. What you really need is for your export base to get with the program and massively increase its sales to the rest of the world. In fact, that is your only real option. And one of the easiest ways to do that is to drive down the value of your currency, especially against the currencies of competitor nations. That boost in exports can help relieve your chronic excess productive capacity and maybe, possibly, hopefully, engender a labor shortage and drive up the cost of labor, which will help stimulate inflation. Problem #2: You are mired in deflation and have been for 20 years. Since there is no natural source of inflation in Japan – a nation of savers and an increasingly elderly population –you have to create inflation by increasing the prices of your imports. And the way to increase those prices is to drive down the value of your currency, especially against the dollar and the euro. Hmmm, we see a possible strategy emerging here.        Exporting Deflation This is a nightmare scenario for central bankers worldwide. If there is a mandate, a central theme in the Handbook for Central Bankers, it is that deflation must always and everywhere be fought tooth and nail. Deflation must be given no quarter. Who wants to become the next Japan? If deflation shows up on your watch, you have to fight it. And if your interest rates are already low, then the only tool you have in your deflation-fighting toolbox is quantitative easing. Let me be very clear. Japan is about to unleash the most significant currency war since the 1930s, when the world was still on the gold standard. The problem today is that politicians, labor unions, and businesses everywhere want to use exchange rates as the tool to manage their balance of trade, rather than focusing on improving their own competitiveness and manufacturing skills, not to mention controlling their own spending and fiscal budgets. The problem as they see it is the competition from abroad, which is always seen as doing something unfair. The pressure on central banks to respond to Japanese QE is going to be immense. As the yen has risen from 78 to around 100 today (against the dollar), central banks have so far said very little, since they realize that only a few years ago the yen was at 120 and falling. But we need to remember that the yen has been at 350 within the last 40 years. However, Japan is going to need to depreciate the yen by 15%-plus a year to get their 2% inflation, and within two years that means a yen at 130. And then 150 the next year, with 200 the extrapolated destination in five years. Can that happen in a vacuum? It is unrealistic to think it can. I think we may be entering a most dangerous period where politicians and central bankers feel the need to “do something,” and that something will include quantitative easing, exchange-rate actions, and protectionism. Think in terms of Central Bankers Gone Wild, armed with electronic printing presses and dreaming of new, ever more creative ways to stimulate the markets. Stay tuned. We will continue to focusing on these topics as the summer advances. In closing, a few notes on recent events that may not have come up on your Japan radar . Japan is discussing the need to impose rules on foreign exchange trading “to protect investors and limit speculation.” The nasty volatility that has developed is not the fault of their own policies, they say, but that of traders and hedge funds. Here is some discussion. And this note: Major Japanese banks plan to hike mortgage rates in June for the second consecutive month as long-term rates continue to creep up despite the Bank of Japan's efforts to guide them lower. This is just the beginning. Do not rule out exchange and capital controls when things get very wild in a few years. Those have been tried many times in many places. If I lived in Japan I might want to take a vacation in, say, Singapore, and maybe check out the new botanical gardens and casinos. And if perhaps I walked by a bank, I might drop in just to see how easy it is to open a bank account and transfer a little money. Just for some diversification, you understand. And perhaps I'd go ahead and move a few assets out of yen into a different currency. DC, NYC, France, Cyprus, and Vegas… I will be in Washington DC Monday evening meeting with the team at Mauldin Economics, shooting a few videos that we will soon post. One will be with Newt Gingrich, and we will be talking about the changing world from the positive perspective of accelerating progress in technology. That is so much more fun than talking about Japan. We are also going to be making some very exciting announcements about new projects and additions to the team in months to come. Then it's on to NYC for our Investing in the New Normal video webinar with Kyle Bass, Mohamed El-Erian, John Hussman, Barry Ritholtz and David Rosenberg. I have a lot of questions I want to ask these guys. You can join the fun (for free) by registering right here. After Father’s Day I am off to Monaco for a speech at the GAIM conference, and then I'll make my way to Cyprus to see for myself what the latest crisis aftermath looks like. Then on July 6 and 7 I'll be in Las Vegas. Reid Walker, friend and recovering hedge fund manager based here in Dallas, is organizing an event during the World Series of Poker on the theme of the intersection between investing and poker skills. This is just an entirely different world for me. I will not be entering the tournament –I know my limitations! But talking to some of the best players in the world and meeting Nate Silver and some of the other speakers will make for a fun weekend. The event is not cheap, but you can get a 10% discount by putting in the code "Mauldin10". Let me know if you're coming, and we'll get together for a meal. You can read more about the conference and register here. And here's an article in Hedge Fund Intelligence about Reid and the event. I know I mentioned Sagan’s famous riff "billions and billions" above. I also know he did not actually say it. The quote is actually from Johnny Carson, doing his impersonation of Carl Sagan. Eventually, Sagan did use "billions and billions" as the title of one of his last books. Just for the record – as some of you astute readers would have been quick to point out. We are down to the wire on closing on the apartments. Finally! Just a few documents to sign and then construction begins. I will move into a small place in the same building during the transition, which is optimistically scheduled to last three months but realistically could run a lot longer. But at least I will have access to my “stuff” and more than the one pair of shoes I trot the globe in now. I did not plan to be “homeless” and in a hotel this long. A positive aspect of it all is that I and my personal staff are becoming quite adept at being a virtual company. We have been progressing in that direction for years, but these last few months with no physical office have been the real test. Other than missing my multiple large screens, I am getting along quite well. Have a great week. I have friends waiting on me tonight and family to spend time with this weekend. And I'll hit the gym, catch up on a lot of reading, and enjoy a few episodes of the one TV show I watch, Game of Thrones. I look forward to relaxing and enjoying a long weekend.

During the Yankees - Red Sox game last night, FOX turned the camera on the man below, Bernando LaPallo, and asked viewers to guess how old he was. MLB.com screenshot Here's another screenshot of him. I guessed 78.Â What's your guess? MLB.com screenshot My guess, 78, was off by 33 years. Bernando LaPallo was born on August 17, 1901. He's 111 years old.*Â  LaPallo says he can get around fine and do everything he needs to do. He has a new book coming out on his 112th birthday: "Beyond 100 -- How to Live Well into Your Second Century." LaPallo credits his health to eating well, avoiding whiskey and wildness, and embracing moderation. According to Josh Vitale of MLB.com, he also rubs olive oil on his face and feet â€” the former to prevent wrinkles, and the latter to prevent calluses and corns. LaPallo says he had a stadium hot dog only once, when he ignored his father's warning that they would make him sick. It made him sick. He hasn't had one since. Here he is with Derek Jeter:  *UPDATE: Bernando LaPallo has no proof of his age. He was born in Brazil, and there are no one has found records there that can confirm his birthdate. U.S. public records have his birth year as 1910, which would make him 102. His grand-daughter says the 1910 is a misprint that was entered into Social Security computers in the 1930s.

Hands down, one of the most important tech projects Facebook has ever created is the Open Compute Project (OCP). Business Insider recently spoke with two of Facebook's OCP leaders to get the skinny on their latest, ambitious plan. To recap: OCP launched two years ago to create "open source" data center hardware. That means hardware vendors like HP, Dell and Cisco don't control the product designs. Instead, customers like Facebook and Goldman Sachs do. OCP's designs call for fewer materials and minimal cost, but require faster performance than what vendors typically offer. More importantly, OCP gives the designs away to everyone for free. Any enterprise can take them, modify them, and send them out to contract manufacturers, who are standing by to build them. The project has also grown far beyond Facebook, although Facebook VP of Supply Chain Operations Frank Frankovsky is still its leader. The OCP board also includes executives from Intel, Rackspace, Arista Networks, and Goldman Sachs. Earlier this month, OCP announced plans to push into the $23 billion Ethernet switch market, a project led by Facebook Director of Technical Operations Najam Ahmad.  Its goal is to create an "open source" network switch. A network switch connects the Ethernet cables within a building or across a campus. It also performs lots of other functions, from security to making the network run faster.  OCP's project could compete with switches from Cisco, HP and Dell. Alternatively, these vendors could join the group and participate. Dell and HP, for example, have been involved in the server project. Cisco, however, owns ~60% of the network switch market and it's unclear, so far, if Cisco will play nice or play dirty with OCP.  OCP is not the only group working on such things. A group called the Open Network Foundation (ONF) is creating standards, or blueprints, for software-defined networking gear. There's also another group called OpenDaylight, led by Cisco and IBM, working on open source SDN software. Here's what Ahmad and Frankovsky told us about OCP's plans in a lightly edited transcript: Business Insider: OCP has moved from servers to FacebookFacebook open source hardware guru Frank Frankovsky storage to motherboards and other hardware equipment. Why has it grown so much? Frank Frankovsky: Over the last two years we've seen a ton of progress made around the server hardware and the storage hardware and the data centers. People are making really cool and meaningful technology contributions with a lot of derivative work. Some of those are interesting things that no one at Facebook ever thought about. When you give one thing to the community, you tend to get 10 things back. And you just don't know what those 10 things are. BI: What's the goal for your network project and how is it different from what other groups are doing? Najam Ahmad: ONF actually reached out to OCP and asked us if we can tackle this. Today, if you wanted to buy a switch, it's a package that has hundreds of applications and features. OCP will create a [design for] a [switch] box that when it boots up, it looks for an operating system of your choice. We're trying to separate the hardware and the software and give you choices. BI: Wow, that's ambitious. A box that will work with all SDN software. Is Cisco participating? This is Cisco's big fear, that a commodity box will come along and hurt their business. Ahmad: We had our first engineering summit for OCP at MIT [two weeks ago] and we held a whole day workshop on networking. Cisco was at that meeting. They definitely know what's going on and they are participating in the conversations. So it's either a threat or an opportunity on how they respond from here. They are open to submit proposals and [see] if the user community selects them.
YouTubeMichael HartnettEveryone's got a different theory for what's been moving gold prices in recent years.Â  Many attribute it to the Fed's balance sheet. Some attribute it to the debt ceiling. Others point to ETFs. In his latest note to clients, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Michael Hartnett points to U.S. home prices, which saw its bottom when gold prices topped. Here's Hartnett: But the belly of the last deflationary beast was, is and remains real estate. And thus it was the trough in US real estate in late-2011 that has proved the true game-changer for financial markets and the real economy. The trough in real estate instantly caused rotation from safe havens to more leveraged, risky assets, a trend that as been gaining traction for the past year and a half. For example, the peak in gold prices (the worldâ€™s favorite â€œtail riskâ€ hedge), coincided with the trough in US home prices (Chart). Indeed, our private client base has reduced their effective gold holdings by 30% since late-2011. And in 2013, the momentum in US real estate is causing double-digit house pricegains, investors are reaching for any form of exposure to the asset class (Fannie Mae preferred shares have quadrupled in the past 12 weeks), while gold prices and other safe havens come under further selling pressure (our commodity strategists revised down their 2013 average gold price forecast (to $1,478/oz from $1,680/oz).

AFPA placard reading, "R like: Ri-Maflow, Re-use, Recycle, Revenue... Revolution!" displayed at the entrance of the Maflow plant on May 16, 2013, near Milan. A total of 330 workers at the factory were let go between 2010 and 2012 before it shut down.A group of Italian factory workers who lost their jobs at an auto component maker due to the recession have taken over their disused factory near Milan and are planning to set up a recycling business as they struggle for dignity. "We were considered rejects in society and we recycled ourselves," said Gigi Malabarba, an unemployed man who has joined the initiative. Their unusual project is illegal but tolerated by local authorities and the owner of the site, a company belonging to banking giant UniCredit. As Italy's longest post-war economic crisis drags on, theirs is a desperate measure for a desperate time in which there are precious few other jobs. The facade of the factory is covered in banners. Inside are dozens of members of "Ri-Maflow", which registered as a social cooperative in March. The idea took shape during 2012 as the workers struggled and failed to keep their factory open. A total of 330 workers at the Maflow plant were let go between 2010 and 2012 before it shut down. It has only just begun but the plan is to recycle and repair electronic equipment destined for scrap. A factory hall-turned-workshop already has piles of old computers, scuffed keyboards and tools. There are also plans to host regular organic and ethical goods markets and a large space dedicated to "ancient crafts", as well as a library. One corner of the factory houses two African refugees who escaped from former dictator Moamer Kadhafi's Libya. They have already set up their own small business -- a workshop to repair old bicycles. "There is no work elsewhere so we are going to invent it ourselves," said Michele Morini, 43, a former employee and member of Ri-Maflow. "But we needed a place so we returned to the ashes of Maflow," he said, adding that project members were hoping for some "beginner's luck" to recover the "dignity" they lost when their jobs vanished. "We hope we manage to create something that has meaning, that is environmentally useful, something that is relatively easy to launch and does not require the purchase of expensive equipment." Ri-Maflow is inspired by worker cooperatives from the 19th century that made up for the absence of a social welfare state and were based on "solidarity, equality and self-management", the movement said on its website. Members also drew parallels with similar factory occupations in Argentina, where dismissed workers took over their former places of employment after the devastating 2001 financial crisis. The aim is to employ between 200 and 300 people over the next two or three years. "The outlook is good," said Pietro Calvi, 46, another participant in the project. He said that the toughening up of European rules on recycling would favour their business as Italy still lags far behind in terms of waste disposal. Morini denied any political affiliation but said he hoped Ri-Maflow would make politicians reflect on "a critical situation, where the usual, conventional, banal answers no longer work. "I never thought I would reach this stage. I never saw myself as a revolutionary," he said. "Even moderates sometimes take desperate, risky measures they would have never thought of. It's very clear -- either that or they do not eat." Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
AFPPhilipp Roesler and Angela MerkelThe European Commission faces a difficult choice Wednesday -- stick to its principles and impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panel imports, or bow to German-led pressure and avoid a step many believe risks a full-scale trade war with Beijing. The stakes are high, commercially and politically. On the one hand, EU-China trade is worth more than 500 billion euros annually, a powerful incentive for everyone to keep calm at a time when both sides, and especially the 27-member EU, are looking to trade to boost growth and jobs. On the other, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, is caught between Germany, the bloc's paymaster and biggest economy which has come out openly against duties, and France, which favours them as a way of showing that the bloc will stand up to Beijing in trade disputes. Analysts say the Commission is in an uncomfortable place. "The Commission, given the significant and public divisions among member states, is in a very weak position," said consultant Sergio Marchi, a former Canadian trade minister and ambassador to the World Trade Organization. "It will probably seek an elegant way to save face but I'm not sure there is such a route," Marchi said, adding: "I think the Commission will need to swallow its pride on this one!" The Commission, however, does have some limited leeway. The tariffs to be announced Wednesday will be provisional, lasting six months, and so still allow room for negotiations with all parties. A final decision would come only in December, when EU member states would have to vote to make them permanent or not. May has already been a busy month and China upped the ante again Friday when it added an anti-dumping probe into EU chemical exports to an investigation of seamless pipes. These moves were set against the Commission's probe on solar panels and a possible examination of Chinese telecoms. German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said on Monday there was "no longer a need for penalties", a remark all the more pointed for being made in the presence of visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. "We are against protectionist measures, (we are) for open markets and fair competition," Roesler said while Li commented: "This position, that is what binds China with Germany and earns my appreciation." EU sources say Germany has mustered 17 other member states against the tariffs just as France insisted they were justified and that far from harming ties with China, would actually put them on a more even keel. "We will have the chance to tell our Chinese partners that we wish to broadly refashion trade between China and the European Union, including in renewable energy," said French Ecology and Energy Minister Delphine Batho, adding that "the rules of international trade must be applied." For his part, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, who has to make the decision on Wednesday, bluntly warned member states to be wary of China trying to influence the outcome. De Gucht told visiting Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan that "he was ready to negotiate a solution on the solar panels case," according to a spokesman. But De Gucht also said he was aware of the pressure exerted by China on EU member states and was more than ready to resist it. "It is the role of the European Commission to remain independent, to resist any external pressure and to see the 'big picture' for the benefit of Europe, its companies and workers based upon the evidence alone," he insisted Monday. "China has become the 28th member state of the EU," commented Daniel Cohn-Bendit, co-leader of the Greens in the European Parliament. "It influences the decision in 18 countries and it knows how to position itself." Meanwhile at the sharp end of the dispute, EU companies in China were hoping against any turn for the worse. "Who would not be concerned?" Davide Cucino, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce said of the prospects of a trade war. "We urge that both sides engage in friendly negotiations to reach any possible, amicable solutions to the issue." Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
Demand for sub-prime mortgage bonds, which are not backed by US government-controlled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, has surged since the start of last year, as yields on treasury bonds remain low. Returns jumped 41pc last year, and have climbed a further 12.7pc this year, according to data from Barclays. The demand has led to fears that investors could be taking risks so big that they will pave the way for a repeat of the financial collapse. â€œDebt-financed consumption supported by inflated asset prices is what led to the financial crisis of 2008. Itâ€™s amazing how willing we are to travel down that road again,â€ Peter Schiff, head of investment firm Euro Pacific Capital, said. â€œMost buyers cannot afford todayâ€™s prices without the combination of government guarantees and artificially low mortgage rates â€¦ When significantly higher interest rates eventually arrive, the fragile market will again be impacted.â€ The increase in demand for mortgage bonds has also been driven by an increase in the value of property in America, as borrowing costs fall, and consumer confidence rises. US house prices grew at their fastest rate in seven years in March, jumping 10.9pc year-on-year in Americaâ€™s 20 largest cities, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index. The same heady combination â€“ rising house prices and easy credit â€“ is also fuelling a buying spree, echoing the one that led to the 2008 disaster, some analysts claim. However, others do not think the scene is set for a repeat of the original sub-prime crisis, when investors piled into bonds based on loans for properties people could not afford. â€œThe vigilance is in place this time, in terms of not allowing people [to] make the same mistake,â€ Marcus Clancy, from Trepp, an analysis firm specialising in commercial property loans, said. Sceptics also point to the fact that home owners appear to be on a surer footing, with the rate of delinquency on certain mortgage bonds falling to its lowest level in five years. Michael Gaper, a senior economist at Barclays, agreed that the current frenzy for mortgage bonds was very different from the bubble five years ago. Banks have learnt their lessons and are naturally more cautious, he said. But Mr Clancy conceded that banks could be headed for a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis if the US Federal Reserve began winding down its fiscal stimulus. Ben Bernanke, the Fedâ€™s chairman, has said the reserve will not slam the breaks on its quantitative easing programme but has also warned that America could start weaning itself off the stimulus in the next few months if economic data appears strong.
