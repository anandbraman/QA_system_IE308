Screenshot from Broadway.com clipI'm not a big theater guy. Despite being a native New Yorker, the last Broadway show I saw might have been "Beatlemania," back in the 1970s. (Great show!) But my kids are into the performance thing. They're always staging "plays" and shooting "movies," etc. So for a few years I have been thinking that someday I should take them to a Broadway show. Then I sat next to a money manager at a dinner the other night who was raving about the new "Annie." I had seen the movie "Annie," so I figured I could manage to sit through the play. I knew it would be expensive--one good reason to avoid Broadway is the mind-boggling expense--but I figured "Annie" wouldn't be more expensive than any other show. And I also figured there was relatively low risk that my kids would hate it (an important consideration). My kids had seen the movie of "Annie," and they liked that. And they had only seen the movie about seven times, so I figured they would be at least modestly interested in the play. (Seven times is only moderate exposure for kid-repeat-viewing in the iPad age. Mine have probably seen "The Two Towers" fifteen times.) So I decided to take the family to see "Annie." I cracked open my computer.
James Montier never disappoints. †This time he discusses how hyperinflation is ìnot just a monetary phenomenonî (if that doesnít sound familiar to readers, it should). †His latest note out of GMO covers the subject of hyperinflations and heís obviously been reading MMT. †He writes: ìHowever, there is an alternative view of hyperinflations, one that I find much more credible than the quantity-theory based argument outlined above. This alternative viewpoint recognizes that money supply is endogenous (and hence that interest rates are exogenous), and that budget deficits are often caused by hyperinflations rather than being the†source of hyperinflations.  If simply ìprinting moneyî really did lead to hyperinflations, then we should expect to see hyperinflations all of the time. Any government that issues its own currency under a floating exchange rate effectively spends by printing money†(as a matter of logic, if the government is the sole issuer of currency, it has to spend before it can collect any taxes at all, otherwise there is nothing to pay the taxes with). Yet, rather than two-a-penny, hyperinflations are thankfully rare events, representing occasions when populations lose complete faith in their currencies.î Obviously, I have a bit of a beef there (though I came to many of the same conclusions on hyperinflation several years ago ñ see here). †Itís important to understand that the money supply is almost entirely endogenous as Montier states. †That is, money is created almost entirely by banks and used by everyone else. †The money supply has been outsourced by the government to private banks who rule the monetary roost. †This requires a more in-depth understanding than the simple idea of a ìcurrency issuerî. †As JKH has noted in the Contingent Institutional Approach, the US government, for instance, is a strategic currency issuer. † In essence, the US government harnesses the banking system in what is essentially a system that bribes them to bid at auctions. †The government basically leverages its enormous ability to tax the output of the private sector to have the banks do their bidding. † So, banks issue the money and the US government chooses to use this bank money. This doesnít mean the US government is not susceptible to hyperinflation just because it has the power to tax its output. †In fact, the loss or even reduction in the power to tax this output base has been the foundation for many hyperinflations. A sovereign government that cannot tax its output is essentially bankrupted (even though it will never technically ìrun out of moneyî). †But again, the money supply is truly endogenous. †It comes almost entirely from INSIDE the private sector. †So the key here is really understanding how BANKS issue almost all of our money. †In a balance sheet recession the odds of hyperinflation are extremely low because the money supply cannot expand substantially. †When you combine this with an extremely advanced nation with a powerful productive base and a sovereign that can tax that output the odds of a hyperinflation are extremely low.

Yan Biao Boey/flickrSingapore is one of the richest countries in the world. The city-state's 5 million people, crammed into an area barely larger than Chicago, generate the 6th-highest GDP in the world. It has the highest percentage of millionaire households in the world, according to BCG, and is known for its sophisticated investing environment (though some allege it is also a tax haven). It wasn't always so. For years, Singapore was a sleepy colonial backwater of the British Empire. Even after it became independent, many believed it¬†literally would cease to exist¬†as a functioning community. Lee Kuan Yew, regarded today as the founder of modern Singapore, had this to say about growing up there: The population was less than a million and most of Singapore was covered by mangrove swamps, rubber plantations, and secondary forest because rubber had failed, and forests around Mandai/Bukit Timah took its place. When he took control of the country in the '60s, not very much had changed. He had to launch a campaign to help Singapore "survive and prosper." Thanks to images taken by Flickr user Yin Biao Boey, annotated by us with contemporary¬†New York Times reports,¬†we take you back to this uncertain era in the country's history.¬†
But these aren't the only major issues that Wal-Mart faces.† "The companyís problems run much deeper," write the analysts at Tiburon Research Group's†Retail Geeks.† It's still not clear if Wal-Mart's price investment, which should drive traffic into its stores, is actually working, according to Tiburon. See, back in Q1 2012, Wal-Mart announced a new initiative. It would invest in price at both Walmart and Sam's Club in order to drive traffic into its stores.†It promised to pump $2 billion into retail pricing, then later in 2012, Wal-Mart†upped that number to $6 billion. And yet, Walmart store traffic slowed down in Q2 and Q3 relative to Q1. So there's a big question that needs to be answered: Is Wal-Mart's price investment actually effective? From Tiburon: Hereís the problem, following 4 consecutive quarters of improved traffic (Q4 2011 through Q3 2012), the core chain lapped an increased level of traffic in Q4 2012. Coinciding with the anniversary of an increased level of traffic at the core chain, the company planned for a much larger marketing spend in Q4 2012 (radio/TV). Therefore, it will be interesting to see if the core chainís traffic improved in Q4 2012 versus LY. If not, FY 2013 is setting up to be an ugly year for WMT. There are some fundamental†concerns about the health of Wal-Mart's core customers.†Wal-Mart's price investment is meant to help curtail that problem and it may not be working. One thing's for sure ó Wal-Mart's Q4 earnings will be very interesting come Feb. 21.
By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images CIVILISATION works only if those who enjoy its benefits are also prepared to pay their share of the costs. People and companies that avoid tax are therefore unpopular at the best of times, so it is not surprising that when governments and individuals everywhere are scrimping to pay their bills, attacks are mounting on tax havens and those who use them. In Europe the anger has focused on big firms. Amazon and Starbucks have faced consumer boycotts for using clever accounting tricks to book profits in tax havens while reducing their bills in the countries where they do business. David Cameron has put tackling corporate tax-avoidance at the top of the G8 agenda. America has taken aim at tax-dodging individuals and the banks that help them. Congress has passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which forces foreign financial firms to disclose their American clients. Any whiff of offshore funds has become a political liability. During last year's presidential campaign Mitt Romney was excoriated by Democrats for his holdings in the Cayman Islands. Now Jack Lew, Barack Obama's nominee for treasury secretary, is under fire for once having an interest in a Cayman fund. Getting rich people to pay their dues is an admirable ambition, but this attack is both hypocritical and misguided. It may be good populist politics, but leaders who want to make their countries work better should focus instead on cleaning up their own back yards and reforming their tax systems. The archetypal tax haven may be a palm-fringed island, but as our special report this week makes clear, there is nothing small about offshore finance. If you define a tax haven as a place that tries to attract non-resident funds by offering light regulation, low (or zero) taxation and secrecy, then the world has 50-60 such havens. These serve as domiciles for more than 2m companies and thousands of banks, funds and insurers. Nobody really knows how much money is stashed away: estimates vary from way below to way above $20 trillion. Not all these havens are in sunny climes; indeed not all are technically offshore. Mr Obama likes to cite Ugland House, a building in the Cayman Islands that is officially home to 18,000 companies, as the epitome of a rigged system. But Ugland House is not a patch on Delaware (population 917,092), which is home to 945,000 companies, many of which are dodgy shells. Miami is a massive offshore banking centre, offering depositors from emerging markets the sort of protection from prying eyes that their home countries can no longer get away with. The City of London, which pioneered offshore currency trading in the 1950s, still specialises in helping non-residents get around the rules. British shell companies and limited-liability partnerships regularly crop up in criminal cases. London is no better than the Cayman Islands when it comes to controls against money laundering. Other European Union countries are global hubs for a different sort of tax avoidance: companies divert profits to brass-plate subsidiaries in low-tax Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands. Reform should thus focus on rich-world financial centres as well as Caribbean islands, and should distinguish between illegal activities (laundering and outright tax evasion) and legal ones (fancy accounting to avoid tax). The best weapon against illegal activities is transparency, which boils down to collecting more information and sharing it better. Thanks in large part to America's FATCA, small offshore centres are handing over more data to their clients' home countries--while America remains shamefully reluctant to share information with the Latin American countries whose citizens hold deposits in Miami. That must change. Everyone could do more to crack down on the use of nominee shareholders and directors to hide the provenance of money. And they should make sure that information about the true "beneficial" owners of companies is collected, kept up-to-date and made more readily available to investigators in cases of suspected wrongdoing. There are costs to openness, but they are outweighed by the benefits of shining light on the shady corners of finance. Transparency will also help curb the more aggressive forms of corporate tax avoidance. As Starbucks's experience has shown, companies that shift money around to minimise their tax bills endanger their reputations. The more information consumers have about such dodges, the better. Moral pressure is not the whole answer, though: consumers get bored with campaigns, and governments should not bash companies for trying to reduce their tax bills, if they do so legally. In the end, tax systems must be reformed. Governments need to make it harder for companies to use internal ("transfer") pricing to avoid tax. Companies should be made to book activity where it actually takes place. Several federal economies, including America, already prevent companies from exploiting the differences between states' rules. An international agreement along those lines is needed. Governments also need to lower corporate tax rates. Tapping companies is inefficient: firms pass the burden on to others. Better to tax directly those who ultimately pay--whether owners of capital, workers or consumers. Nor do corporate taxes raise much money: barely more than 2% of GDP (8.5% of tax revenue) in America and 2.7% in Britain. Abolishing corporate tax would create its own problems, as it would encourage rich people to turn themselves into companies. But a lower rate on a broader base, combined with vigilance by the tax authorities, would be more efficient and would probably raise more revenue: America, whose companies face one of the rich world's highest corporate-tax rates on their worldwide income, also has some of the most energetic tax-avoiders. These reforms would not be easy. Governments that try to lower corporate tax rates will be accused of caving in to blackmailing capitalists. Financial centres and incorporation hubs, from the City of London to Delaware, will fight any attempt to tighten their rules. But if politicians really want to tax the missing $20 trillion, that's where they should start. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
Privateer HoldingsMichael Blue, Brendan Kennedy, and Christian Goh of Privateer Holdings BRENDAN KENNEDY received an engineering degree, started a software firm and sold its assets to Boeing, studied for a Yale MBA and then joined a Silicon Valley bank reviewing new-business proposals. His latest venture takes a sharp turn off the beaten path. Mr Kennedy has become an investor in the marijuana business. The business case for funding the cannabis industry rests on two things. The first is its scale. Many of the novel ideas Mr Kennedy appraised during his job in Silicon Valley, from electric cars (Fisker and Tesla) to daily coupons (Groupon), had potentially large markets. Marijuana is already an established business. After six months of research and interviews with growers, dispensaries, trade publications and political organisations, Mr Kennedy believes the American market to be worth $50 billion. The second is that despite its heft, the cannabis industry operates like, well, a grass-roots movement. The drug's legal status is messy: although medical marijuana is legal in 18 states and in the District of Columbia, cannabis is illegal elsewhere in America. For social reasons, too, the industry is unfinanceable through normal channels. People in the business lack expertise in everything from branding to staffing. @BedfordLPT/TwitterKa-ching! Data are scarce. Formal benchmarks for quality, such as tests for the presence of contaminants including mould, mildew and pesticides, do not exist. Neither do proper classifications for the different varieties of the drug. Thousands of strains of cannabis can be grown, many with odd names like Apollo 11, Sour Kush, Broke Diesel and the less-than-mellow Chernobyl. Characteristics vary, too. Some strains depress; some stimulate; some suppress nausea, a key reason why marijuana is used by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Consumers cannot compare what is legally produced in California with what is legally produced in Colorado-- to say nothing of what is illegally sold in New York's Washington Square Park (where a small army of salesmen all have the same patter: "Smoke. The good stuff"). At first, Mr Kennedy wanted to create a cannabis-focused venture-capital fund but concerns about legal liabilities, as well as a desire to take majority stakes in portfolio firms, led him and a few partners to set up a different sort of fund, called Privateer Holdings. Its first investment is a website, Leafly, which offers user reviews on dispensaries and varieties of cannabis. An app was created for both Android and iPhones and there are now 50,000 downloads a month (for the forgetful, the password hint is "favourite strain"). Work is proceeding on how to add information on things like each variety's content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis. Mr Kennedy says Privateer has received over 200 investor pitches since November: potential acquisitions include a testing lab and a clothing company. The fund is now raising another $7m privately, and a public offering is possible once the Securities and Exchange Commission finalises new rules on "crowd-sourced funding" and small public flotations. That will write a new chapter in the story of high finance. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
Twitter Barron's goes there. (Economics editor Gene Epstein is not President Obama's biggest fan.) Here's the lede from the latest cover story: In his State of the Union speech last Tuesday, President Obama concluded that "the State of our Union is stronger." The big question is: stronger than what?  Federal debt is a record $12.2 trillion, or 76% of the nation's annual output of goods and services. While that's still well below Greece's 153%, we're headed steadily in the wrong direction. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, adjusted by†Barron's†to account for recent tax increases and other factors, if the U.S. doesn't raise taxes further and cut spending dramatically, the national debt could easily reach 153% of economic output by 2035. These are not just numbers. If the U.S. national debt continues ballooning, we can be sure of a deep, long-lasting recession -- very likely a depression -- sometime in the next two to three decades. The unemployment rate could easily surge to 20%. In the article, Epstein runs through a common argument ñ that hiking taxes alone won't put the U.S. on a sustainable fiscal trajectory. Thus, he thinks politicians should embrace the upcoming sequester of spending cuts set to take effect March 1. Read more at Barron's &gt; (h/t Sara Eisen)
ReutersRussia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (C) rises to leave after a family photo during a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at the Manezh Exhibition Center in Moscow February 16, 2013.MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Group of 20 nations declared on Saturday there would be no currency war and deferred plans to set new debt-cutting targets, underlining broad concern about the fragile state of the world economy. Japan's expansive policies, which have driven down the yen, escaped direct criticism in a statement thrashed out in Moscow by policymakers from the G20, which spans developed and emerging markets and accounts for 90 percent of the world economy. Analysts said the yen, which has dropped 20 percent as a result of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies to reflate the Japanese economy, may now continue to fall. "The market will take the G20 statement as an approval for what it has been doing -- selling of the yen," said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London. "No censure of Japan means they will be off to the money printing presses." After late-night talks, finance ministers and central bankers agreed on wording closer than expected to a joint statement issued last Tuesday by the Group of Seven rich nations backing market-determined exchange rates. A draft communiqu√© on Friday had steered clear of the G7's call for economic policy not to be targeted at exchange rates. But the final version included a G20 commitment to refrain from competitive devaluations and stated monetary policy would be directed only at price stability and growth. "The mood quite clearly early on was that we needed desperately to avoid protectionist measures ... that mood permeated quite quickly," Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told reporters, adding that the wording of the G20 statement had been hardened up by the ministers. As a result, it reflected a substantial, but not complete, endorsement of Tuesday's proclamation by the G7 nations - the United States, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy. As with the G7 intervention, Tokyo said it gave it a green light to pursue its policies unchecked. "I have explained that (Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe's administration is doing its utmost to escape from deflation and we have gained a certain understanding," Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters. "We're confident that if Japan revives its own economy that would certainly affect the world economy as well. We gained understanding on this point." Flaherty admitted it would be difficult to gauge if domestic policies were aimed at weakening currencies or not. NO FISCAL TARGETS The G20 also made a commitment to a credible medium-term fiscal strategy, but stopped short of setting specific goals as most delegations felt any economic recovery was too fragile. The communiqu√© said risks to the world economy had receded but growth remained too weak and unemployment too high. "A sustained effort is required to continue building a stronger economic and monetary union in the euro area and to resolve uncertainties related to the fiscal situation in the United States and Japan, as well as to boost domestic sources of growth in surplus economies," it said. A debt-cutting pact struck in Toronto in 2010 will expire this year if leaders fail to agree to extend it at a G20 summit of leaders in St Petersburg in September. The United States says it is on track to meet its Toronto pledge but argues that the pace of future fiscal consolidation must not snuff out demand. Germany and others are pressing for another round of binding debt targets. "We had a broad consensus in the G20 that we will stick to the commitment to fulfill the Toronto goals," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. "We do not have any interest in U.S.-bashing ... In St. Petersburg follow-up-goals will be decided." The G20 put together a huge financial backstop to halt a market meltdown in 2009 but has failed to reach those heights since. At successive meetings, Germany has pressed the United States and others to do more to tackle their debts. Washington in turn has urged Berlin to do more to increase demand. Backing in the communiqu√© for the use of domestic monetary policy to support economic recovery reflected the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to monetary stimulus through quantitative easing, or QE, to promote recovery and jobs. QE entails large-scale bond buying -- $85 billion a month in the Fed's case -- that helps economic growth but has also unleashed destabilising capital flows into emerging markets. A commitment to minimize such "negative spillovers" was an offsetting point in the text that China, fearful of asset bubbles and lost export competitiveness, highlighted. "Major developed nations (should) pay attention to their monetary policy spillover," Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao was quoted by state news agency Xinhua as saying in Moscow. Russia, this year's chair of the G20, admitted the group had failed to reach agreement on medium-term budget deficit levels and expressed concern about ultra-loose policies that it and other emerging economies say could store up trouble for later. On currencies, the G20 text reiterated its commitment last November, "to move more rapidly toward mores market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments". It said disorderly exchange rate movements and excess volatility in financial flows could harm economic and financial stability.

A survey from Northern Trust found that three quarters of millionaires surveyed said they are better off, or as well off, as they were in 2007 ó the peak for both wealth and sheer numbers of America's millionaires. Most cited improved investment returns as their reason for feeling better off. (Read More:†US Will Add Five Million Millionaires By 2017) That confidence may soon start translating into hiring. Eighty percent of wealthy business owners say they plan to recruit more workers or keep their staff levels stable over the next 18 to 24 months. One in five plan to make capital investments in upgrading computers and other technology over the same period.† Nearly a third blamed their negative outlook on the Obama administration. In short, today's millionaires are feeling prosperous in their private life, but pessimistic about public life. "The survey results mirror our clients' divergent views around U.S fiscal policy," said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust's Chief Investment Officer for Wealth Management. (Read More:†Cities That Are Minting Millionaires the Fastest) When it comes to investment goals, more than a third of wealthy investors said growing wealth was their goal. About one quarter focus on generating income and the rest say capital preservation is their goal.

During most of the 2000s, I patiently sat on the sidelines while the paper-fueled run up in asset prices (primarily stocks and real estate) in my home country took off. I always thought that when the cheap and easy credit eventually ran out, prices would come tumbling back down. And when that finally happened in 2008, I jumped in. One investment that seemed obvious to me was betting against commercial real estate investment trusts (REITs). All the research I had done indicated that commercial REITs were in WAY over their heads and doomed to fall. Initially, my strategy did well. As expected, the commercial REITs took a nosedive, and I was making money. Until Obama screwed me. After implementing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (better known as TARP), President Obama effectively bailed out the REITsÖ eradicating their losses and sending their stocks soaring. Since I was betting on the REITs to fall, I was practically wiped out. I couldnít believe itóI had made the right call. The REITs were a disaster. And if the free market had been allowed to function, I would have made a lot of money. But I ended up taking it on the chin thanks to government intervention. The REITs were too big to fail. I apparently was not. When I set out to rebuild my capital again, I kept things very simple: gold, silver, and Chilean property. These asset classes have performed extraordinarily well. And as much as I believe in the precious metals premise, I have actually been reducing my positions in order to buy more Chilean property. Outside of Santiago and other urban areas in Chile, most real estate transactions here are done ìal contadoî or paid in full. People have to save up for years and actually have the money in hand before they make a purchase meaning downside risk is very limited. In other words, this is not an asset being inflated by central bankers; Iím not riding a wave of easy credit, but rather speculating in the future growth of this vibrant economy. Month after month, there are obvious signs of improvement. Roads are paved. New highways are built. Electrical infrastructure is improved. Each time this happens, property prices can double in a short period of time. If zoning is changed at the same time as infrastructure projects are going in, you can sometimes replace the word ìdoubleî from the previous sentence with ìtripleî or ìquadrupleî. Plus, as Simon often writes about, thereís nothing like an investment that bears fruit, both literally and figuratively. When you have fertile soil and solid water sources, your investment cannot go to zero. It makes it hard to get hurt. These sorts of situations are hard to find in todayís world and thereís no doubt in my mind that sometime soon, a lot more people outside of Chile are going to catch on to this anomaly. Until that happens, Iím happy to be one of the few, along with Simon, to be investing ahead of the crowd in this thriving country. Read more posts on Sovereign Man ª
One of the most interesting things about the S&amp;P 500 rally that has extended over the past three months without respite is what is driving it. This is, of course, subject to some debate, but we can at least identify a few things that don't appear driving it. Is it the U.S. economic data? Probably not ñ the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index is negative. (It's turned up in recent days, but it's fallen sharply throughout much of the rally.) Citi Research What about earnings expectations? That doesn't appear to be the case either ñ earnings expectations continue on a steady decline, even as the market rises. FactSet Why are people buying, then? There are likely a wide variety of reasons. We think one of the big ones is probably the special dividends paid out ahead of the fiscal cliff in late 2012 being reinvested in 2013. BMO strategist Brian Belski advances some interesting information in his latest note: everyone is just using this rally to play catch-up. He gets the sense from his conversations with clients that this is the case, he writes: One topic that comes up quite frequently in our client conversations is the desire to increase beta (or risk) within portfolios. From our perspective, investors appear to be chasing the market and not paying enough attention to fundamentals, since many fund managers have underperformed over the past few years and view ìrisk-onî type strategies as a way to play catch-up as market momentum persists. This is just another interesting example of the excessive optimism that appears to have characterized this rally.†(Most strategists now expect a correction soon.) The problem, according to Belski, is that fund managers are still stuck in the "risk-on/risk-off" mindset that has dominated the post-crisis investment landscape.† Belski, like several other equity strategists, believes the market is transitioning into a period of secular stock market outperformance, notwithstanding the pullback that is expected in the near term. According to Belski, "risk-on/risk-off" investing is dead. And it's been dead for two years. "From a purely quantitative perspective," he writes, "fundamentally driven strategies have been performing extremely well, compared with 'risk-on' type strategies for much of the past two years." The chart below basically shows that investment strategies based on valuation, growth, and earnings quality have been working better than those based on technical analysis and volatility. Obviously, we are in an extremely low-volatility environment. BMO Investment Strategy Group, FactSet, CompuStat, IBES Whether that continues or takes a sharp turn down again is, of course, an open question. The economic data may turn up, but earnings expectations are still declining. Meanwhile, unless investors expect the next correction to send the market back into a "risk-on/risk-off" frenzy on the order not seen in two years, it may make sense to start focusing on the fundamentals a bit more.

INFLATION may have ruined "How to marry a millionaire" as a good film title, but there is still something magical about $1m.† How long would it take for an average person to earn that special sum? To find out The Economist looked at how much the main breadwinner in an average household makes each year (before tax). On this measure, America creates the swiftest millionaires, and also the most (around 5m households, or 4% of the total). South of the border, Mexicans can expect to toil for three centuries to earn the same. For those struggling to imagine $1m, consider this: stacked up and denominated in $100 notes, it would reach over a metre high and weigh ten kilograms (22 lb).

Morgan StanleyThe world is changing, and nowhere is that better illustrated than in a good series of charts. Luckily, we've seen no shortage of excellent charts this week that amply illustrate the changes underway. The best charts this week touch on everything from plunging beer consumption to the longest-lasting vehicles on the road. Now, let's go to the charts.
The Fed reported on Friday that Industrial Production declined by 0.1% in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, after rising in December by 0.4 percent. ¬†The consensus estimate was for an increase of 0.2%, so it was a miss. The actual, not seasonally adjusted number rose by 0.6% month to month and was up 2.4% year to year, the same as in December. The growth rate slowed in 2012 versus the first 2 years after the economy bottomed, but it has been stable for the past year. Changes in January versus December have varied widely over the past 10 years. There‚Äôs no seasonal pattern evident, therefore no reason to apply a seasonal adjustment (Why¬†I don‚Äôt use¬†seasonally adjusted (SA) data). ¬†In 2012 January was also up 0.6% and in 2011 it was up 0.3%. The only years better than this year over the past 10 years were in bungee rebound years from the pits of recession in 2010 and 2003. ¬† The average January change over the past 10 years was virtually unchanged at less than -0.1%. Stock prices had been heading toward an overbought level relative to industrial projection in 2010-11 but that stopped in 2011. The ratio of the S&amp;P 500 to the Industrial Production Index turned flat in response to the Fed holding the SOMA flat from mid 2011 until November 2012 when the Fed‚Äôs QE3 MBS purchases began to settle. It added Treasury purchases to that in January (which I refer to as QE4). Those purchases are reflected in the green line on the chart moving up. That will continue for as long as QE3 and 4 continue. I would expect industrial production to tag along. Stocks are apparently becoming expensive relative to industrial production. After holding flat for most of 2012, the SPX/Industrial Production Index ratio began to rise again in January, almost reaching the 2007 highs in this measure. ¬†That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that ‚Äúthe end is nigh‚Äù for the bull market. ¬†If industrial production expands ¬†faster as QE3 and 4 cash trickles down through the economy, the rise in stock prices can continue for a while. In 2007 when this indicator was peaking along with the stock market, the Fed had already pulled the plug on growing the SOMA. That‚Äôs what ended the bull market, not the fact that stocks were extended. I would expect something similar to end this bull move. The SPX now in excess of 15 times the industrial production index is certainly a yellow flag. It gives some reason, other than just some jawboning by more hawkish Fedheads, to be on the alert for a move by the Fed to slow the growth of its balance sheet this year. That would put an end to the bull market.

We are far enough and deep enough into the most heroic monetary and fiscal efforts ever undertaken to finally ask, why aren't these measures working? Or at least we should be. Oddly, many in DC, on Wall Street, and the Federal Reserve continue to steadfastly refuse to include anything in their approaches and frameworks other than "more of the same." So we are treated to an endless parade of news items that seek to convince us that a bottom is in and that we've 'turned the corner' ‚Äì often on the flimsy basis that in the past things have always gotten better by now. The framework we operate from around here is simply encapsulated in the observation that there has never been global economic recovery with oil prices above $100 a barrel. ¬†That is shorthand for the idea that oil is the primary lubricant of economic growth and that it is not just the amount of oil one has to burn but also the quality, or net energy, of the oil that matters.¬† If we want to understand why all of the tried-and-true monetary and fiscal efforts have failed, we have to appreciate the headwinds that are offered by both a condition of too-much-debt and expensive energy.¬† Neither alone can account for the economic malaise that stalks the world. Trillions have been printed and injected into the world's economies, and yet things seem to be barely limping along, requiring constant attention and interventions from both fiscal and monetary authorities.¬† The broadest measure of money in the U.S. is Money of Zero Maturity, or MZM.¬† Note that it has increased by an astonishing 44% since the start of the crisis:  We could similarly look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet, or excess reserves, or a dozen other indicators that all say the same thing: The money supply has been expanded enormously. And what do we have to show for it? Not much. Since 2005 real ‚Äì that is, inflation-adjusted ‚Äì GDP has only expanded by 0.9% on an annualized basis.¬† On a nominal basis (not inflation-adjusted), the number is only 2.9%, far below the 5%-6% required to sustain a banking system dependent on exponential growth in that range. In a very nice piece of work entitled Our Investment Sinkhole Problem, Gail Tverberg put up this handy and extremely important chart:  Oil and GDP are highly correlated and always have been.¬† The general observation is that growth in GDP is usually higher than growth in oil consumption - as growth in oil consumption powers economic growth.¬† Without growth in oil consumption, GDP growth doesn't advance. Back in 2009, in a piece entitled Oil - The Coming Supply Crunch (Part I), I calculated that every 1% increase in global GDP was associated with a 0.25% increase in oil consumption ‚Äì in other words, a roughly 4:1 ratio. Since 2007, something quite remarkable has happened in the world of oil, and that has been a decline in the consumption of oil in the U.S. and Europe -- with China and India pretty much making up the difference for everything that the West didn't consume. That, plus a dramatic increase in the price of oil were the only ways to balance out the fact that since 2005 oil production has been essentially dead flat:  If the view that oil consumption and economic growth are linked is correct, then we might easily imagine that simply making money cheaper and more widely available would do little to boost the real economy. Sure all that funny money will boost asset prices, but in this story, the tail does not and cannot wag the dog.¬† Stock prices may rise, but unemployment will not budge.¬† Bonds will become more expensive, but GDP will stall. Now the Fed is finally showing signs of saying hey, what gives? as its policies do little to improve the things it publicly admits to wanting to improve. In this recent speech by Janet Yellen, Vice Chair of the Fed, you can see her nibbling all around the edges of the mystery: In the three years after the Great Recession ended, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaged only 2.2 percent per year. In the same span of time following the previous 10 U.S. recessions, real GDP grew, on average, more than twice as fast--at a 4.6 percent annual rate. ¬†So, why has the economy's recovery from the Great Recession been so weak? (...) [T]he unprecedented level and persistence of long-term unemployment in this recovery have prompted some to ask whether a significant share of unemployment since the recession is due to¬†structural¬†problems in labor markets and not simply a¬†cyclical shortfall in aggregate demand. This question is important for anyone committed to the goal of maximum employment, because it implicitly asks whether the best we can hope for, even in a healthy economy, is an unemployment rate significantly higher than what has been achieved in the past. For the Federal Reserve, the answer to this question has important implications for monetary policy. If the current, elevated rate of unemployment is largely cyclical, then the straightforward solution is to take action to raise aggregate demand.  If unemployment is instead substantially structural, some worry that attempts to raise aggregate demand will have little effect on unemployment and serve only to stoke inflation. (Source) As I said, the Fed is nibbling, but it is not yet even close to the center of the conundrum.¬† Yes, there are structural issues at play, but they have as much to do with expensive oil as they do with any great shifts in labor market trends.¬† The main part to consider here is contained in the last two bolded parts in the above quote.¬† If the Fed is just chucking more and more money into an economy that has fundamentally shifted into a lower gear, then all they are doing is laying the tinder for future inflation. Given the amounts involved, the potential for a very punishing period of inflation is quite high, for reasons often discussed here, such as in the recent article QE For Dummies. This leads us back to Gail Tverberg's piece on economic sinkholes.¬† Her main point in that piece was that in times past, higher investment led to higher output.¬† That is, spending led to economic growth, especially investment spending. Carefully buried within higher oil prices are higher prices for every single economic activity that uses them.¬† Along with diminishing ore yields come incrementally higher costs to simply, extract, and refine those ores, let alone fashion them into something useful. Gail writes: All types of mineral extraction, but particularly oil, eventually reach the situation where it takes an increasing amount of investment (money, energy products, and often water) to extract a given amount of resource. This situation arises because companies extract the cheapest to extract resources first, and move on to the more expensive to extract resources later. As consumers, we recognize the situation through rising commodity prices. There is generally a real issue behind the rising prices -- not enough resource available in readily accessible locations -- so we need to dig deeper, or apply more ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù solutions. These high tech solutions indirectly require more investment and more energy, as well. While we don‚Äôt stop to think about what is happening, the reality is that increasingly less oil (or other product such as natural gas, coal, gold, or copper) is being produced, for the same investment dollar. As long as the price of the product keeps rising sufficiently to cover the higher cost of extraction, the investor is happy, even if the cost of the resource is becoming unbearably high for consumers. ¬†(Source) The summary here is that it takes more and more to achieve less and less.¬† The old form of economic growth is no longer with us, but the Fed still doesn't get it.¬† It still has its eyes firmly trained on economic indicators and equations, having not yet raised its gaze into the real world where limits are being reached. As Gail nicely encapsulates, many of those limits are carefully hidden from view as a slightly but steadily reducing net energy for oil seeps into every nook and cranny of our complex economy. The sinkholes that we are facing now are extraordinary.¬† Some of them are quite literal, and numerous, as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania is demonstrating: Jan 31, 2013 HARRISBURG, Pa.‚ÄîWith midnight approaching on New Year's Eve, Sherri Lewis and her two children knelt to pray for a better year ahead. A few minutes later, she heard a rumbling that sounded like fireworks. The ground outside her apartment had opened up, revealing a municipal disaster that shows how far this city's finances have sunk. A sinkhole, measuring about 50 feet long and eight feet deep, had swallowed Ms. Lewis's street, damaging water and gas pipes and forcing more than a dozen residents to evacuate one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. "I thought the world was ending,'' says Ms. Lewis, 42 years old. Harrisburg officials have identified at least 40 other sinkholes around the 50,000-person city. The combination of particularly sandy soil and leaky pipes under Harrisburg's streets make it susceptible to sinkholes, city officials say. But Harrisburg has a bigger problem: The Pennsylvania capital can't afford to replace many of the aging pipes, some of which date back to the 19th century.  The metaphor perfectly offered by Harrisburg is that once you run out economy, your current infrastructure alone may be well beyond your means to maintain. The embodied energy in just our existing property, plant, and equipment is enormous.¬† Nearly every high-tech dream ‚Äì of a kinder, gentler future where 9 billion people somehow enjoy higher average standards of living than the current 7 billion ‚Äì requires an extraordinary investment of energy. Left out of this dream is a crisp articulation of exactly where that energy will come from and when we will begin to transition to prioritizing its use towards building and maintaining all of that new infrastructure.¬† It's not enough to merely buy electric cars, should they ever be manufactured in sufficient quantities, because we also need new grid components, electrical storage, generation, and a thousand other components to pull it off. I note that with every passing year, more and more internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are manufactured and sold, not fewer and fewer.¬† The past 7 years has seen the number of new ICE vehicles sold grow at a compounded rate of 3.7% per annum, and at that rate, 2013 should see more than 80,000,000 sold.¬† That's up from just over 50,000,000 only ten years ago. Every one of those represents the investment of energy and capital that will consume our remaining oil at the expense of anything else we might choose to do with that oil, such as maintain our current infrastructure as we build out the next one. As we dump more and more money into the economy, hoping with all our collective might that it will once again sputter back to life and lift all fortunes and boats, too few are asking what happens if it does not. If there are other factors at work here besides a simple case of too much debt, then the Fed is not only barking up the wrong tree, but is unaware that a very dangerous animal with a bad attitude is resting up there. These are truly extraordinary times.¬† I am in awe of the number of otherwise professional investors who believe that the Fed has things safely in hand.¬† The amount of market insanity and complete disconnect from reality has me thankful that I already lived through a similar time and can keep things in perspective now. That time was 2005 to 2007, when I was trading quite actively and thought the world had gone mad.¬† Nothing made sense, because I was trying make sense of things that could not be made sense of.¬†¬† In times of extraordinarily abundant liquidity and loose monetary policies, all that has to be understood is that financial assets tend to run up in price during such moments. The fact that this all ended quite badly then does little to make me think this time is going to end any better.¬† Thin-air money, attempting to print one's way to prosperity, and spending more than you have are proven losers in the history books. Yet here we are, doubling down ‚Äì we're all in and I guess there's no turning back now.¬† The Fed is going to keep with the program until forced to change by circumstances. As I see it, the economy is broken and it will stay that way.¬† Our only hope for an alternative would be to immediately cut our losses in those enterprises that do not make sense in a world of increasingly expensive liquid fuels, and invest heavily in those things that will help us transition to a future without fossil fuels. I am quite aware that many decades‚Äô worth of fossil fuels remain, but equally aware that all energy transitions require four to six decades under ideal conditions where one is transitioning to a higher quality fuel source and capital is expanding.¬† And under less-than-ideal conditions, where we are transitioning to a lower density energy source (as all alternative energy sources are) and capital is shrinking?¬† There we might imagine it could take longer than usual; a 100-year transition period is not out of the question. In the meantime, the best I can tell you is that the markets are reflecting liquidity, not reality, and that until and unless the world suddenly starts to produce a lot more crude oil and the U.S. and Europe increase their consumption of it, I will remain quite skeptical of all pronouncements of recovery in the West.
